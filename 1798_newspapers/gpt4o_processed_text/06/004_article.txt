Notwithstanding the fa-
vorable aspect of the prevailing
disease being nearly exterminated
—yet it behoves those inhabitants
who may have removed, and
whose dwellings remain shut,
to cause them not only to be ef-
fectually fumigated, but white-
washed and aired, previous to
their return.—It is uncertain to
decide what effect the present
changeable weather may produce
—Hopes are entertained of a con-
tinuance of the temperate, for a
few weeks; in which case, no
hazard can result, by a return of
our friends & neighbours.—This
would indeed be pleasing, and
is devoutly wished—But—
whilst in the fervor of our hopes,
we contemplate a return of our
former blessings, let not the opu-
lent—the benevolent forget the
numerous families who are de-
prived of their heads—the many
orphans who are totally depend-
ant on their charity—and who,
were it not for the unremitting
attentions of the Board of Health,
would have languished and died
in want!—The approach of
an inclement season, will meet
many poor families unprepared!
but the same benevolence that
upheld the stranger, and provid-
ed for the orphan, will surely
extend its influence to the sup-
port of the unfortunate.
