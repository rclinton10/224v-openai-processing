Young Men, from the age of 16 to 24.

To JOHN ADAMS,
President of the United States.

AT a period, when a powerful and
perfidious nation, aspiring to the domi-
nation of the world, annuls in the ca-
reer of her pride, all bonds of national
amity; when, the most conciliating
measures which the pacific disposition of
our government has adopted, have been
repelled with indignity, SILENCE
would become COWARDICE, and
NEUTRALITY, TREASON.

At this eventful crisis, the Young Men
of Boston, solemnly impressed with the
ideas of independence, which they have
derived from their ancestors, in that
unequivocal language which admits of
no adulation, beg leave to express to the
First Magistrate of the Union, their
sentiments and resolutions.

Ushered into life at a time when our
fathers were struggling for the rights to
which God and Nature entitled them,
we date our existence coeval with the
independence of our country. With
our first breath we imbibed a detestation
of servility to any nation, and we have
not yet learned to submit to the humi-
liation of foreign control.

As Americans, we feel an enthusiasm
in applauding your arduous administra-
tion, together with that of your illus-
trious predecessor, ever designated by the
firmest virtue, which danger has not
been able to appal and obloquy has in
vain assailed. While we have admired
the dignified moderation, which has
marked the successive attempts at a re-
conciliation with our Gallic allies, we
have witnessed with regret our proffered
terms of adjustment, contemptuously
rejected by the rapacity of avarice, and
the insolence of power. The insulting
demands by which France has so glar-
ingly developed her punic faith, and her
insidious designs, we conceive would
be more characteristic of the despotic
requisitions of a conquerer, than of pro-
posals to a high spirited, and we believe
an unconquerable people.

Although we presume not to arro-
gate to ourselves the office of judging
on intricate questions of politics, yet
where gratitude claims the tribute, we
must feelingly eulogize the unshuffled
patriotism and uniform wisdom of our
Supreme Executive.

Justly appreciating the sweets of peace
and the reign of equal laws, spurning
acquiescence to any presumptuous pow-
er to the degradation of national hon-
our, and determined to guard the in-
violability of our Constitution, as the
palladium of our rights, we the Youth
of Boston, united by indissoluble ties in
one common love to our country, most
solemnly offer, when its voice demands
the energy of action to sacrifice our
youthful prospects, and our lives, in
unnerving the arm of sedition, and re-
pelling the inroads of oppression ; fer-
vently according in those noble senti-
ments that "neutrality ought never to
be purchased by the violation of public
faith, the tarnishing of moral character,
or the abandonment of Independence."
