THOSE gentlemen who publish newspapers in the United States, are requested, if agreeable, to exchange GAZETTES with the Editor, and forward them by the address of "E. A. JENKS, Portland." Those liberal Printers who wish for a dissemination of Federal Principles, in this extremity of the Union, will doubtless comply.â€”It is here proper to inform those who have received letters offering an equivalent, signed by the person who was to have been concerned in this paper, that they are void on my part; and that THE GAZETTE only is intended. Printers of daily gazettes, will send as many as they please, and receive the cordial thanks of their humble servant,

E. A. JENKS.
