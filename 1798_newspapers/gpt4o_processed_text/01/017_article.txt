Dear Sir,

We transmit to you in this inclosure, our last letter to the Minister of Foreign Relations; although dated the 17th ult. it was not on account of the time taken to translate so long a letter, delivered until the 31st. In our communications here, although we have, agreeably to your instructions, written in our own language, we at the same time have taken the precaution, lest our meaning should be misrepresented or misunderstood, to accompany them with an accurate translation. We have not yet received any answer to this communication, and should no notice be taken of it in a few days, we shall apply in a more explicit manner for our passports.

The councils have passed the decree mentioned in No. 5, as having been recommended by the Directory, to capture and condemn all neutral vessels laden in part or in whole with the manufactures or productions of England, or its possessions. We inclose you the official copy of the report on that subject, and shall represent to this government the injustice and injury which it must inevitably occasion us.

We have the honor to be, with great respect, Your most obedient humble servants,

Charles C. Pinckney,
J. Marshall,
E. Gerry.

Col. Pickering,
