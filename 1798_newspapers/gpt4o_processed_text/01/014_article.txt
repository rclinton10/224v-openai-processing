'Tis good, 'tis noble, to see the manly youth  
Of our free country, warm'd by the godlike  
Spirit of their sires, rise the firm bulwark  
Of their nation's rights. The aged statesmen,  
And the good old chiefs, with joy glance backward  
From the cold eve of life, and with delight  
Behold their long-fought freedom safe.
