Chicago, December 31.-The Tribune to-
day prints the text of Admiral Montejo's
defense under courtmartial proceedings
for his defeat at Manila. The bulk of
the blame is charged by the admiral not
to himself or his fleet, but to the Spanish
government for its unprepared condition.
He also claims that Admiral Dewey kept
out of range of the Spanish guns--a pro-
ceeding which Montejo refers to as "a
retreat." Montejo says:
"The only preparation that had been
made for war was made by the Ameri-
cans, who were business and arranged
The
everything with pencil and paper.
Initial velocity of our cannon was 510
meters; that of the smallest cannon of
Admiral
cur enemies was meters.
Dewey, with pencil in hand, noted the
thickness of his mantlets and casements,
and knew what energy was required to
penetrate them. He also knew exactly
the weight of the most powerful projec-
tile of our ships, and by a simple mathe-
matical calculation he arrived at the dis-
tance at which he could light without
himself receiving any harm.
Thus he
ascertained that he could fight at a dis-
tance of 2,000 or 2,000 meters with abso-
lute impnuity. The situation, therefore,
was just this: We were vulnerable to
all the projectiles of the enemy, and this
the enemy well knew, while he got out
of reach of our cannon and remained out
of reach all the while."
Montejo adds:
Admiral
"In order to give an idea of our mis-
erable situation I may mention that we
had only fourteen torpedoes for the de-
fense of 2,000 meters of space and that
the cable, which we obtained in Hong
Kong, was only long enough for five tor-
pedoes and, therefore, only five torpedoes
could be placed."
PRICE OF DANISH WEST INDIES
United States Is Said To Be Trading

London, January 1.-The Copenhagen

The sale of the Danish West Indies to the
United States bids fair to be accom-
plished. The Danish Captain Christmas,
who has influential connections in the
United States and who has secured the
support of President McKinley, Admiral
Dewey and a number of influential Amer-
fean senators, is acting as intermediary
between the two governments, direct of-
ficial communication being impossible for
Denmark after repeated fallures in pre-
vious attempts. For several days an at-

A THOUSAND REBELS ROUTED.
Manila, December 27.-Colonel Lockett,
with a force of 2,500, including artillery,
attacked this morning a strong force
of insurgents entrenched in the moun-
tains near Montalbon, about five miles
northeast of San Mateo. The enemy was
completely routed, the Americans pur-
suing them through the hills, amid which
they fled in every direction.
The
Four Americans were wounded.
Filipinos' loss was large, resulting from
a heavy infantry and artillery fire for
three hours into the trenches.
It is supposed that the insurgents were
those who were driven out of San Mateo
on the day General Lawton was killed.
They numbered probably a thousand.
A dozen lines of insurgent trenches cov-
ered the steep trail through the hills and
likewise the valley below, along which
the Americans passed. The main attack-
Ing party consisted of the Forty-sixth
volunteer Infantry, a troop of cavalry
and artillery, Colonel Lockett command-
ing in person. The rest of the command
operated from remote points in an en-
deavor to carry out Colonel Lockett's
plan of throwing his lines around the
enemy and thus cutting off retreat.
The nature of the mountainous country
made it impracticable to execute this
movement successfully. After the insur-
gents began to rua there was a vain at-
tempt to use artillery.
Manila, December 31.-Colonel Lockett
has had a second engagement with the

from their position. Only one American
officer and five soldiers were wounded, but
the loss of the insurgents was heavy.

How To Use Coffee Without Its
Hurting You.
The aromatic oil and Tannic acid in
coffee is what disagrees with the stom-
ach and produces nervousness. These ob-
jectionable ingredients only give fiavor
to the coffee and have nothing to do with
its stimulating and exhilarating effect.
Grove's Concentrated Coffee Tablets
contain in a concentrated form all the ac-
tive principles of coffee without the two
objectionable ingredients which irritate
the stomach thus producing Sour Stom-
ach, Dyspepsia and Nervousness. Use
these tablets in place of coffee and these
troubles will disappear.
Belleving that when tried every coffee
and tea drinker will not only continue to
use these tablets, but will recommend
them to their friends, we have decided
to introduce them by sending for 30 days.

cities instead of letters. Letter A is number 1, B
number 2, C number 3, etc., throughout the entire
alphabet. IF YOU CAN SPELL OUT
THESE THREE CITIES YOU MAY
