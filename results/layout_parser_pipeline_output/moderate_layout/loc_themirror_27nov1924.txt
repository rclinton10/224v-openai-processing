HANKSGIVING Day did not
originate in the United States,
but days of thanks have been
set aside for some special pur-
poses, many centuries ago.
Days for giving thanks were
known to the Israelites and are
mentioned many times in the Bible. Also
were not uncommon in England before
the Reformation and among the Protestants
afterwards.
OUR MOTTO-"IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND."
Stillwater, Minnesota, Thursday, November 27, 1924
and two souls, crowded together in log
houses behind the tall stockades, feeling
safe only in their nearness to each other.
The first Thanksgiving feast, held in
the fall of 1621 was not made know by a
formal proclamation. The colony was too
small to need such a notice, but the cir-
cumstances under which the celebration
was held are told in Governor Bradford's
history in a way well worthy of quota-
tion:
"They (the colonists) began now to
gather in the small harvest they had, and
to fitte up their houses and dwellings
against winter, beeing all well recovered
in health and strength, and had all things
in good plenty: for as some where thus
employed in affairs abroad, others where
exercised in fishing aboute codd, and bass,
and other fish, of which they tooke good
store, of which
every family had
their portion . . .
And now begane
to come in store
of foule, as win-
ter approached, of
which this place
did abound when
they came first,
but afterwarts de-
creased by de-
grees. And be-
sides water foule,
there was great
store of wild
Turkies, of which
they took many,
besides vension,
The first Thanksgiving Day held in
North America was conducted by an Eng-
lish minister by name of Wolfall, in 1578
on the shores of Newfoundland. The
paster accompanied the expedition under
Frobisher, who brought the first English
colony to settle on those shores. The
earliest record of any observance of a
similar kind, within the present territory 1 etc. Besides they
of the United States, was held by the
Popham colony, settled at Lagadahoc, on
the coast of Maine, in August, 1607.
But the real origin of Thanksgiving, as
a day set aside for the purpose of prayer
and rejoicing must be attributed to Gover-
nor Bradford of Massachusetts. Those
early settlers had been such absolute
Christians, that they could not even bear
any suggestion of an earlier creed. They
objected to Christmas as "heathenish" just
because it contained-as it still contains-
too many relics of pre-Christian days.
Having done so, they turned right around
and picked the most thorough pagan of all
celebrations, that of the gathered harvest,
and made out of it an institution, that
has grown and spread for three-hundred
They went back to a festival,
which has been held ever since man began
to plant and gather crops; but they made
of it something more modern, Christian,
and at the last-American. They gave a
religious character to a celebration, which
for ages has been one of purely material
jollification and made it a part of the
community's public policy, which three
hundred years of changes and develop-
ments in this country, have not been able
to change.
years.
That little band of self-exiled, de-
voted Christians, crossed the stormy sea
in the Mayflower and landed at Plymouth
Rock on December 21, 1620. Their first
winter in the New World was one of
great suffering, marked with famine and
hardship, and it was in 1621, the fall fol-
lowing the landing at Plymouth, that the
Pilgrims celebrated their first Thanksgiv-
ing Day.
Back from the rocky coastline of Mas-
sachusetts, a little colony of one hundred
had about a peck
a meale a weeke
to
a person, or
now, since har-
vest, Indean corne
to that proportion.
Which made
many afterwards
write so largely
of their plenty
whole little colony, in its best buckled
shoes and high hats, with blunder-busses
across square shoulders, sallied forth from
the stockaded homes through snow to the
little log church, there to give thanks for
the freedom of their stern lifes.
Outside, the Indians crouched behind
fir and beeches, watching and wondering,
and slowly began to understand that there
was room for them and for the pale-face,
too.
-Twelve years later, the colony had
grown so much already, that a formal
proclamation seemed necessary. The first
one was issued on October 1, 1633, and the
Thanksgiving celebration was held two
weeks later, October 16th. Connecticut ap-
pointed a day in 1639, and annually after
1647, except 1675. The Dutch in New
Netherland, set aside a day in 1644 and
November Coat of Arms
November has a coat of arms
No king's could grander be;
It beats the finest specimens
Of ancient heraldry.
Upon a shield of pumpkin pie
In hues of brown and gold
Are lozenges of cranberry sauce
And chicken casseroled.
A roasted turkey couchant on
A table there is seen,
With quarterings of potatoes mashed,
And celery white and green.
And apples red, and pretty girls
The flour for crullers sieving,
And at the top the legend scrolled
In letters bold "Thanksgiving."
here to their friends in England which
where not fained, but true reports."
Just imagine us modern folks boasting
about our plenty under the stimulus of a
"peck a meale a weeke to a person," plus
such game as could be trapped, or shot
with flint-lock firearms. But this is only
a point of view, but one thing is sure;
Governor Bradford and his brave com-
panions, did know more of the basic busi-
ness of living, then we do today.
Wonderful hearts had our Pilgrim
fathers and for steady, cheerful courage,
the Pilgrim colonists never have been sur-
passed.
Governor Bradford in his account of
the Pilgrim's first Thanksgiving, does not
give us a menu of the dinner but he often
refers to the wild turkeys as one of the
luxuries of the colony. However, John
Fosslyn, an English traveler and natura-
alist, who visited New England in 1638
and wrote an account of its "Rarities,"
says: Cranberry or bearberry (because
bears used much to feed upon them) is
a small trayling plant that grows in salt
marshes that are overgrown with moss.
The Indians and English use them much,
boiling them with sugar for sauce to eat
with their meat."
And so it was, that the first day of a
organized Thanksgiving was set. The

occasionally there-
after. During the
war of Indepen-
dence the Conti-
nental
congress
appointed one or
more Thanksgiv-
ing days each
year, except in
1777. Then, on
October 3, 1789,
the new President
of the new nation,
George Washing-
ton, set aside
Thursday, Nov.
26, 1789 as a day
of national thanks
and again in
1795 he called the
country together,
to give thanks,
among other
things. For the
signal and mani-
fold Mercies, and
the favorable In-
terposition of His
Providence in the
course and con-
clusion of the War . . . . for the peaceful
and rational manner in which we have
been enabled to establish constitutions and
governments for our safety and happyness."
Washington it might be deducted from
above was a nationalist, with no leaning
whatever towords state sovereignty, and
always ready to make his preferences
known, in prayer as well as in other
ways. An instance of this frankness oc-
curs in the above mentioned proclama-
tion, where he asks the people to pray
heaven, "To protect and guide all Sov-
ereigns and Nations, especiall such as
have shown kindness to us."
President Madison at the close of the
War of 1812, appointed a day to give
thanks.
In New York state from 1817 on, the
festival was annual.
In some of the southern states a na-
tional Thanksgiving day meet with strong
opposition as a "relic of Puritan bigotry,"
so utterly at variance with the "Cavalier
ideals" of the southern colonists but in 1858
proclamations were issued by the gov-
ernors of 25 states and two territories.
There is a wonderful inspirational side
to the day set aside through three hun-
dred years of American history, a day
expressive of a nation's gratitude in which
pessimism should have no place.

CHAPTER VIII (Continued)
RE you asking me to aid you in
finding the assassin of the man
whom we both knew as a
friend," went on Lee Fu Chang,
after rapping the clotty from
his pipe, "and, to a certain
extent, I may be able to do so,
but please do not look to me to take an
active part in your campaign, for I shall
be compelled to decline. As I said, it is
not a matter for the police. I need not
tell you gentlemen that they would be
helpless, even if they were to instigate
and carry out a genuine attempt to ap-
prehend the slayer of Gordon Malcolm.
I may say that I have no intimate knowl-
edge of the deed, its commission, or its
perpetrator. Had I been in possession of
the certain knowledge that he was to be
removed, I should have given him warn-
ing, not in person, but through some chan-
nel known to the two of us.
"However, being in constant touch with
the little world in which I live, I have
an inkling as to the slayer's identity, noth-
ing more, nothing definite. This I am not
at liberty to disclose to you. In the eyes
of the men who ordained Gordon Mal-
colm's death, if we are to accept surface
indications as overlying the real motive
for the deed, it was not murder but just
retribution, and, from their viewpoint,
they are in the right. As for Occidentals,
they would not, and could not, understand
why the pilfering of an image from a
temple should be punishable by death.
But both of you gentlement are, to a cer-
cain extent, Easternized and you can un-
derstand that it was not so much robbery as
sacrilege. While I find myself unable to
place you upon the trail of the person
selected as the emmissary of retributive
justice by the guardians of the temple, I
can prevent you from losing valuable time
following a blind trail. Ask of me that,
I beg you, and respect my reasons for
reticence in other regards."
Lawrence put a question which had
been trembling upon his lips for several
moments to Lee Fu Chang. "Was it the
work af a Tong?"
The old man glanced at him briefly, and
his heavy eyelids flickered.
"Possibly," was his guarded answer.
Kent's first question was more to the
point. The gray-faced Celestial centered
his attention upon the in- (Page 2, Col. 2)
