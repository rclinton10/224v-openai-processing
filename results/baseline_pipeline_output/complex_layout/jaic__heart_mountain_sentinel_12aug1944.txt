However, most of the so-called

retrospect except for one major
point — restoration of full civil
rights for nisei and equal treatment
for our loyal alien parents, who
hope desperately to make this na-
tion their permanent home despite
the laws which prevent their be-
coming citizens.
The one major problem remain-

Faith in the “American way of
life” still is undoubtedly the strong-
est feeling the majority of us have.

In two years that sometime feel
like a lifetime and at other times
seem to have gone swiftly, Heart
Mountain has been transformed
from a wire-barricaded compound
with glaring fingers of searchlights
haunting the night to a more-or-
less typical community.
