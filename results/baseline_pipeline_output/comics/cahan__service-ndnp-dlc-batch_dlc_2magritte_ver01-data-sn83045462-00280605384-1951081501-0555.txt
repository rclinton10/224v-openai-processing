. South said later that he would
have bid a grand slam if North
had been able to show three kings
Gver the Blackwood five-no-trump|
call. It was unfortunate, however,
that South did not do better with
the excellent material in hand, at
the excellent contract.

West led the club jack. Win-
ning with the blank ace, South
drew trumps in two rounds, then
eashed the ace of diamonds. When
West. showed out, declarer said dis-
gustedly, “What a break! Now we)
need the spade finesse, partner.” |
Forthwith, he took that finesse, and
his disgust was doubled and re-
doubled when East smothered the |
spade queen and laid down the
king of clubs. Down one!

As we said originally, the hand
eould have been made in several
ways, but some of these would in-}
volve the use of complicated ase
plays. The really simple way—so!|
simple that South should have been
ashamed to miss it—was to pro-

drawing trumps and cashing a high
diamond, but, with the diamond

when East covered with the king,
