South said later that he would
have bid a grand slam if North
had been able to show three kings
over the Blackwood five-no-trump
call. It was unfortunate, however,
that South did not do better with
the excellent material in hand, at
the excellent contract.
West led the club jack. Win-
ning with the blank ace, South
drew trumps in two rounds, then
cashed the ace of diamonds. When
West showed out, declarer said dis-
gustedly, "What a break! Now we
need the spade finesse, partner."
Forthwith, he took that finesse, and
his disgust was doubled and re-
doubled when East smothered the
spade queen and laid down the
king of clubs. Down one!
As we said originally, the hand
could have been made in several

to make a return lead? A diamond
return by East would go up to
dummy's tenace of K-10-6; a spade
return would give dummy two
tricks in the suit, and a club return
would let South discard his last
loser while ruffing in dummy.

While subscribing to the belief that strong emotions should

children find acceptable ways of doing so.
Human beings have two eyes, the
same as foxes, squirrels, rabbits,
wolves, bears and other furry ani-
mals. Reptiles, fish and birds also
are two-eyed.
The two-eyed rule spreads far and
wide through the animal kingdom,
but it is broken by many kinds of
insects. If insects had noses, we
up their noses at the idea of having
only two eyes apiece!
It is common for insects to have
four or five eyes! Two or three of
pass through color cells before they
reach nerves. The nerves carry the
"message" of what is seen to the
insect brain.

pound eye differs, according to the
kind of insect. Certain ants have

might expect many of them to turn "PROBOSCIS"
The eye of a housefly has about
4,000 facets. That is a great number,
but some insects are far ahead of
the
housefly.
The swallowtail
butterfly, for example, has 17,000
facets in each eye. Above the
swallowtail is the convolvulus hawk
moth. This moth has 27,000 facets
in each compound eye!
