London, January 1 .- In the absence of
confirmation of the reported sortie from
Ladysmith, that story is discredited. No
such hopeful view can be taken as the
Boer account of the Mafeking sortie

it seems, has been one of the principal
staples bought for the purpose and was

picion. The British authorities, however,
appear to have been possessed of more
or less information on the subject for
some time, but have been powerless to

The news of the spread of a rebellion
among the Dutch colonists and of the
attempts of Boers to cut the railway at
widely different points is very disquieting
as bearing upon the safety of the ex-
tended lines of communication.
All the correspondents are beginning to
hint at a forward movement on the part
of General Buller, the danger of which
is indicated in a dispatelr to The Daily
Telegraph from Frere recording the un-
fortunate failure of two reconnaissances.
In one case the Boer lines at Colenso
were to have been bombarded by night.
Mounted men drew the Boer fire, and it
was intentled that the naval guns should
bombard. This, however, the latter fall

compelled to flounder back to camp

discomfort.

tention was to cross the river into Mexico
and operate from that side of the line.
His purpose might not have been disclos-
ed had he not got into a dispute with
an Englishman and been shot at several
times.
He went to a firm of lawyers,
Turney & Burgess, and engaged them to

SANTA ANA ATTACKS SUBIG.
Washington, December 26 .- The war
department is in receipt of official dis-
patches from Manila which state that
General Santa Ana, with a force of in-
surgents estimated at 300, attacked the
funeral.
Today it developed that the plot in-
cluded the throwing of bombs among
the foreign consuls attending the ceremo-
ny in order to bring about international
complications.
These, it seems, were
to be thrown from the Escolta's high-
est building, but the avoidance of the
Escolta by the funeral procession spoiled
the plan.
Aguinaldo's Presence Asserted.
The populace, it Is thought, had been
prepared for the attempt by a rumor
circulated widely among the natives yes-
terday that Aguinaldo was in Manila and
would personally lead the outbreak. The
American authorities having been advised
of what was brewing, prepared for all
contingencies.
Captain Morrison, who commands the
troops in the most turbulent district of
the city, says he does not believe an
actual uprising will ever occur, as the
natives lack the resolution to take the
first steps in a movement that would en-

cents-a moderate price-would give $120

Twenty dollars per acre he considers a
liberal allowance for all expenses, leav-
ing $100 per acre net
re net profit, which spells
prosperity, while 5 and 6-cent cotton
means ruin. His articles show that the
saccharine coefficient of south Georgia
cane is much larger than that of Louis-
fana, and he accounts for this by stating
that Louisiana cane is grown on low,
marshy land, where an excess of mois-
ture is taken up in growth. His investi-
gations have shown that south Florida
cane is richer in saccharine matter than
any known, three gallons of juice yield-
ing one gallon of sirup of standard densi-
ty; the cane of this portion of the state
runs about six gallons of juice to one of
sirup. He says that he has some mush
sugar, of which he expects to carry a sam-
ple on his next trip to Savannah to show
the sugar men what it is like. This mush
sugar is richer in saccharine matter than
any other form of crude sugar, and its

Montejo's
Defense
Before
Court-
martial.
Chicago, December 31 .- The Tribune to-
day prints the text of Admiral Montejo's
defense under courtmartial proceedings
for his defeat at Manila. The bulk of
the blame is charged by the admiral not
to himself or his fleet, but to the Spanish
government for its unprepared condition.
He also claims that Admiral Dewey kept
out of range of the Spanish guns -- a pro-
ceeding which Montejo refers to as "a
retreat." Montejo says:
"The only preparation that had been
made for war was made by the Ameri-
cans, who were business and arranged
everything with pencil and paper.
The
Initial velocity of our cannon was 51
meters; that of the smallest cannon of
our enemies was 760 meters.
Admiral
Dewey, with pencil in hand, noted the
thickness of his mantlets and casements,
and knew what energy was required to
penetrate them. He also knew exactly
the weight of the most powerful projec-
tile of our ships, and by a simple mathe-
matical calculation he arrived at the dis-
tance at which he could fight without
himself receiving any harm.
Thus he
ascertained that he could light at a dis-
tance of 2,000 or 3,000 meters with abso-
luto impnuity.
The situation, therefore,
was just this:
We were vulnerable t
all the projectiles of the enemy, and this
the enemy well knew, while he got out
of reach of our cannon and remained out
of reach all the while."
Admiral Montejo adds:
"In order to give an idea of our mis-
erable situation I may mention that we
had only fourteen torpedoes for the de
fense of 2,000 meters of space and that
the cable, which we obtained in Hong
Kong, was only long enough for five tor-
pedoes and, therefore, only five torpedoes
could be placed."

marines were sent from Olongapo to re-
enforce the garrison, and the Filipinos
were driven back, several being killed.
There were no casualties on the American
side.
A company of the Forty-sixth volunteer
Infantry, together with a contingent of
marines, has been sent from Manila to
re-enforce the Subig garrison still further.

A THOUSAND REBELS ROUTED.
Manila, December 27 .- Colonel Lockett,
with a force of 2,500, including artillery,
attacked this morning a strong force
of insurgents entrenched in the moun-
tains near Montalbon, about five miles
northeast of San Mateo. The enemy was
completely routed, the Americans pur-
suing them through the hills, amid which
they fled in every direction.
Four Americans were wounded.
The
Filipinos' loss was large, resulting from
a heavy infantry and artillery fire for
three hours into the trenches.
It is supposed that the insurgents were
those who were driven out of San Mateo
on the day General Lawton was killed.
They numbered probably a thousand.
A dozen lines of insurgent trenches cov-
ered the steep trail through the hills and
likewise the valley below, along which
the Americans passed. The main attack-
Ing party consisted of the Forty-sixth
volunteer infantry, a troop of cavalry
and artillery, Colonel Lockett command-
ing in person.
The rest of the command
operated from remote points in an en-
deavor to carry out Colonel Lockett's
plan of throwing his lines around the
enemy and thus cutting off retreat.
The nature of the mountainous country
made it impracticable to execute this
movement successfully.
After the insur-
gents began to run there was a vain at-
tempt to use artillery.
FILIPINOS
TURNED
BANDITS.
Manila. December 29, 10:10 p. m .- The in-
surgents who evacuated the coast towns
between Dagupan and Vigan, fleeing to
the mountains before the advancing
Americans, are returning in small bands
to the towns the Americans do not occu-
py, terrorizing the natives and Chinamen
who showed friendship for the Ameri-
cans. The natives and Chinese are seeking
the protection of the American garrisons.
Colonel Wessel's cavalry, while scout-
tail fighting at close quarters with the
American troops.
An American advance in Cavite prov-
ince, south of Manila, is expected short-
ly. Reliable reports from native spies
show that there are upward of 2,000 or-
ganized insurgents' amder arms within a
mile of Imus. They are strengthening
their intrenchments and possess artillery.
Filipinos Well Intrenched.
At Novaleta, the Filipino Intrench-
ments have been much strengthened since
General Schwan's advance. A thousand
of the enemy are in the vicinity and there
are 600 at San Francisco de Malabon.
From twelve to a hundred garrison all
the towns in the southern part of Cavite
province and the same may be said of the
towns in Batangas province,
The provinces of North Camarines and
South Camarines hold quantities of hemp
which the people cannot market. As a
consequence the population in that part
of Luzon is suffering from lack of food
Rice now costs four times its normal
price.
It is estimated that 1,000 insurgents are
intrenched at Calamoa.
Reports have been received that 2,000
insurgents are massed at Mount Arayatt,
prepared to roll bowlders down upon ad-
vancing troops.
Country Roads Patrolled.
Life along the coast of the provinces
of Cagahan and north and south Ilocos
is resuming normal condition. The Amer
ican troops occupy the important towns
and patrol the country roads. The na-
tives implore the Americans to continue
the occupation, to establish a settled
government and to terminate the uncer-
tainty, abuses and confiscations that
have characterized the rule of the Tagall
revolutionists during the last eighteen
months. Vast amounts of tobacco, esti-
mated to be worth $2,000,000, are ready
for shipment to Manila. The opening of
the ports of Dagupan, San Fernando,
Vigan, Laoag and Aparri tomorrow will
permit the resumption of trade, bringing
relief to communities greatly in need
of foodstuffs. Many vessels have already
been cleared from Banila for these ports.
Spanish
prisoners declar
that Aguinaldo has ordered the release
of all Spaniards now in possession of the
rebels. The mountain passes of Cayagan
and the two Ilocos prov
s proviiges are still
guarded, in the hope of catching the in-
surgent general. Tinio, who is still a
Migitive. It is asserted that Lieutenant
Gilmore is in Tinto's custody.
How To
Use Coffee Without Its
Hurting You.
The aromatic oil and Tannic acid in
coffee is what disagrees with the stom-
ach and produces nervousness. These ob-
jectionable ingredients only give flavor
to the coffee and have nothing to do with
its stimulating and exhilarating effect.
Grove's Concentrated Coffee Tablets
contain in a concentrated form all the ac-
tive principles of coffee without the two
objectionable ingredients which irritate
the stomach thus producing Sour Stom-
ach, Dyspepsia and Nervousness.
Use
these tablets in place of coffee and these
troubles will disappear
Believing that when tried every coffee
and tea drinker will not only continue to
use these tablets, but will recommend
them to their friends, we have decided
by sending for 30 days
to introduce them by sen
a 25c package free by mail to any one
who will write for them.

Purchased Valuable Mineral Lands.
December 27 .- (Spe
Knoxville, Tenn.,
cial.)-A party of Ohio and Pennsylvania
capitalists, headed by John Hammond,
of Philadelphia, today purchased 3,30€
acres of oil and mineral and timber lands,
near Allegheny, in the mountains of east
Tennessee.
The property will be devel-
oped and oil wells will be sunk.
It is
rich in ofl, although it has never been
developed.
It is not given out how much
make a good quality of white sugar with
only a very slight brown sugar taste.
The sirup was boiled until it "blubbered"
all over, showing that it had reached the
point of crystallization, when a certain
amount of fresh well water was added.
This caused a second scum to rise, which
when skimmed off left a perfectly pure
saccharine solution, and this gave a white
sugar. He afterwards learned that the
loaf sugar in universal use forty years
ago was made in precisely the same man-
ner. He asserted that this was not caus-
ed by lime or other mineral properties of
the water acting as a clarifying agent,
as he had used rain water with the same
success.
As to the future of the melon growing
industry, once a remunerative one for
south Georgia, he declared it is practical-
ly a thing of the past. With the state of
Texas one great melon field, and reaching
the great cities of the middle west on a
rate of from forty to fifty dollars per car
less than we can command, the industry
is doomed. This is borne out by .all in-
formation obtainable; very few
will be
planted in this section next
melons
having strong positions which command
steep and narrow trails, and that they arey
season.
The deep interest being shown in the
subject by northern capitalists as well as
by those of Savannah and other south
Georgia towns has greatly encouraged
the judge in his hopes for the develop-
ment of the sugar industry with its im-
mense possibilities for the state and the
south. One piece of advice he gave in a
local paper some months ago has been
adopted pretty generally, and has proved
of great benefit; it was that the juice as
it came from the mill should be strained
through a filter of gray moss, which
takes out solid partieles and clarifie
leles and clarifies it.

EGAN TALKS OF DAIRY FARMS
VICE PRESIDENT OF CENTRAL
Book Is Intended to Place Before the
Farmer Valuable Information
in Accessible Shape.
Vice President J. M. Egan, of the Cen-
tral railway, has just published an in-
teresting pamphlet entitled "Facts for the
Farmers."
This pamphlet treats at length of the
dairy herd, its formation and manage-
ment; milk, with fifty dairy rules; hog
raising in the south; chickens, the kind
that should be raised; cotton seed and
Its products. The matter was obtained
largely from the government agricultural
department at Washington.
Mr. Egan is a great bellever in dairy-
ing as a source of profit to Georgia
farmers. For the past two or three years
he has been very much interested in de-
veloping dairies along the Central. In
the first article on "The Dairy Herd" It
is stated that the cattle must be good
and of the quality sulted to the work.
The farm should be specially adapted to
the branch of husbandry in view. A good
dairy farm is pretty certain to be a good
farm for other uses, but many good farms
in general are not suited to dairying. The
character of the accessible markets and
the means of communication should be
carefully studied.
The farmer need not seek far to find
the best kind of cows for milk or butter
1
making, or the best for the cream trade.
Dairymen are advised not to buy at once
a full stock of fullbred cattle of any

Gadsden, Ala .. December 29 .-- (Special.)-
Gus Lister, son of Sheriff Lister, was
shot in the hand this afternoon by Mrs.
Gus Davis. Lister and young Beachem
were disorderly and Mr. Davis broke a
chair over their heads and put them out
of his house and went after the police.
While he was absent, Lister and Beachem
returned to the house and cursed and
slapped Mrs. Davis, whereupon she shot
Lister with a 38-Smith & Wesson pistol.
All were arrested.
