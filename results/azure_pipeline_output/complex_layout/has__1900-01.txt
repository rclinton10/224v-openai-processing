SKAGWAY WOMEN.
NE of the most flattering incidents
of the reception given to the Amer-
ican members of the Joint High Com-
mission and United States Senators last
summer, in the large pavilion erected by
the Chamber of Commerce for the. fur-
pose, was their expressions of surprise
at the fashionable evening toilettes of
the Skagway women present. What is
more pleasing is the fact that the com-
pliment came from women of the leading
society of the United States, the wives
and friends of the distinguished visitors.
For it is true that a man is an unreliable
critic in such matters, and although the
softer sex "dress and array themselves
in all the modest pride that Art invents
aer beauty to improve," for the express
purpose of pleasing and attracting the
sternei sex, yet the latter sees only the
eneral effects, and never troubles him-
self as to how they are produced.
The compliment was as well-deserved
as it was flattering. With the prosperity
of the first winter in mind, the men who
had roughed it in bachelor dirt and dis-
order sent for their wives and families;
homes were built for them and other
families followed. Prosperity continu-
ing, the wives and grown daughters be-
gan to wear its outward and visible signs.

During the first year of Skagway's his-
tory nearly every man who remained the
major portion of that time had reaped a
success at least sufficiently large to justi-
fy him in sending for his family and mak-
ing this his permanent home. Homes in
numerable sprung up everywhere, in the
busy city and in its quiet suburbs, and
builders, carpenters, house painters and
paper hangers were soon reaping a rich
harvest. But they are not sufficient in
themselves to make a home. After the
house is completed it needs furniture to
make it a home. And so great was the de-
mand for furniture that E. R. Peoples felt
justified in starting a manufactory to meet
it. That his venture has proven a success
is substantially shown by the fact that his
business buildings now occupy such a
large piece of ground and that he is again
considering the advisability of enlarging

work, from the latest styles of drawing
room luxury to the more necessary kitchen
table.

the stimulation of this influence the ritual

chrysalis to one as beautiful in its teach-

no words said or things done in its Initi-
