DEMOCRACY.
BY JOHN G. WHITTIER.
" All things whatsoever ye would that men should
do unto you, do ve even so untothem .- MATT.vii.12.
Oh! fairest born of Love and Light,
Yet bending brow and eye severe
On all which pains The holy sight,
Or wounds the perfect car!
Beautiful yet thy temples rise,
Though there profaning gifts are throw√•.
And fires enkindled to the skies,
Are glaring on thy altar-stone.
Still sacred -- though thy name be breathetl
By those whose hearts thy truth deride ;
And garlands plucked from thee are wreathed
Around the haughty brow of Pride.
Oh! idol of my boyhood's time,
The faith in which my father stood,
E'en when the suns of Lust and crime
Had stained thy peaceful courts with blood.
Still to those courts my footsteps turn,
For through the mists that darken there,
I see the flames of Freedom burn,
The Kebla of the patriot's prayer.
The generous feeling, pure and warm,
Which owns the right of all divine,
The pitying heart- the helping arm-
The prompt self-sacrifice are thine.
Beneath thy broad, impartial eye,
How fade the lines of taste and birth!
How equal in their sufferings lie
The groaning multitudes of earth!
Still to a stricken brother true,
Whatever clime hath nurtured him,
As stooped to heal the wounded Jew
The worshipper of Gerizim.
By misery unepelled, unawed
By pomp or power, thou seest a MAN
In prince or peasant-slave or lord-
Pale priest or swarthy artisan.
Through all disguise, form, place, or name,
Beneath the flaunting robes of sin,
Through poverty and squalid shame,
Thou lookest on the man within ;
. On man, as man, retaining yet,
Howe'er deb ised, and soiled, and dim,
The crown upon his forehead set-
The immortal gift of God to him.
And there is reverence in thy look ;
For that frail form which mortals wear
The spirit of the Holiest took,
And veiled his perfect brightness there.
Not from the poor and shallow fount
Of vain philosophy thou art ;
He who of old on Syria's mount
Thrilled, warmed by turns the listener's heart.

JDE'S Patent Wheel Cultivator and Wire Grass

that Letters Patent have been taken out by the Sub-
scriber for his recent great improvements in the con-
struction and manufacture of FIELD CULTIVATORS;
an improvement so great as to entirely revolutionize
the whole system of farming, by reducing the expense
one-half or more. Wherever they have been intro-
duced, they have met the decided approbation of
armers, as the following certificates from the intel-
igent and practical farmers whose names are
ttached, abundantly show :
" Whether all the anticipations of Mr. Spooner
would be realized by the full adoption of his theory,
we do not here stop to enquire ; but we heartily com-
mend his endeavor to the notice of all who love a

of sect or party. Asa judicial writer, he has a depth

generally esteemed by his neighbors,

to do in the world. Like many Lond-

from the country. He had come up to
town when a poor lad to push his for-

distant relation, he had been able to
get into business on his own account,

Her dress was plain,

Who, when great trials come,
Nor seeks, nor shuns them, but doth calmly stay
Till he the thing and the example weigh ;
All being brought into a sum,
What place or person calls for he doth pay:
Whom none can work or woo
To use in anything a trick or sleight,
For, above all things, he abhors deceit,
His words, and works, and fashion too,
All of a piece, and all are clear and straight :
Who never melts or thaws
At close temptations ; when the day is done,
His goodness sets not, but in dark can run ;
l'he sun to others writeth laws,
And is their virtue; virtue is his sun:
Who, when he is to treat
With sick folks, fickle, those whom passions sway,
Allows f r that, and keeps his constaut way ;
Whom others' faults do not defeat,
But though men fail him, yet his part doth play
Whom nothing can procure,
When the wide world runs bias, from his will
To writhe his limbs, and share, not mend the ill.
This is the marksman firm aud sure,
Who still is right, and prays to be so still.

EARLY COPIES.
A late arrangement with the British publishers of
Black wood's Magazine secures to us early sheets of
that work, by which we shall be able to place the
entire number in the hands of subscribers before any
portion of it can be reprinted in any of the American
Journals. For this and other advantages secured to
our subscribers we pay so large a consideration, that
we may be compelled to raise the price of the Maga-
zine. Therefore we repeat " subscribe early while
the price is low.
