About four weeks ago she noticed that
Rath was spending most of his time in his
workshop, which adjoins a goose house
owned by the Hilsenbecks, and through
two knot holes a view of the interior of the
shop can be obtained. One afternoon Polly
was heard to say: "Shall we fix them

beck vigilant. On May 22 she saw Rath
enter the workshop with Polly on his shoul-

witnesses to what he was doing. Accord- Accord- On the charge of accepting a bribe of $15,
Captain Frederick W. Martelas, of the East
Thirty-fifth Street Police Station, was
placed on trial before Commissioner Roose-
velt, at Police Headquarters, yesterday
morning. The Parkhurst Society was in-
strumental in pushing t'he charge against
Martens, which dates back to 1891, when
he was a sergeant in the Tremont Station.
It is alleged that he designated Moses P.
Hamilton's store, at No. 1955 West Farms
road, in the Thirty-fourth Election District
of the Twenty-fourth Assembly District,
as a favorable polling place, for which he,
demanded $15. Lawyer Frank Moss acted ingly she sent for two young ladies who
live near by-the Misses Haller and Skin-

tered the goose house and claim that they
saw Rath working upon a hollow tube of
wood. They further allege that they saw
him drive a number of nails into this tube,
pour a black powdered substance into it,
and then affix cotton in either end. Occa-
sionally, however, Polly would make some yer Frank Moss acted
as prosecuting attorney, while Friend &
