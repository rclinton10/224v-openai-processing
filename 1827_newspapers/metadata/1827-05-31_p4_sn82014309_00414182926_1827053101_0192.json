He made long pause. He attempted to speak what he had prepared: but the venerable grey-haired pastor was unable to utter word. He covered his face with his hands, and wept with his weeping audience. He dried up his tears, and once more raised himself up to pro- nounce the euogy. Again his voice was stiffled. He bowed down and wept for several minutes. A third time the aged pastor of Linlithgow attempted to pay the last tribute to one whom he loved as his own soul. But he burst again into tears, & wept aloud. The whole audience melted into tears aud the most of them sobbed and wept. And after long silence, inter- rupted by sighs and groans,the clerk named the 18th verse of the 1I9th Psalm, Scottish version.) !\" Dear in Gods sight is his saints death, &c. And the mournful mel ody of \"Old Martyrs\" foated from the lips of two thousand weeping people. It was without atfectation, and without design. And it was one ofthe most touching, and eloquent perorations, perhaps, which ever closed funeral sermon over departed pei ty and worth.\"",

            "raw_text": "REMARKABLE CRIMINAL.\n\n Green was born of poor parents, and had little or no means of education. He was oftall stature, very great bodily strength, of surprising ingenuity, and of undaunted courage. At very early age he commen- ced the business of poacher, tempted on the one hand by his wants, and on the oth- CT, by the \"wages of iniquity''-the price offered for game, the abundance in his neighborhood, and the facility of taking, and disposing of it without detection. By snaring, which for some time he prac- tised with success, eluding the vigilance of tL\" gamekeepcrs by his activity and skill, he acquired sufficient means to provide him self with gun. This gun was soon after wards heard at night in one of the woods near Gunton. One of the principal keep CTS instantly proceeded to the spot, as usu- al, for the purpose of reconnoitering' the enemy, and finding only one man, he did not summon his assistantS, but advanced upon Green alone. As it happened, in this keeper Green found man of equal prowess, and of maturer nerve, which may be easily immagined, when the fact is sta- ted, that some years afterwards (at the age of 65) this same keeper, in single com bat, which lasted nearly an hour with a very desperate character, and powerful man, only half his own age, finally over powered his antagonist, and made him prisoner. A similar fate attended Green. He was taken with his gun and pheas- ant in his possession, and committed for short term ofimprisonment, of in the house of Correction at Aylesham. There he remained very few days, before his in- genuity suggested some means of escape, of which he avaied himself but he was very soon retaken, and he remained in safe confinement till the term expi- red. The conflict which he maintain ed so manfully with a veteran, and the circumstance of his breaking prison, rem dered him in some degree notorious and and it is to be presumed that he did not afterwards find it easy to gain employment. Heassociated with other idle and dissolute persons and whether he resumed his halo its of poaching or not, he committed a. mother offence, viz,-thst of breaking open watch-maker's shop. He was tried for the burglary, convicted, and condemned to he hanged, but the sentence was commuted for transportation. While he was await ing the executution of his sentence, he twice made his escape from the Castle of Norwich. He effected it the first time in the following extraordinary man. ncr.\n\n Between his apprehension and commit ment, he contrived to have an iron skew CT tied up within tail which he had worn similar to those still frequently worn by sailors. With this skewer he picked a a hole through thu. wall of his cell, which was one of those furtherest from the groundin this lofty building. The hole four feet below the roof of the castle, and as am informed by MT. Johnson, the pre- sent keeper of that prison, from his own observation, the size of the aperture meas- ured only l2 inches by 9. He cut his bed- ding into shreds, and bound them round his body. He was then heavily ironed, yet he crept through this small space and contrived to reach the roof four feet above him, probably, as it is supposed, pulling himself up to it by means. of one of the shreds of the bedding, which he musthavo previously thrown round one of the bat dement's upon the edge oft the roof. This place of egress was immed :ately over paved courtyard {: and, to use the keep CTS own words, from whom I received the account, had Green missed stays, he must have fallen upon the pavement, and have been dashed to pieces. Having tra- versed the roof to the opposite side of the castle, he lowered himself down to the ground he had then to climb over some very shigh railing, covered with tenter hooks 1; but he escaped, and finally found his way to comrade in the city of Nor wich, as it has been believed, who filed off his irons thus he was set at complete lib- erty. Whether he was re-taken or not before he had Committed fresh offence,I do not remember; but he was certainly a. gain in Norwich castle about two years af- terwards, and again escaped. The second escape was effected by means of key with which another prisoner had been fur nished. On this occasion, he relieved himself from his irons by the good luck, as he termed it, of finding the back spring of knife in his cell, or in the airing yard ,and of this he contrived to make saw. Hav- ing once more reached the part of the roof of the castle, by the help of rope made as before of ssme shreds of his blanket, he lowered himself down upon the roof of the",

A third time the aged pastor of Linlithgow attempted to pay the last tribute to one whom he loved as his own soul. But he burst again into tears, & wept aloud.

            "article": "REMARKABLE CRIMINAL.\n\n Green was born of poor parents, and had little or no means of education. He was oftall stature, very great bodily strength, of surprising ingenuity, and of undaunted courage. At very early age he commen- ced the business of poacher, tempted on the one hand by his wants, and on the oth- CT, by the \"wages of iniquity''-the price offered for game, the abundance in his neighborhood, and the facility of taking, and disposing of it without detection. By snaring, which for some time he prac- tised with success, eluding the vigilance of tL\" gamekeepcrs by his activity and skill, he acquired sufficient means to provide him self with gun. This gun was soon after wards heard at night in one of the woods near Gunton. One of the principal keep CTS instantly proceeded to the spot, as usu- al, for the purpose of reconnoitering' the enemy, and finding only one man, he did not summon his assistantS, but advanced upon Green alone. As it happened, in this keeper Green found man of equal prowess, and of maturer nerve, which may be easily immagined, when the fact is sta- ted, that some years afterwards (at the age of 65) this same keeper, in single com bat, which lasted nearly an hour with a very desperate character, and powerful man, only half his own age, finally over powered his antagonist, and made him prisoner. A similar fate attended Green. He was taken with his gun and pheas- ant in his possession, and committed for short term ofimprisonment, of in the house of Correction at Aylesham. There he remained very few days, before his in- genuity suggested some means of escape, of which he avaied himself but he was very soon retaken, and he remained in safe confinement till the term expi- red. The conflict which he maintain ed so manfully with a veteran, and the circumstance of his breaking prison, rem dered him in some degree notorious and and it is to be presumed that he did not afterwards find it easy to gain employment. Heassociated with other idle and dissolute persons and whether he resumed his halo its of poaching or not, he committed a. mother offence, viz,-thst of breaking open watch-maker's shop. He was tried for the burglary, convicted, and condemned to he hanged, but the sentence was commuted for transportation. While he was await ing the executution of his sentence, he twice made his escape from the Castle of Norwich. He effected it the first time in the following extraordinary man. ncr.\n\n Between his apprehension and commit ment, he contrived to have an iron skew CT tied up within tail which he had worn similar to those still frequently worn by sailors. With this skewer he picked a a hole through thu. wall of his cell, which was one of those furtherest from the groundin this lofty building. The hole four feet below the roof of the castle, and as am informed by MT. Johnson, the pre- sent keeper of that prison, from his own observation, the size of the aperture meas- ured only l2 inches by 9. He cut his bed- ding into shreds, and bound them round his body. He was then heavily ironed, yet he crept through this small space and contrived to reach the roof four feet above him, probably, as it is supposed, pulling himself up to it by means. of one of the shreds of the bedding, which he musthavo previously thrown round one of the bat dement's upon the edge oft the roof. This place of egress was immed :ately over paved courtyard {: and, to use the keep CTS own words, from whom I received the account, had Green missed stays, he must have fallen upon the pavement, and have been dashed to pieces. Having tra- versed the roof to the opposite side of the castle, he lowered himself down to the ground he had then to climb over some very shigh railing, covered with tenter hooks 1; but he escaped, and finally found his way to comrade in the city of Nor wich, as it has been believed, who filed off his irons thus he was set at complete lib- erty. Whether he was re-taken or not before he had Committed fresh offence,I do not remember; but he was certainly a. gain in Norwich castle about two years af- terwards, and again escaped. The second escape was effected by means of key with which another prisoner had been fur nished. On this occasion, he relieved himself from his irons by the good luck, as he termed it, of finding the back spring of knife in his cell, or in the airing yard ,and of this he contrived to make saw. Hav- ing once more reached the part of the roof of the castle, by the help of rope made as before of ssme shreds of his blanket, he lowered himself down upon the roof of the",

May 15.\n\n lmposter.-One day last week, person called on the editor of this paper, who had his right arm amputated at the shoulder, and solicited charity, as an unfortunate disabled member of the profession.-Said his name was Clark-that his parents re- sided in Burlington in this state-that he served his apprenticeship with MT. Hill, of Concord, N. H--that he lost his arm in December last, in Lancaster, Penn. by a swelling-that through the assistance of the Typographical Society of Philadel- phia, he obtained passage to Portsmouth N.

On ac- costing him and observing, that he must have lost his way, he coolly observed, that :\" he supposed he knew where he was,\" and immediately took himself off. We have since learned, that his stories rela- tive to himself are various, suited to the occasion-that at other places in the vil- lage he pretended to have been lieuten- ant in the battle Of Plattsblrgh, where he lost his arm, &c. He is evidently an im- poster and though unfortunate in the loss of a limb, is unworthy the charity of the community. inasmuch, as we have good evidence to- believe, it is sought mainly to gratity thirst for spirituous liquors. We feel it duty to give this informa- ton that the charitable in this vicinity, and the profession in particular, may not again be imposed on by his appeals to their sympathy and charity.",
