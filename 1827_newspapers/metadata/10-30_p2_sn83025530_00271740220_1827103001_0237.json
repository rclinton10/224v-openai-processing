Louallier with mutny or f\nexciting muny. with being spy, sc. &c. NJ Il\nLouallier has recently published history of the Ii\ntransaction which has given rise to the following az\ntice. 1t seems that he inserted an article in al 8\nnewspaper on the Sd of March, 1915 complaining i\nof an order of General Jacksons commanding the\nFrenchmen residing in New Orleans to leave that\nplace in three days, and to keep themselves at a\ndistance Of 100 miles from the city. For this he\nwas arrested, and imprisoned !; and then broughtl\nbefore court martial, to answer to no less than\nseven charges above mentioned, all arising out OF\nthe article thus published. After denying the juris\ndction and authority of the court martial, and be-\ning overruled, he suffered the to 60 with\nout calling witness, or making any defence.\nHe was however acquitted. General jackson\nhsapproved of the sentence of course and gave\nhis reasons. As soon as Mr.. Louaier was ar\nrested, he applied to judge Hail. of the district\nCourt OF the United States, for Habeas Cor\nPms which in his case, from Judge Lewis--a\nJudge under the state authority--for procuring\nwhich the attorney was arrested, and an order\nissued by General Jackson for arrestlng Judge Lew\nis for granting the Hlbea: Corpus in favor OF Judge\nHail. Here then we're three arrests and an order\nfor fourth under the authority of General Jack\nson, in the proceedings relating to which, the rights\nand security OF the several individuals were totally\ndsregarted. and the authority and sanctty of the\ncivil laws utterly despised, and tramped under foot\n1t must be acknowledged that strong necessity mus\nhave existed to justify such outrageous proceedings\nWe will endeayor to ascertain the facts respecting\nit.\n\n\nThe battle of New Orleans it will be recolect\ned, happened on the 9Th of January, 1915.

In this state Of things, would seem, an\nin cons equence Of the uneasness felt and expressed\nGeneral Jackson issued his perGmptory order II\nthe removal of the Frenchmen in the city, to tn\ndistance Of 100 miles in the country. That the\nshould have been uneasy, is not strange not mere\nbecause they were unnecessarily and arbitrarily ke\nfrom their families and homes but they were pr\nbably appreheusive of the effects Of their exposu\nto the most destructive Diseases 1t is stated in\nof the documents accompanying Mr.. Louaers a\ncount, that the troops from Kentucky and Tennc\nwere stationed upon plantations, and that in o,\nmonth no less than live hundred of them fell vi\nTins to diseases which originated among them.\n\n\nWhat makes Gen. 5ackson's condLct towards\nLouallier the more remarkable is, that tile public\nton which was the Of it, appeared, as is asst\nted by that gentleman, 43 days after Gen. Jacks\nhad left the field of battle, and returned to New {\nleans-43 days after the British had left Louisiana\nand % days after the last act Of hostility comm\nted by the British forces as their officers receiv\nintelligence Immediately afterwards that treaty\npeace had been signed in Dec. between the U Sta\nand Great Britain. 1t was also FL days after G\nLivingston had returned from the British fleet, q\ninformed Gen.
