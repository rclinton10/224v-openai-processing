            "raw_text": "The law and the facts which relate to the execu-\n\n\non of the six militiamen by order OF Gen, Jackson,\nafter their term Of service had expired, appear to\nbe imperfectly understood by some, and those who\nare employed to whitewash Gen. jackson have\ntaken advantage Of this effectiveness Of knowledge\nto involve the public mind in deeper mist Of err\non this subject. 1t is time that those outrages\non TRUTH and those abuses of public confidence, on\nthe part of those who rely Justification and mys\nterry for the attainment of their ends, should be met\nand corrected and that the people should be put\nin possession of simple and accurate statement Of\nthe whole Affair.\"\n\n\nFor the purpose of producing clear conception\nof the subject, we first of all quote the charge ITSELF\nas it is given in the report of the Nashville Commit\ntee, dated April 25, 1927. He is charged with\nhaving caused the execution of six mtiamen, Tor\ncrimes committed after their term of service had\nexpired.''\n\n\nThe conviction of the men for g ssmutiny'' and\n'' connivng at mutiny,'' by court martial compos-\ned of three regular members and two .upernumera-\nries, and their execution established by extracts\ncertified by Andrew J. Donnelson, /\" copied from\nthe original proceedings of the Court which he\nhad received from Col. Robert Butler. late Adju-\ntant General OF the Southern Division\" and by the\norder issued by command of Gen. Jackson on the\n22d of January 1915, for the execution, four days\nafter its promu CATION at Mobile. Of those proceed\nings there trace the records of the War De-\npartment, (the only document filed there being the\ngeneral order above referred to,) although the fol-\nlowing clause in the Articles of War expressly pro-\nvdes that proceedings of courts martial shall be trans\nmtted to the Department for preservation\nart 80. Every judge Advocate or person Off\nciatng as such at any general court martial shall\ntransmit, with as much expedition the opportunl-\nty Of time and distance of place admit, the orr\nsinal proceedings and sentence of such court mar\ntial, to the Secretary of War, which said original\nproceedings and sentence shall be carefully kept\nand preserved in the office Of said Secretary to the\nend that the persons entitled thereto may me ena-\nbled, upon application 10 the said office, to obtain\ncopies thereof\"\n\n\n| Instead Of being thus transmitted, we find the\nproceedings in the hands Of Une Of the family Of\nGeneral Jackson, circumstance which at once\nproves the violation of the Article of War, and war;\nrants the inference that such violation was risked to\n\n\nreserve the character OF General Jackson from the\neffect of any future investigation.\n\n\nThe cruelty Of the act could only be met by pal\n\n\natlves, aud those have been pentitully, but very\nunsuccesstully, administered by the editors of the\nGeneral but the Megaluy of it mas been encoun-\ntered by direct denial. The editor of the rele-\ngraph at once hazarded the declaration that the\ni Tennessee militia were mustered into service for\nsix months.'' In reply to this the Democratic\nPress refers the editor Of the Telegraph to the War\nDepartment for evidence that Gov. Blount made\napplication to Mr.. Madison that the term of the mi\nlitia service 'sshould not exceed three months.',\n; sc. and that Mr.. Madison s'drected that they\n: should serve only that time\" The Democratic\n: Press has committed an error in making this cor-\nrespondence between Gov. Blount and MIR. Maa-\nson refer to the militia whose term of service expir\ned on the 10Th OF September. 1914. 1t had refer\nence to given period In order to test the legai-\n, ty OF the act, we proceed to statement of the\nvera laws relating to the militia when called into\nservice.\n\n\n: The law which provides for calling forth the\nb,ab I,n.,\n\n\ndate Feb %, 1895, and the 4th section of this law\n5 declares\n\n\n3 That no officer, on.commissoned officer, or\n, private, of the militia, shall be compelled to serve\n\n\nmore than three months after his arrival at the place\n\n\nOF rendezvous, in any one year, nor more than in\n\n\ndue rotation with every other able bodied man of the\nsame rank in the battalion to which he belongs.'\n: A law, temporary in its operation, and enacted\nfor special purpose, was passed on the 10th Of\nApril, 1912, authorizing ''a detachment from the\nmilitia of the United States.'' This law authoriz-\ned requistion upon the governors of the several\nStates, for their respective proportions of hun\n\n\ndred thousand militia. officers included. The third\nD section of this act, which has been quoted by the\neditor of the Telegraph as the guide of the conduct\nof Gen. Jackson in Jan. 1915, runs thus\n\"And be it further enacted, that the said detach-\n\n\nment shall not be compelled to serve longer time\n\n\nthan six months after they arrive at the place Of\n\n\nrendezvous\"\n\n\nThe ninth section of the same act runs thus\n\n\nSec. 9. And be it further enacted, that this act\nshall continue and be in force for the term of too\n\n\ngears from The passing thereof and no onger''\n\n\nThe act consequently expired according to its\nown limitation the 10th of April, 1914. 1t was\nnever re-enacted, nor was provision similar to\nthat contained in the third section, and relied on by\nthe Telegraph to establish the legality of Gen.\nJackson's conduct, included in any subsequent law\n\n\nFrom the 10th to the 18th Of April, ,sl4. there\nl,,",

Robert Butler. late Adju-\ntant General OF the Southern Division\" and by the\norder issued by command of Gen. Jackson on the\n22d of January 1915, for the execution, four days\nafter its promu CATION at Mobile. Of those proceed\nings there trace the records of the War De-\npartment, (the only document filed there being the\ngeneral order above referred to,) although the fol-\nlowing clause in the Articles of War expressly pro-\nvdes that proceedings of courts martial shall be trans\nmtted to the Department for preservation\nart 80. Every judge Advocate or person Off\nciatng as such at any general court martial shall\ntransmit, with as much expedition the opportunl-\nty Of time and distance of place admit, the orr\nsinal proceedings and sentence of such court mar\ntial, to the Secretary of War, which said original\nproceedings and sentence shall be carefully kept\nand preserved in the office Of said Secretary to the\nend that the persons entitled thereto may me ena-\nbled, upon application 10 the said office, to obtain\ncopies thereof\"\n\n\n| Instead Of being thus transmitted, we find the\nproceedings in the hands Of Une Of the family Of\nGeneral Jackson, circumstance which at once\nproves the violation of the Article of War, and war;\nrants the inference that such violation was risked to\n\n\nreserve the character OF General Jackson from the\neffect of any future investigation.\n\n\nThe cruelty Of the act could only be met by pal\n\n\natlves, aud those have been pentitully, but very\nunsuccesstully, administered by the editors of the\nGeneral but the Megaluy of it mas been encoun-\ntered by direct denial. The editor of the rele-\ngraph at once hazarded the declaration that the\ni Tennessee militia were mustered into service for\nsix months.'' In reply to this the Democratic\nPress refers the editor Of the Telegraph to the War\nDepartment for evidence that Gov. Blount made\napplication to Mr.. Madison that the term of the mi\nlitia service 'sshould not exceed three months.',\n; sc. and that Mr.. Madison s'drected that they\n: should serve only that time\" The Democratic\n: Press has committed an error in making this cor-\nrespondence between Gov. Blount and MIR. Maa-\nson refer to the militia whose term of service expir\ned on the 10Th OF September. 1914. 1t had refer\nence to given period In order to test the legai-\n, ty OF the act, we proceed to statement of the\nvera laws relating to the militia when called into\nservice.\n\n\n: The law which provides for calling forth the\nb,ab I,n.,\n\n\ndate Feb %, 1895, and the 4th section of this law\n5 declares\n\n\n3 That no officer, on.commissoned officer, or\n, private, of the militia, shall be compelled to serve\n\n\nmore than three months after his arrival at the place\n\n\nOF rendezvous, in any one year, nor more than in\n\n\ndue rotation with every other able bodied man of the\nsame rank in the battalion to which he belongs.'\n: A law, temporary in its operation, and enacted\nfor special purpose, was passed on the 10th Of\nApril, 1912, authorizing ''a detachment from the\nmilitia of the United States.'' This law authoriz-\ned requistion upon the governors of the several\nStates, for their respective proportions of hun\n\n\ndred thousand militia. officers included. The third\nD section of this act, which has been quoted by the\neditor of the Telegraph as the guide of the conduct\nof Gen. Jackson in Jan. 1915, runs thus\n\"And be it further enacted, that the said detach-\n\n\nment shall not be compelled to serve longer time\n\n\nthan six months after they arrive at the place Of\n\n\nrendezvous\"\n\n\nThe ninth section of the same act runs thus\n\n\nSec. 9. And be it further enacted, that this act\nshall continue and be in force for the term of too\n\n\ngears from The passing thereof and no onger''\n\n\nThe act consequently expired according to its\nown limitation the 10th of April, 1914. 1t was\nnever re-enacted, nor was provision similar to\nthat contained in the third section, and relied on by\nthe Telegraph to establish the legality of Gen.\nJackson's conduct, included in any subsequent law\n\n\nFrom the 10th to the 18th Of April, ,sl4. there\nl,,",
