They arc reared by the Bedo-\nuins, in the northern deserts between Basso-\nra, Merdin, and the frontiers of Syria; and\nthough they are neither large nor beautiful,\ntheir race and hereditary qualities being the\nonly objects of estimation, the preservation\nof their breed is carefully and authentically\nwitnessed; and the offspring ofa Kochain\nstallion with an ignoole race, is reputed ka-\ndischi.

They arc reared by the Bedo-\nuins, in the northern deserts between Basso-\nra, Merdin, and the frontiers of Syria; and\nthough they are neither large nor beautiful,\ntheir race and hereditary qualities being the\nonly objects of estimation, the preservation\nof their breed is carefully and authentically\nwitnessed; and the offspring ofa Kochain\nstallion with an ignoole race, is reputed ka-\ndischi.

They are said to rush on a foe with\nimpetuosity; and 1t is asserted that some of\nthem when wounded in battle, will with\ndraw to spot where their masters may be\nsecure, and if he fall, they will neigh for as\nsstance; accordingly their value is derived\nfrom their singular agility. and extreme do\ncility, and an uncommon attachment to\ntheir master. The Arabian steeds are some\ntimes bought at excessive Rates by the Eng\nlish at Mocha. The duke of Newcastle as\nserts, that the Ordinary price OF an Arabian\nhorse is one, two, and even three thousand\npounds; and that the Arabs are as careful in\npreserving the genealogy of their horses, as\nprinces in recording that of their families\nthe grooms are very,exact in registering the\nnames of the sires and dams of these ami\nmails; and some of them are of very ancient\ndate in this species ofpedigree.
