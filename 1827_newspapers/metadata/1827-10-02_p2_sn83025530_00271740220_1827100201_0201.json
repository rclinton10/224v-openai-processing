There is\na powerful and growing sentiment ia Virginia, ia\nvorabie to the reelection of Mr.. Adams whose po-\nIcy has given general satisfaction, Notwithstanding\nthe clamor of those who speak through the columns\nof the Richmond Enquirer. All the dscordances\nwhich have existed in the public opinion of Virginia,\nare fast settling down into an harmonious con-\nvicton that it would be folly to change President\nand Administration whose course is we'll known and\napproved, for one whose doubtful and conflicting\nopinions, Judging from the conduct of his friends,\nhave left all parties in perpeyity to his princ-\nplies and feelings, and whose morals and intelligence\n\n\nnave come out of the fire to which they have been\nnecessarily subjected, without any increase Of pu-\nrity or brightness.\n\n\nWe can tell the author of the paragraph with\n\n\nwhich we commenced this article, on the authority\n| OF a Jacksonlan who has just visited the counties oi\n\n\nFrederick, Hardy and Hampshire, in Virginia that\n\n\nhe had very great difficulty to find any one to adyo-\n\n\ncate the claims Of the General, so perfectly had\n\n\npublic opinion in those counties settled down in fa-\nvor of the present Administration. To doubt that\n\n\nwhat we have stated in this paragraph will be VIC.\nlently denied and that shall be honored with 6\nfew coarse epthets for giving circulation TO the\nfacts would betray great ignorance of those\nagainst whom we have to contend The han\n\n\ngers-on at the Offices Of the jackson papers, are\n+ as numerous and as public as the loterers who\n\n\nlounge about Westminster Hall with straws in theil\nhats, signltying that they are TO be purchased b,\n\n\nsuch as have need of persons to according tc\n\n\ntheir lesson. But the truth of our statements can\nnot be overthrow by such testimony. There il\nnot well informed 4 impartial Virglnian, who will\nnot sustain us. We will not pretend to give de\nclded opinion as to the result Of the electoral vot\nJ, in Virginia, because We have not sufficient mate\n+ rials for the formation of such: hut it require\n\n\nnothing more than the ordinary use Of our faculties\n\n\nto understand the direction to which the public sen\nment is tending and to conclude that this tendcn\n. cy premises that result which we hope and believ\nI twill produce.",
