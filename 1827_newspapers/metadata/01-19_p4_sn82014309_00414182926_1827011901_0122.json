He had imbibed strong prejudices against us, and had avoi- ded all intercourse with us, till his own mind had become deeply impressed by req ding a New Testament that fell in his way. He now comes almost every night to read the scriptures with Mir. Bird, and to beg his prayers. It really seems, as if this were \"the acceptable year of the Lord, !\" and as if the Holy Comforter, so long ban l ished from these regions, had come back 1 in triumph, to make these \"tentS of ke- dar\" once more the sweet abodes of peace and love. We have joy in our hearts we have joy in our dwellings; and we look, with the most devout earnestness, and de- lightful lanticipations, to the day, when such '' times of refreshing shall come,'' as shall give joy to all the churches, and shall fill all heaven with praise.\n\n June 3O.-Almost every day, we read the scriptures in ancient Armenian, modern Armenian, Turkish, Turkish Armenian, ancient Greek, modern Greek, Arabic, l. talian and English, and sometimes we hear them read in the Syriac, Hebrew and French. Seldom do we set down to our meals without hearing conversation at the table in ancient and modern Armenian. Turkish, Greek, Arabic, Italian and Eng lish. And with the exception of the Ital- ian, prayers daily ascend from this house, hope to heaven, in all these languages.\n\n The number of those who read the scrip lures with us every evening and every Sabbath, gradually increases. Among those on the Sabbath, are found Armenians, Greeks, Greek Catholics, Maronites, Jews, and occasionally Syrian, Mussulman, or a Latin. Those of us, who read with them, are from England, America, and Ger many. Our assembly is literally of many kindreds and tongues\" We are always a. ble, when necessary, 10 have reading and conversation in ten or twelve different lan- guages, exclusive of several dialects.\n\n The priests are filled with wrath, and pour forth their threats and their curses in torrents. But their violent dealings, tho they doubtless deter many from coming to us and though they are grievous for the poor sufferers, yet awaken so much the greater curiosity in the public mind to know \"w what this new doctrine is.''\n\n July 26.-So much is now transpiring every day in regard to religion, as to keep us in a high state of expectation. Scarce ly a day passes, in which we can be said to have quiet, unagitated minds. Another Armenian priest has come long journey to see US and to join us, so oI see not but that we are like to become Kingdom of Priests and Archbishops. o that the work ofregeneration might keep pace with the excitement Asaad Shediak--it is now a week since we have daredto pray for him with any degree of confidence, that he is living. The Patriarch wrote to the brothers of Asaad, to come and take him, for he was almost dead from his bonds and stripes, and he could9nOt bring him back to the Catholic faith.\n\n ",

On this eminence rose a village surpassing in beauty the loveliest hab- itations of the valley. This village and its environs formed the most enchanting land scapes ever beheld.\n\n Every charm which nature and art could bestow, were here combined to grace the scene. The lofty palm, the majestic oak, the weeping birch, and the graceful cedar, with numerous other natives of the forest, united to add elegance and beauty to it's neatly built dwellings.\n\n In. the centre of this charming village rose g temple, beautiful for the simplicity and gran deur of its architecture, and venerable for its antiquity. The Lord of the village who en- tertained a peculiar regard for the tenants whom he had planted on this mountain; eau sed spring to issue from the Temple, whose pure aud heathful waters possessed the pow CT of healing all who drank deeply at the . medical stream, let their infrmities and sick -nesses be ever SO great. Whoever drank of ten and freely of this fountain, never thirsted after the intoxicating cup held out by Luxury. It dissolved the chains forged by Ambition, Covetousness and Revenge. The Lord of the mountain who caused this spring to flow, and gave it power to heal, promised thatit should never cease so long as they preserved the Temple which covered t. This fountain fell into bosom of white marble, which stood at the entrance of the porch of the temple. Who ever consulted this mirror, called the mirror of Truth, saw their own characters reflected on it's chrystal surface. The passions of the soul, and each sinful propensity of the heart DOT trayed in its pure waters. Now saw in my dream noble race of men, who took great delight in consulting this fountain, that they might discern in its limpid wave what man ner ofpersons they were, and when they per ceyed any spot of vice or error appear on their conferences, immediately applied to the physician to have it removed. But inpro- cess of time these venerable fathers disappea- red, the narrow house received them in quick succession, only here and there one was seen walking through the streets. \"A new genera ton arose, but with less majestic mien, and who did not like, their predecessors, consult daily the mirror of Truth. Then saw in my dream the Temple shaken to its foundation by great earthquake. The inhabitants were alarmed, and placed several props to support the shattered building, but these props were shaken by the blasts of winter. and the Tenn pie seemed tottering, and ready to fall. Ma ny persons who loved even the ruins of their ancient Temple, which covered the sacred fountain, called loudly on their friends and neighbors to repair the ruins they beheld, but their cries were vain, they needed not the warning voice. While was wondering at their indifference, was informed by grey headed saint, that majority of the inhabitants oftbis once happy village, had long neglected to consult the mirror at the porch of the Tenn pie, and felt not the need of such faithful guide. And in fact some of them wished the building to fall, being offended at the appear ance of their faces when they last looked into l the mirror of Truth. Others were so much absorbed in their own reflections they did not l observe the decay of the Temple, and wonde- redwhat alarmed their neighbors. l was much s 5erpiexed at this stupidity in the midst of such eminent danger, till saw that instead off regarding the commands of the Lord of the mountain, to keep his Temple in repair, and preserve the fountain of health and happiness from pollution, they were making little idols which they worshipped in secret, and even prefcred st6 him who had ever been kind & gracious master to them and their fathers. These idols which had so infatuated this de- < lIded people consisting chiefly of pyramidcal heaps of shining sand of a yellow cast, but of So light nature, that the slightest wind might disperse them. Some of these infatuated people had gathered a pile so high as entirely to intercept view ofthe Temple Others had a pile not larger than small ant hill, but they were so much engaged in contemplating these puny heaps, as their more fortunate neighbors who had gathered mighty mound of shin ing dust. My wonder was increased t0sob- serve with what care they watched their put ny objects of adoration, and how eagerly they ran about to add another grain to the mound. My heart was filled with sorrow to, see how { closely they grasped their store, and what an- gry expressions escaped their lips if any per son reminded them it was their duty to spare part of their treasured mounds to stop the l. | l~- .l n.",

He had imbibed strong prejudices against us, and had avoi- ded all intercourse with us, till his own mind had become deeply impressed by req ding a New Testament that fell in his way. He now comes almost every night to read the scriptures with Mir. Bird, and to beg his prayers. It really seems, as if this were \"the acceptable year of the Lord, !\" and as if the Holy Comforter, so long ban l ished from these regions, had come back 1 in triumph, to make these \"tentS of ke- dar\" once more the sweet abodes of peace and love. We have joy in our hearts we have joy in our dwellings; and we look, with the most devout earnestness, and de- lightful lanticipations, to the day, when such '' times of refreshing shall come,'' as shall give joy to all the churches, and shall fill all heaven with praise.\n\n June 3O.-Almost every day, we read the scriptures in ancient Armenian, modern Armenian, Turkish, Turkish Armenian, ancient Greek, modern Greek, Arabic, l. talian and English, and sometimes we hear them read in the Syriac, Hebrew and French. Seldom do we set down to our meals without hearing conversation at the table in ancient and modern Armenian. Turkish, Greek, Arabic, Italian and Eng lish. And with the exception of the Ital- ian, prayers daily ascend from this house, hope to heaven, in all these languages.\n\n The number of those who read the scrip lures with us every evening and every Sabbath, gradually increases. Among those on the Sabbath, are found Armenians, Greeks, Greek Catholics, Maronites, Jews, and occasionally Syrian, Mussulman, or a Latin. Those of us, who read with them, are from England, America, and Ger many. Our assembly is literally of many kindreds and tongues\" We are always a. ble, when necessary, 10 have reading and conversation in ten or twelve different lan- guages, exclusive of several dialects.\n\n The priests are filled with wrath, and pour forth their threats and their curses in torrents. But their violent dealings, tho they doubtless deter many from coming to us and though they are grievous for the poor sufferers, yet awaken so much the greater curiosity in the public mind to know \"w what this new doctrine is.''\n\n July 26.-So much is now transpiring every day in regard to religion, as to keep us in a high state of expectation. Scarce ly a day passes, in which we can be said to have quiet, unagitated minds. Another Armenian priest has come long journey to see US and to join us, so oI see not but that we are like to become Kingdom of Priests and Archbishops. o that the work ofregeneration might keep pace with the excitement Asaad Shediak--it is now a week since we have daredto pray for him with any degree of confidence, that he is living. The Patriarch wrote to the brothers of Asaad, to come and take him, for he was almost dead from his bonds and stripes, and he could9nOt bring him back to the Catholic faith.\n\n ",

On this eminence rose a village surpassing in beauty the loveliest hab- itations of the valley. This village and its environs formed the most enchanting land scapes ever beheld.\n\n Every charm which nature and art could bestow, were here combined to grace the scene. The lofty palm, the majestic oak, the weeping birch, and the graceful cedar, with numerous other natives of the forest, united to add elegance and beauty to it's neatly built dwellings.\n\n In. the centre of this charming village rose g temple, beautiful for the simplicity and gran deur of its architecture, and venerable for its antiquity. The Lord of the village who en- tertained a peculiar regard for the tenants whom he had planted on this mountain; eau sed spring to issue from the Temple, whose pure aud heathful waters possessed the pow CT of healing all who drank deeply at the . medical stream, let their infrmities and sick -nesses be ever SO great. Whoever drank of ten and freely of this fountain, never thirsted after the intoxicating cup held out by Luxury. It dissolved the chains forged by Ambition, Covetousness and Revenge. The Lord of the mountain who caused this spring to flow, and gave it power to heal, promised thatit should never cease so long as they preserved the Temple which covered t. This fountain fell into bosom of white marble, which stood at the entrance of the porch of the temple. Who ever consulted this mirror, called the mirror of Truth, saw their own characters reflected on it's chrystal surface. The passions of the soul, and each sinful propensity of the heart DOT trayed in its pure waters. Now saw in my dream noble race of men, who took great delight in consulting this fountain, that they might discern in its limpid wave what man ner ofpersons they were, and when they per ceyed any spot of vice or error appear on their conferences, immediately applied to the physician to have it removed. But inpro- cess of time these venerable fathers disappea- red, the narrow house received them in quick succession, only here and there one was seen walking through the streets. \"A new genera ton arose, but with less majestic mien, and who did not like, their predecessors, consult daily the mirror of Truth. Then saw in my dream the Temple shaken to its foundation by great earthquake. The inhabitants were alarmed, and placed several props to support the shattered building, but these props were shaken by the blasts of winter. and the Tenn pie seemed tottering, and ready to fall. Ma ny persons who loved even the ruins of their ancient Temple, which covered the sacred fountain, called loudly on their friends and neighbors to repair the ruins they beheld, but their cries were vain, they needed not the warning voice. While was wondering at their indifference, was informed by grey headed saint, that majority of the inhabitants oftbis once happy village, had long neglected to consult the mirror at the porch of the Tenn pie, and felt not the need of such faithful guide. And in fact some of them wished the building to fall, being offended at the appear ance of their faces when they last looked into l the mirror of Truth. Others were so much absorbed in their own reflections they did not l observe the decay of the Temple, and wonde- redwhat alarmed their neighbors. l was much s 5erpiexed at this stupidity in the midst of such eminent danger, till saw that instead off regarding the commands of the Lord of the mountain, to keep his Temple in repair, and preserve the fountain of health and happiness from pollution, they were making little idols which they worshipped in secret, and even prefcred st6 him who had ever been kind & gracious master to them and their fathers. These idols which had so infatuated this de- < lIded people consisting chiefly of pyramidcal heaps of shining sand of a yellow cast, but of So light nature, that the slightest wind might disperse them. Some of these infatuated people had gathered a pile so high as entirely to intercept view ofthe Temple Others had a pile not larger than small ant hill, but they were so much engaged in contemplating these puny heaps, as their more fortunate neighbors who had gathered mighty mound of shin ing dust. My wonder was increased t0sob- serve with what care they watched their put ny objects of adoration, and how eagerly they ran about to add another grain to the mound. My heart was filled with sorrow to, see how { closely they grasped their store, and what an- gry expressions escaped their lips if any per son reminded them it was their duty to spare part of their treasured mounds to stop the l. | l~- .l n.",

June l9,- 1926.\n\n l THE ARMENIANs.\n\n You already know, that the Archbishop at Sidon, the Archbishop in my family, and the monk in my service, have married I wives, in violation of the most sacred caii- ons of their own, and of all the oriental churches. This bold step of theirs, in breaking away from the customs of their fathers, has been noised abroad through I the whole country, and has produced not little excitement. Another Armenian monk, has also recently followed their ex- l ample.\n\n One important benefit of these narria- ges has been, to excite inquiry, to bring the Bible into notice, and to lead to the examination of other customs and canons, which have had the sanction of ages, and all the corroboration, which pretended mir acles could give. I do not think l state more than sober facts will justify, when I say that the Armenians appear to be ava king from the slumber of many generations,\n\n \n\n ful and desirable impression from theda- bors, and examples, and instructions of able and devoted missionaries. .la-\n\n Jacob Aga, at-Sidon, collects his neigh bors every Sabbath, and reads with them, or to them, the sacred Scriptures, inter- spersing the same with remarks, which though probably not very experimental or spiritual, but confined to the external af- fairs ofthe church, yet serve to direct mems attention to the Bible, and thus to pre- pare the way of the Lord.'\n\n Signor Wortabet, in my service, who left the convent about a year and half d. go, as wild and as thoughtless, as it was in the liatnre of convent to make s:.s, has now apparently conviction of sin, and is an earnest enquirer to know what salvation is, and how it is to be obtained I\n\n ARAB lNQUIRERs.\n\n 1t was not till within few months, that we found any among the Arabs, who would acknowledge themselves to be in state of sin and death. Every body \" lasted twice week, and thanked God, that he was not as other men,\" Several individuals appear now to be convinced, that they are in state of condemnation. Of this class are three of our schoolmasters.\n\n A few no longer frequent the churches, nor confess to the priests, nor observe the lasts, nor pray to the saints, nor bow down before their images, nor regard the festivals in honour of them. Of this class, is an A rab youth of the Greek Church, who has been with. me near two years. 1t is now more than six months, that he has profess sed to renounce all dependence for salva- ton upon the intercession of the saints, the numerous lasts the oft repeated payers, GL prescribed nostrums of his church, and to, believe, that the blood of Christ alone can release him from guilt. On the recent death of his mother, lie refused to pay any I thing to the priests to secure th@sr prayers for her benefit. His father and brother & friends, first entreated, and then. reviled him, and the priest threatened him; but he still persisted saying, 1\" had better buy bread and give to the poor, for this will be a real charity whereas. praying forever for my mother, will nut. alter her condition.' .'' I The priests said, that perhaps he would soon die, and no body would pray for kim. Ho replied, \"I wish no one, to pray for me after am dead it will be of no avail\" 4 Of this class, also, is another Arab youth of the same Church, about thirteen years of age, whom we have instructed in Ital- ian and English, and caused to be instruct- ed in tho grammar of his own language, and in ancient an modern Greek.
