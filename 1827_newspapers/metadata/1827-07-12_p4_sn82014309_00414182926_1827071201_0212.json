July 2.\n\n Destructive HGI StOrm.--The north west part of our county has been visited by most extraordinary and destructive hail storm, de- strOyiDg in it's course acres of most beautiful grain. On Monday afternoon last, there was violent shower, accompanied with hail, com menced in the north part of the town of Cal hOun, passed across the town of Minisink to BroOkhRId, and from thence extending through the Drowned Lands to Pine Island and Amity, in the town of Warwick, fields of grain were completely destroyed, Some far mers lost all they had sown; scarcely spear left standing. We have heard that sev- eral individuals estimate their losses at $500.\n\n The size of the hail stones were unusually large. averaging from three quarters to one inch in diameter. Many pains of glass were broken. In the Brookfield Meeting House, something like l5O were destroyed, and in Amity Meeting House still larger number. It made great havoc among the poultry, ,and we are told that even calves were much in- jured. On the day after the storm, large quantities of the hail stones were collected in places, bushels were scraped together and deposited in ice houses.\n\n Thus were blasted in few short minutes, the well-founded hopes of many of our far mers, who to all appearance seemed justified in anticipating abundant crops; but at the same time. we are all practically taught val able lesson, upon the uncertainty of things in this lifn.-Ind.

July 2.\n\n Destructive HGI StOrm.--The north west part of our county has been visited by most extraordinary and destructive hail storm, de- strOyiDg in it's course acres of most beautiful grain. On Monday afternoon last, there was violent shower, accompanied with hail, com menced in the north part of the town of Cal hOun, passed across the town of Minisink to BroOkhRId, and from thence extending through the Drowned Lands to Pine Island and Amity, in the town of Warwick, fields of grain were completely destroyed, Some far mers lost all they had sown; scarcely spear left standing. We have heard that sev- eral individuals estimate their losses at $500.\n\n The size of the hail stones were unusually large. averaging from three quarters to one inch in diameter. Many pains of glass were broken. In the Brookfield Meeting House, something like l5O were destroyed, and in Amity Meeting House still larger number. It made great havoc among the poultry, ,and we are told that even calves were much in- jured. On the day after the storm, large quantities of the hail stones were collected in places, bushels were scraped together and deposited in ice houses.\n\n Thus were blasted in few short minutes, the well-founded hopes of many of our far mers, who to all appearance seemed justified in anticipating abundant crops; but at the same time. we are all practically taught val able lesson, upon the uncertainty of things in this lifn.-Ind.

As the fold is octave, he volumes are not nearly so large as the quarto editons but the paper finer and whiter the execution handsomer the print to appearance nearly as large; and it can be turned to the light with much less Inconvenience, it may perhaps he read with equal ease and pleasure. It has the advantage of be- ing cheaper, less cumbersome, and more elegant.\n\n \"ARMSTRONG'S EDITION, therefore, is the one which can most highly recommend for the use of families. It is peculiarly calculated to supersede the use of large Bible and in two respects it will answer better purpose merely for reading the scrip lures, as 1t is less cumbersome, and may be read by several persons at the same time.\"\n\n .r ALSO\n\n Just received and for Sale as aboye",
