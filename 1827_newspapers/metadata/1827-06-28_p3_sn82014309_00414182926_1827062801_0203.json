The Pacha of Trpoli has communicated this intelligence the auhorthority of letter, which his vassal the governor of Ghada mes, wrote to apprse him of the event, and which let ter reached him in less than en days, being convey ed by an extraordinary courier. The British travel\n\n ers, who were at first stated to have fallen under the weapons of the robbers, in the territory of Tonal, had then been only wounded, that after having es capped this first danger, through the philanthropy of Marabout, they at length reached Tombuctoo. Shortly after their arrival in that city, the Feans, which powerful and warlike tribe now reigns exclu- siveiy over the immense deserts of Central Africa, appeared to the number of 3O,OOO, and imperiously demanded that the travellers should be given up to them in order that they might put them to death and thereby prevent the Christians from availing them selves of the information to be gained by their means, and from penetrating some day into these remote countries to enslave the people. Such are the ex- pressions of the Schek of Ghadames in his letter to the Pacha. The Prince commanding Tombuctoo re- fused to give up the strangers whom he had received with benevolence; and in order to withdraw them from the enmity of their prosecutors whose resent ment he was unwilling to provoke, he sent them off secretly to Bambara escorted by fifteen horsmen, se- lected from his own body guard but being speedily oyertaken by party oiTellans, who had rapidly Pur- ed them on hearing of their escape, the unfortunate Laing mercilessly strangled with all his compan- ions Such was the trag gca end of the intrepid uav- eler, who the first to penetrate into the precincts 1 s ,n9 sx 3 of which is still likely to es cape the best directed inquiries, according to all appearance, there is no hope of recovering the pa Pers of the unfortunate Laing.

As a upon that act, this same authority have recently voted hundred dollars to be expended in powder Sc. &c. the ap- preaching Fourth of Jnly.'

We doubt not but large majority of the rateabe polls in that city friends to temperance and also to tire Colonization Society; and that had the question been understandingy put to each of these cit izens whether hundred dollars should be spent in promoting noise x intemperance, agreeably to the aforementioned vote, or wheh it should go into the treasury of the Col Society,\" and the day be spent season of thanksgiving and praise, nineenths would have voted for the atter rather than the former mode of celebrating the birthday of American Libcrty\"- by such public appropriations of money, that the evil complained of becomes national sin; and such it will be punished with national caamities.\n\n Upon tue least calculation which can be made, not less than two thousand dollars annually spent the \"Fourth of July in Litchfeld County; the greates: share of which is worse than thrown away. May not quarter part of this be this year given for the relief the oppressed African who groans in slavery, in land whose triumphant motto is |\" All men are born equally free and independently The American Colonization Society,-composed principally of dis tngushed individuals of the South, where the evils of slavery felt by the master well the slave are engaged in great and good work; and they look to the friends of humanity for assistance. They have called upon to remember them on the coming anni- versary of American Independence. Shall they call in vain Can the friends of temperance and morality, who have heretofore spent this day, one two or three dollars, simply for the graacon of their appe- ttcs render consistent tribute of gratitude to Heaven for the blessings of liberty than by bestowing like sum in favor ofuniversal emancipation Would not conscience approve such act, as calculated to procure for hegyer, tn, blessing of thousands ready 10 perish I've know of many who are disposed to give, bat who plead want of opportunity, there being public asscmblage in their vicinity, which they wish to join and they are therefore under the ne cessity of tarryng at home, and no call is made upon their charity.

The Pacha of Trpoli has communicated this intelligence the auhorthority of letter, which his vassal the governor of Ghada mes, wrote to apprse him of the event, and which let ter reached him in less than en days, being convey ed by an extraordinary courier. The British travel\n\n ers, who were at first stated to have fallen under the weapons of the robbers, in the territory of Tonal, had then been only wounded, that after having es capped this first danger, through the philanthropy of Marabout, they at length reached Tombuctoo. Shortly after their arrival in that city, the Feans, which powerful and warlike tribe now reigns exclu- siveiy over the immense deserts of Central Africa, appeared to the number of 3O,OOO, and imperiously demanded that the travellers should be given up to them in order that they might put them to death and thereby prevent the Christians from availing them selves of the information to be gained by their means, and from penetrating some day into these remote countries to enslave the people. Such are the ex- pressions of the Schek of Ghadames in his letter to the Pacha. The Prince commanding Tombuctoo re- fused to give up the strangers whom he had received with benevolence; and in order to withdraw them from the enmity of their prosecutors whose resent ment he was unwilling to provoke, he sent them off secretly to Bambara escorted by fifteen horsmen, se- lected from his own body guard but being speedily oyertaken by party oiTellans, who had rapidly Pur- ed them on hearing of their escape, the unfortunate Laing mercilessly strangled with all his compan- ions Such was the trag gca end of the intrepid uav- eler, who the first to penetrate into the precincts 1 s ,n9 sx 3 of which is still likely to es cape the best directed inquiries, according to all appearance, there is no hope of recovering the pa Pers of the unfortunate Laing.

The work recommends itself both by the price, being only 25 per year, where eight copies are aken and also by the choice selection of matter, suit able for the instruction and benefit of Sabbath School children, for whom it is intended.\n\n We perhaps ought also to mention weekly paper issued from the office of the Boston Recorder, edited by Mir. N. Willis and Rev. A. Rand entitled \"Youth's Companion\" published weekly at one dollar peryear, in advance, terms fraction less than the above men, toned, considering the number printed in year,-l2 at 25 cents-52 at $1 ,00. Both are cheap, and both admirably calculated benefit the rising generation. Three numbers of the: \" Youths Companion\" have been published, containing rich variety of useful and entertaining matter, as far can judge from the contents Can young friends do better than join together in small companies and put in their nne- pence apece money usually spentfor \"sugar plumbs\" and \" raisns '-and send on to Boston or New-York, for one of these interesting publications? Would not parents do well encourage such step in their chil- dren Children should be early taught that much good may be done only to themselves, but to oth- CTS, by liberal and proper application ofmoney and we know of nothing which would make them feel that money possessed an intrinsic value, better than to ap- ply small portion for newspaper published express y for their good and containing matter calculated to interest instruct and enlarge the liberal feelings of their nature.\n\n The newspaper mania in New-York runs at present very high-beatng the canal and banking mania all hollow. Daily, sem-weekly, and weekly papers, are multiplying there alarming degree, especially to the publishing interest Among the many otherswhich have of,ate appeared is one entitled \"The Age\" to be edited by the late publisher of the Albany Mic- yoscope.\" In his prospectus the editor says we shall endeavor to hold up mirror, in which mankind may see the foies and vices of the age in which we live, reflected in their true colors.\" Had he said, i've shall hold up mirror in which mankind may see the folies and vices of\" The Age\" he would have come nearer the truth as will be manifest by his columns",
