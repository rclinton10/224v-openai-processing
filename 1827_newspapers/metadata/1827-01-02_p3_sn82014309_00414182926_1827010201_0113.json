Whatever impulse sets in motion the powers of the mind, is felt either directly or indirectly by the body; as on the contra ry, whatever causes affect the body, whether they he natural-as heat and cold, hunger and thirst, or whether they be health or decease, these operating directly in the body itself have a collateral effect in the mind, and tend either to make it elastic and happy, full of high hopes and jocund as the spring, or produce a despondency which prcys upon our happi- ness, and oftentimes, makes us feel as if we were outcasts from the favours of providence, and that our destiny was to be miserable. Onr happiness then must necessarily depend in the main on the situation of the body. In proportion as the latter is weighed down by any of those diseases which prove to us the frailty of our natures, the former is the sub .ject of restIessness and disquietude. Not but that the mind may, Independently ofthe body, engender and multiply its own troubles; it often does, and many sore wound does it infiictin itself; but now speak of those causes which commence acting on the body and are through the medium of the body made to op- crate oh the mind. The mutual dependence then of body and mind for the support and comfort of each other, makes it of the highest moment to take care about the introduction into either, ofany more trouble than is by ne- cessity caused from the constitution and con dition of our natures, and by events and cir cumstances beyond our controul. But many are the pains endured by our habits, and ma my thorn is made to rankle in our bosoms. planted there by our own hands.\n\n Customs and long cherished notions make many courses fashionable which courses are so many post roads on which thousands of the eager vOtarics of pleasure travel some to an early grave, others to premature old age; while others find themselves engrdled by circle of diseases which torture both body & lnind. It is of vast importance then that the mind be made to think in correct channels, & that the body be trained up to the exercise of whatever is necessary to the regular perform ance of its functions and the health of all its members. We prostrate the fairest the no- biest work of God, when by neglect, or in- temperance, we sow the seeds of dissolution in ourselyes--we make advances to our great est enemy, death, when we employ any of the emissaries which he sends to us On errands of destruction, and thousands of these emissa- are abroad in the world sucking up the juices of human happiness, and endeavouring with all their malignant cunning at the destruction ofthe human race. Already have they thrown a portentious gloom over this land of civili- zation and refinement, already has intempe- rance spread her sable mantle upon the bo- som of our country and when and how she is to dismantle herself God only knows. It must be ere long as it will have nipped the tenderest buds that put forth from the bosom of our families. This nation proudly vaunts herself on her physical strength and resources, while a disease turks within her veins nrure fa- tai than the pestiferous blasts of the Simeon, and more to be dreaded than fleets end armies. The attention of many has been called to this subject. It demands yigoHrous and decided measures. do not know that there is moral principle enough in the land to stay the tide of desolation; if there is not, legislative aid must be called in.\n\n There is but one alternative, either intem- perance or our national prosperity and per haps cur national existence, must cease. The men of former generation trained as they were to arms, their constitutions made vigor- ous and healthful by athletic sports and inured to toil and hardship in every possible shape. could mingle in scenes of debauchery and in- temperance and yet eke out long life but either from the peculiarity of our climate or some other natural cause, or from the degen- eracy of the present race of men from the physical strength and hardihood of their an- cestors, the process is now summary: and thousands of youth, the flower of our land & the hopes of their parents yearly fall before this sirocco, like the yellow leaves which the autumnal blast strows upon the health.

In the House, a brief discussion was e.\n\n icited by a resolution offered by Mir. Cook, the object of which was to obtain some relief for the purchasers ofland who, not having completed their payments, have incurred the penalty of forfeiture of the lands. His resolutions asked for the ap- pointment of Select Committee to in- quire into the expediency of exchanging these certificates for scrip, which the hold CTS might dispose of for other lands.\n\n The resolution was amended, on motion of Mr. Campbell, so as tn be referred to the Committee on Public Lands.\n\n From the papers of the day we learn that the small pox, that most loatIAsome of all di- seases, is again making its appearance ia our country. More than sixty cases have occur red at Staten Island, N. Y. about twenty of which have proved fatal. A number of cases have also occurred at New Haven. The Re gister mentions three or four cases in North Brandford. The Mercury says this disease prevails to an alarming degree in the town of Bolton. Several other towns are also visited | by this terrible scourge. Providence has pla- l ced within the reach of every person an effect ua safe-g guard against this baleful disease; & he who refuses to employ the remedy for Himself and his children does an injury which may be lrreparable. The Mercury asks, G. Where is Dr. Fansher ?\" We answer, he has been in this county with very little benefit to commit nity, and an actual loss to himself; the people having been too busily engaged about their 'iarms and merchandise 3 to profit by his skill\n\n and experience. He is now in Vermont, where We trust the prudence of the citizens will amply remunerate him for his labours and expense for the public good.\n\n Trials for M,uder.-On the goth and elst ults. the trial of Winslow Curtis came on, for the murder of Capt. Edward Selfridge, cap tain of the schooner Fairy. On the last day the jury returned a verdict ofguilty. Charles | Merchant was previously tried for the murder 1 fir. r. Jenkins, mate of the same schooner, and found guilty. On the 23d the criminals received sentence of death, aud are to be exc cuted on the first ofFebruary. A Boston pa per says, \"After the sentence ,whicl was pro- nounced by Judge Story in most solemn and impressive lnanner, the prisoners gave ut terance to their feelings in the most horrid imprecations ofvengence and malignity upon the Judge, the attorney general, the witnes- ses, and the souls ofthe victims they had been convicted of murdering, in language too shocking for repetition. Such scene of de- pravity and hardihood, it is presumed, has never before, in this country at least, been witnessed in court ofjustice.''\n\n But little business has been transacted at Washington since the 24th ult. up to our last l dates. Levees and parties of pleasure occu pied the whole attention of our HOnourables during the first week of Christmas. This ] suspension of Congressional news gives the knowing ones an opportunity to indulge in cOnjectures relative to the difficulties between this country and England. Some pretend to see specks of war, and others predict the complete overthrow of the administration, as they are disposed to visit upon MT. Adams and the cabinet the whole blame ofthe loss of the VI. trade. For ourselves we can see no other signs of war than in a belief that it will materially benefit the |\" mother country\" in hCA PitSCHt uisuSSSs to cILEuOy puTuOU OI her suffering surplus population in making conquests, Or in attempting to humble the pride and ambition of her enterprising quan- dam daughter. Whether the late act of Par lament and subsequent conduct, be the pre- cursor for picking quarrel. time will deter mine.-And as for the ruin of the great re- publican family, at the bead of which is J.. Q. Adams, II. Clay, Sc. we have no fears. The good sense and patriotism of this cOuntry,wi! never yield an undoubted right, alright toper- feet reciprocity in trade, for the '' boon,\" as Mir. Secretary Canning calls the w. I. trade; neither will the unjust demands ofthe British cabinet effect the popularity of the adminis- tration, or destroy the confidence which the people have reposed in it. 0}@For the greater accommodation of several\n\n towns in the county, and with the hope of\n\n extending the circulation of our paper, we\n\n shall hereafter issue the County Post on\n\n Friday, instead of Tuesday, of each week.\n\n Our next number will of course be publish\n\n cd on the l2th insts Our present subscri- 1\n\n bcrs will be able to receive their papers as\n\n early after publication, as they have hereto\n\n fore received them. 0T@The Slips in the Episcopal Church in\n\n this village will be rented for one year on",

Whatever impulse sets in motion the powers of the mind, is felt either directly or indirectly by the body; as on the contra ry, whatever causes affect the body, whether they he natural-as heat and cold, hunger and thirst, or whether they be health or decease, these operating directly in the body itself have a collateral effect in the mind, and tend either to make it elastic and happy, full of high hopes and jocund as the spring, or produce a despondency which prcys upon our happi- ness, and oftentimes, makes us feel as if we were outcasts from the favours of providence, and that our destiny was to be miserable. Onr happiness then must necessarily depend in the main on the situation of the body. In proportion as the latter is weighed down by any of those diseases which prove to us the frailty of our natures, the former is the sub .ject of restIessness and disquietude. Not but that the mind may, Independently ofthe body, engender and multiply its own troubles; it often does, and many sore wound does it infiictin itself; but now speak of those causes which commence acting on the body and are through the medium of the body made to op- crate oh the mind. The mutual dependence then of body and mind for the support and comfort of each other, makes it of the highest moment to take care about the introduction into either, ofany more trouble than is by ne- cessity caused from the constitution and con dition of our natures, and by events and cir cumstances beyond our controul. But many are the pains endured by our habits, and ma my thorn is made to rankle in our bosoms. planted there by our own hands.\n\n Customs and long cherished notions make many courses fashionable which courses are so many post roads on which thousands of the eager vOtarics of pleasure travel some to an early grave, others to premature old age; while others find themselves engrdled by circle of diseases which torture both body & lnind. It is of vast importance then that the mind be made to think in correct channels, & that the body be trained up to the exercise of whatever is necessary to the regular perform ance of its functions and the health of all its members. We prostrate the fairest the no- biest work of God, when by neglect, or in- temperance, we sow the seeds of dissolution in ourselyes--we make advances to our great est enemy, death, when we employ any of the emissaries which he sends to us On errands of destruction, and thousands of these emissa- are abroad in the world sucking up the juices of human happiness, and endeavouring with all their malignant cunning at the destruction ofthe human race. Already have they thrown a portentious gloom over this land of civili- zation and refinement, already has intempe- rance spread her sable mantle upon the bo- som of our country and when and how she is to dismantle herself God only knows. It must be ere long as it will have nipped the tenderest buds that put forth from the bosom of our families. This nation proudly vaunts herself on her physical strength and resources, while a disease turks within her veins nrure fa- tai than the pestiferous blasts of the Simeon, and more to be dreaded than fleets end armies. The attention of many has been called to this subject. It demands yigoHrous and decided measures. do not know that there is moral principle enough in the land to stay the tide of desolation; if there is not, legislative aid must be called in.\n\n There is but one alternative, either intem- perance or our national prosperity and per haps cur national existence, must cease. The men of former generation trained as they were to arms, their constitutions made vigor- ous and healthful by athletic sports and inured to toil and hardship in every possible shape. could mingle in scenes of debauchery and in- temperance and yet eke out long life but either from the peculiarity of our climate or some other natural cause, or from the degen- eracy of the present race of men from the physical strength and hardihood of their an- cestors, the process is now summary: and thousands of youth, the flower of our land & the hopes of their parents yearly fall before this sirocco, like the yellow leaves which the autumnal blast strows upon the health.

            "article": "MT Johnson, of Kentucky, from the Se- i lect Committee on the bill for G6OIisking l Imprisonment for debt, reported the bill with amendments.\n\n Att o'clock the Senate went into the consideration of Executive business. In the House, a brief discussion was e.\n\n icited by a resolution offered by Mir. Cook, the object of which was to obtain some relief for the purchasers ofland who, not having completed their payments, have incurred the penalty of forfeiture of the lands. His resolutions asked for the ap- pointment of Select Committee to in- quire into the expediency of exchanging these certificates for scrip, which the hold CTS might dispose of for other lands.\n\n The resolution was amended, on motion of Mr. Campbell, so as tn be referred to the Committee on Public Lands.\n\n From the papers of the day we learn that the small pox, that most loatIAsome of all di- seases, is again making its appearance ia our country. More than sixty cases have occur red at Staten Island, N. Y. about twenty of which have proved fatal. A number of cases have also occurred at New Haven. The Re gister mentions three or four cases in North Brandford. The Mercury says this disease prevails to an alarming degree in the town of Bolton. Several other towns are also visited | by this terrible scourge. Providence has pla- l ced within the reach of every person an effect ua safe-g guard against this baleful disease; & he who refuses to employ the remedy for Himself and his children does an injury which may be lrreparable. The Mercury asks, G. Where is Dr. Fansher ?\" We answer, he has been in this county with very little benefit to commit nity, and an actual loss to himself; the people having been too busily engaged about their 'iarms and merchandise 3 to profit by his skill\n\n and experience. He is now in Vermont, where We trust the prudence of the citizens will amply remunerate him for his labours and expense for the public good.\n\n Trials for M,uder.-On the goth and elst ults. the trial of Winslow Curtis came on, for the murder of Capt. Edward Selfridge, cap tain of the schooner Fairy. On the last day the jury returned a verdict ofguilty. Charles | Merchant was previously tried for the murder 1 fir. r. Jenkins, mate of the same schooner, and found guilty. On the 23d the criminals received sentence of death, aud are to be exc cuted on the first ofFebruary. A Boston pa per says, \"After the sentence ,whicl was pro- nounced by Judge Story in most solemn and impressive lnanner, the prisoners gave ut terance to their feelings in the most horrid imprecations ofvengence and malignity upon the Judge, the attorney general, the witnes- ses, and the souls ofthe victims they had been convicted of murdering, in language too shocking for repetition. Such scene of de- pravity and hardihood, it is presumed, has never before, in this country at least, been witnessed in court ofjustice.''\n\n But little business has been transacted at Washington since the 24th ult. up to our last l dates. Levees and parties of pleasure occu pied the whole attention of our HOnourables during the first week of Christmas. This ] suspension of Congressional news gives the knowing ones an opportunity to indulge in cOnjectures relative to the difficulties between this country and England. Some pretend to see specks of war, and others predict the complete overthrow of the administration, as they are disposed to visit upon MT. Adams and the cabinet the whole blame ofthe loss of the VI. trade. For ourselves we can see no other signs of war than in a belief that it will materially benefit the |\" mother country\" in hCA PitSCHt uisuSSSs to cILEuOy puTuOU OI her suffering surplus population in making conquests, Or in attempting to humble the pride and ambition of her enterprising quan- dam daughter. Whether the late act of Par lament and subsequent conduct, be the pre- cursor for picking quarrel. time will deter mine.-And as for the ruin of the great re- publican family, at the bead of which is J.. Q. Adams, II. Clay, Sc. we have no fears. The good sense and patriotism of this cOuntry,wi! never yield an undoubted right, alright toper- feet reciprocity in trade, for the '' boon,\" as Mir. Secretary Canning calls the w. I. trade; neither will the unjust demands ofthe British cabinet effect the popularity of the adminis- tration, or destroy the confidence which the people have reposed in it. 0}@For the greater accommodation of several\n\n towns in the county, and with the hope of\n\n extending the circulation of our paper, we\n\n shall hereafter issue the County Post on\n\n Friday, instead of Tuesday, of each week.\n\n Our next number will of course be publish\n\n cd on the l2th insts Our present subscri- 1\n\n bcrs will be able to receive their papers as\n\n early after publication, as they have hereto\n\n fore received them. 0T@The Slips in the Episcopal Church in\n\n this village will be rented for one year on",
