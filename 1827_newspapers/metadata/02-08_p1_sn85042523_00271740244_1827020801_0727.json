No\none has higher claims to distinguished\nplace IN history, than Nj. Egerton, who has\nfor several years borne the name ot Lord\nBridgewater. Those who have once seen--\nnay, those who have never seen this measre\nparsonage drag himself along, supported\nby two huge lacqueys, with his sugar-loat\nhat souched down over his eyes, cannot tall\nto recognize him.\n\n\nAn immense fortune enables him to graf\nify the most eXtravagant caprice that ever\npassed through the head of an Engishnan,\nII he be lent a book, he carries his poltencss\nso far as to send 1t back or rather have it\nconducted home in carriage. He gives\norders that two of his most stately steeds be\ncaparisoned. under one of his chariots and the\nvolume reclining at ease in mylord's lacdau\narrives, attended BY four footmcn in costly\nlivery, at the door of its astounded owner\nHis carriage is frequently to be seen filled\nwith his dogs. lie bcstows great care on\nthe feet Of these dogs, and orders them boots\nfor which he pays as dearly as his own.--\n| Lord BridgeWater's custom is an excellent\none for the boot ker; for besides the foul\nfeet OF each of his dogs, the supply OF hi'\nown two feet, must give constant employ\nment to several operatives. He puts on {\nnew pair OF boots every day; carefully pre-\nserving those he has once worn, and ranging\nthem in order; he commands that none\nshall touch them, but takes himself grea\npleasure in observing how much OF the yeal\nhe has each day past, by viewing the state\nof his boots. Lord Egerton is a man of few\nacquaintance, and very few of his country\nmen have got as far as the dining hall. Hi\ntable, however, is constantly set out with ;\ndozen covers, and served by suitable at\ntendance. Who, then are his privileged\nguests? No less than a dozen Of favorltt\ndogs, who daily partake of mylord's dinner\nJ seated very gravely in armed chairs, eacf\nwith napkin round his neck, and scrvan\nbehind to attend his wants.\n\n\nThese honorable quadrupcds as if CRATE\nfull for such delicate attentions, compor\nthemselves during the time OF repast with\n| decency and 0ecorum which would do more\nthan honor to party of gentlemen; but if\nby any chance, one OF them should, wlthou\ndue consideration, obey the natural instnc\nof his appetite, and transgress any OF the\nrules Of good manners, his punishment is a\nhand. You perhaps, gentle reader, sup\npose that corporeal punishment is meant al\nthe walls OF the capital so eloquently but 81\nIntellectually define 1t; but no--you are mis-\ntaken, tits ia his sclf-Iove that the offendel\n\n\nis punished. The day following the day O\nhis offence, the dog dimes and even dine\n\n\nwe'll; but not at mylord's, and as becomes ;\ndog to dine; banished to the ante-chamber\nand dressed in livery, he eats in sorrow thu\nbread of shame, and picks the bones of NOR\ntifcation, while his place at table remain\nvacant till his repentance has merited\ngenerous pardon We have not been abl\n\n\nto learn what dress Lord Egerton puts ol\nhis domestics, when he has cause to be dis\nsatisfied with their service",

No\none has higher claims to distinguished\nplace IN history, than Nj. Egerton, who has\nfor several years borne the name ot Lord\nBridgewater. Those who have once seen--\nnay, those who have never seen this measre\nparsonage drag himself along, supported\nby two huge lacqueys, with his sugar-loat\nhat souched down over his eyes, cannot tall\nto recognize him.\n\n\nAn immense fortune enables him to graf\nify the most eXtravagant caprice that ever\npassed through the head of an Engishnan,\nII he be lent a book, he carries his poltencss\nso far as to send 1t back or rather have it\nconducted home in carriage. He gives\norders that two of his most stately steeds be\ncaparisoned. under one of his chariots and the\nvolume reclining at ease in mylord's lacdau\narrives, attended BY four footmcn in costly\nlivery, at the door of its astounded owner\nHis carriage is frequently to be seen filled\nwith his dogs. lie bcstows great care on\nthe feet Of these dogs, and orders them boots\nfor which he pays as dearly as his own.--\n| Lord BridgeWater's custom is an excellent\none for the boot ker; for besides the foul\nfeet OF each of his dogs, the supply OF hi'\nown two feet, must give constant employ\nment to several operatives. He puts on {\nnew pair OF boots every day; carefully pre-\nserving those he has once worn, and ranging\nthem in order; he commands that none\nshall touch them, but takes himself grea\npleasure in observing how much OF the yeal\nhe has each day past, by viewing the state\nof his boots. Lord Egerton is a man of few\nacquaintance, and very few of his country\nmen have got as far as the dining hall. Hi\ntable, however, is constantly set out with ;\ndozen covers, and served by suitable at\ntendance. Who, then are his privileged\nguests? No less than a dozen Of favorltt\ndogs, who daily partake of mylord's dinner\nJ seated very gravely in armed chairs, eacf\nwith napkin round his neck, and scrvan\nbehind to attend his wants.\n\n\nThese honorable quadrupcds as if CRATE\nfull for such delicate attentions, compor\nthemselves during the time OF repast with\n| decency and 0ecorum which would do more\nthan honor to party of gentlemen; but if\nby any chance, one OF them should, wlthou\ndue consideration, obey the natural instnc\nof his appetite, and transgress any OF the\nrules Of good manners, his punishment is a\nhand. You perhaps, gentle reader, sup\npose that corporeal punishment is meant al\nthe walls OF the capital so eloquently but 81\nIntellectually define 1t; but no--you are mis-\ntaken, tits ia his sclf-Iove that the offendel\n\n\nis punished. The day following the day O\nhis offence, the dog dimes and even dine\n\n\nwe'll; but not at mylord's, and as becomes ;\ndog to dine; banished to the ante-chamber\nand dressed in livery, he eats in sorrow thu\nbread of shame, and picks the bones of NOR\ntifcation, while his place at table remain\nvacant till his repentance has merited\ngenerous pardon We have not been abl\n\n\nto learn what dress Lord Egerton puts ol\nhis domestics, when he has cause to be dis\nsatisfied with their service",
