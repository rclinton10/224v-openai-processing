He would stick TO his friends\nlive by his friends, md If necessary, die BY his\nfriends. He thinks the state OF things at Mr.. JEFF\nferson,s elevation to the Presidency was entirely elf.\nfcrent from what we now have and il was neces-\nsary Tor him to act as he did. MIR. J. he says en-\ntered into the administration with The erpress de-\nsign OF so welding It's power as TO break down\nproud and naughty aristocracy, who had disregard\ned the will Of the people, and had we'll nigh got their\nfeet upon heir cks--ha, the two parties were to-\ntally different in principle, end j, was incumbent\nupon MIR. ]. to consult his cabinet Tor the dismiss\nsion Of those officers who opposed his sdmnisra-\ntion.-Sir, if this assertion prove any thing i\nshows that, in the opinion OF the gentleman, there\nis nor no difference in principle between those in,\nand those out oil powerful this be true, whence\narises oil this bitterness OF attack upon the men and\nme asures Of the adj. nisraon, which so distinctly\nmarks the course o. oppostionr Does It arise from\na thirst for power and Office, or the love OF menf\nAfter all have heard Of usurpation, and bargain,\nand intrigue, such admission was net looked for.\n/ Here Mr. Houston rose 20 explain, and d:scialms\ned having made any such admission.\n\n\nMIR. w. proceeded. think sir, with The gen.\ntleman, there is some differences OF principle, as\nshall presently show. To return to Mr. Jefferson\nLet il be borne in mind that that distinguished and\nIamsnted statesman and the present incumbent OF\nthe Presidency both to their seats by the in\ntcrvention of the power Of this House.-How is il\nin relation to the unprinciped and naughty afistoc-\nracy? When Mr.. Jefferson took the oath, he used\n\n\nin his Inaugural Address, The following emphasai\nlanguage, which recommend to the gentleman's\ncareful perusal Every difference o. opinion is\nnot a difference OF principle.-We haue called by\ndifferent names brethren Of the same principle\nWe are all RePublicsns--we are all Federssts\"\nYou have here the one hand, the declarations OF\n, the gentleman, who, from the nature OF things,\ncould only know any of the facts historically. OPP\nposed to this, you have the declaration OF Mr. JET\nferson himself, openly publicly, officially made at\nthe time, in the presence of the assembled nation\nand the world. Need it be asked which o! these\n\n\nWitnesses will obtain credit to the exclusion OF the\nother trust not. But. sir, the admission that\n, Mr. Jefferson was called by circumstances to make\n! the changes he did, admits the right. With what\ndiscreet ii was exercised, - mere matter OF opln-\nion, and as the gentleman from N York Mr. Wcod)\nremarked in the few words he said on this subje ect\n{ is not within your cognzance. II We look itlc\nfurther, however, VIC may discover, in the state of\nthings Immediately succeeding Mr. Jefferson's el.\novation to the Presidency, and that following the ell\novation Of the present inrum'en some points ofrs-\nsemblance, thats perhaps the gen leman did not ad\nj\nmuch indis Eliminate and coarse attack upon the\n\n\nprivate character of Mr.. Jefferson, and upon thoss\nOF the members oil his cabinet paying no regard to\nthe merits or demers OF his acts. cxhausling the\nvocabulary Of abuse and dsgrsceful to the country\nThis course cisgused the people, and prosfa-\n\n\nted, forever Frustrated the party which reanFted to\n\n\nit. In certain quarters, The asnc character oi bitter\n\n\nand indscrimnate attack and reproach has follow\n\n\ned the elevation OF MIR. Adams and his ceoinet.--\n\n\nFuture events will determine whether the people\n: have less sober Judgment now than then, or whek-\n. er the analogy will hold good throughout Mr..

But\nthis is not true. At this season OF the year, no hu\nman being can get TO the place where the body was\nsaid to be found.\n\n\nWhile upon this subject, we cannot but express\nour regret, that the Editors OF the N. Y. Gazette\nshould have admitted the communication into their\ncolumns which appears this morning under the\nsignature Of T\" Hiram.' One OF the Editors OF The\nGazette, land We know not but more,) is mason.\nand the publication, by him, of a abored article,\npalliang il not entirely excusing, the guilt OF those\nconcerned in Morgan's abduction, will have a ten\ndency to injure the craft, notwithstanding The edi\n\n\norial disclaimer OF the lengths TO which Master\nHiram goes. They could not do less, for whether\nmurdered or not Hiram would excuse the aggres\nsors. And not only Hiram, but We are concerned\nTO say that some young gentlemen OF the order\nhave created no little i'll blood among those who are\n| not masons by holding similar language. In con\nsequence OF such declarations, We have been called\nupon by respectable gentlemen, and gravely ask\ned, whether the principles OF our order compel US\nto keep The secrets ol murderer We answer, No !!\n| We are unquestionatly bound to keep The secrets\nOF our worthy\" brethren, when committed to US\nas such, 10 certain extent But in our most sol\n| tmn obligations, +\" murder\" is among the express\nexceptions.
