Forsyth says, with the\nsame side to the south which was the south\nside before: But as they cannot be got out\nof the ground nor set again into it, with their\nfull length Of roots, these must be cut off\nto length proportionate to their size.-\nWhere they are very small, let them be cut\nat the length of six or eight inches, and\nwhere they are large, double that length\nor more. Let them be carefully taken up,\nwithout breaking the roots, cutting off those\nthat get broken, and cutting them all off at\ntheir proper length; and let the hole, into\nwhich they are to be set. be sufficiently\nlarge to receive the roots without cramping\nthem: Then shake in the earth gently a.\nbout them, so as that each one shall retain\nits proper position. AS it is difficult to give\nthe fbrous roots their proper place, it is\ngenerally best to cut most of these off. In\nfruit trees, all the downright roots should be\ncut off.\n\n\nIfthe roots have been some time out Of\nground, it is advisable to soak them in wa\nter for eight or ten hours before they are\nset in. In cold or stiff soil, they should be\nset shallower. than in warm mellow one.\nAfter they are properly bedded in the\nground, a stake should be driven in near to\neach one, leaning towards them, and to these\nshey should each be tied, to keep them stea-\ndy; and some mulch should be laid round\nshe roots OF each.\n\n\nIn transplanting the smaller kinds, a wet\ntime is to be chosen, and the evening is bet\nter than any other time. AS much of the\nearth should be left round the roots as pos\nsible, in taking them out of the ground; ant\nil they are raised with a little instrument\ncalled gardeners trowel, by which bunch\nof earth can be raised with them, they viii\nbe the better for it.

Forsyth says, with the\nsame side to the south which was the south\nside before: But as they cannot be got out\nof the ground nor set again into it, with their\nfull length Of roots, these must be cut off\nto length proportionate to their size.-\nWhere they are very small, let them be cut\nat the length of six or eight inches, and\nwhere they are large, double that length\nor more. Let them be carefully taken up,\nwithout breaking the roots, cutting off those\nthat get broken, and cutting them all off at\ntheir proper length; and let the hole, into\nwhich they are to be set. be sufficiently\nlarge to receive the roots without cramping\nthem: Then shake in the earth gently a.\nbout them, so as that each one shall retain\nits proper position. AS it is difficult to give\nthe fbrous roots their proper place, it is\ngenerally best to cut most of these off. In\nfruit trees, all the downright roots should be\ncut off.\n\n\nIfthe roots have been some time out Of\nground, it is advisable to soak them in wa\nter for eight or ten hours before they are\nset in. In cold or stiff soil, they should be\nset shallower. than in warm mellow one.\nAfter they are properly bedded in the\nground, a stake should be driven in near to\neach one, leaning towards them, and to these\nshey should each be tied, to keep them stea-\ndy; and some mulch should be laid round\nshe roots OF each.\n\n\nIn transplanting the smaller kinds, a wet\ntime is to be chosen, and the evening is bet\nter than any other time. AS much of the\nearth should be left round the roots as pos\nsible, in taking them out of the ground; ant\nil they are raised with a little instrument\ncalled gardeners trowel, by which bunch\nof earth can be raised with them, they viii\nbe the better for it.
