IL is not probable that that of the United States will suffer, where the compet- ton can be made equal but 1t is possible that some dimuntion of their shipping may be eventually witt messed in favor of the flag ofsome third Power.

It may be repeated, however, that further time Is necessary for establishing definite conclusions upon this and the points adverted It IS ascerained that the imports into the U.

The gross amount that will for the last quarter of the year, IS estimated ,000 dollars; making an aggregate of twentyseven millions for the entire year.\n\n The debentures for drawbacks issued during the three first quarters of the year, amount to and the amount outstanding the Both Sept. was $5l6,96 of which 245 67, chargeable upon the revenue of lS28-The amount of duty bonds in suit on the 30th yf Sept was 436,8l2, which is more by 28,929 than was in suit sane day last year.\n\n In estimating the probable amount of duties that will be received as compared with the gross amount secured on the mporaons of the year, the necessary deductions to be made only for drawbacks but for the expenses of eoecon and various losses that may happen.

When the more exact statistical returns for the year are laid before Congress, as they will be Tn { the course of the session, it will be perceived, ] that there has been dimiuuti0n in the im 1 ports from China during the present year, as 1 compared with the past. The dimnutlOn has been very considerable, both in teas and silks This fact will show, in the end. the\n\n greater excess of importatons from Europe during the present year, whence our foreign\n\n manufactures are chiefly derived. The fourth year is now in its progress since the passage of the act of Congress augmenting the duties\n\n on imported merchandise. We are therefore\n\n at point enabling us to speak on grounds I more authentic than hitherto of the effect of that act upon the foreign commerce of the l nation.

The\n\n increase of our imports and exports since the\n\n Tariff of 1924, becomes the more striking from the consideration that in 1926 there was witnessed in Europe an extraordinary de- pression of prices. This was follo-ed by proportionate stagnation in all the operations of purchase and sale. The evil assumed magnitude, productive, in that hemisphere, not only of great individual suffering, but of anxiety in Governments. It was at moment that we began to reap the benefits of the prof. itable turn given to portion of the industry of our own country by the provisions of the taria.-Had it not been for the demand of our own manufactures for some of the agri- cultural staples of our country. the prcsump- ton is authorised that the fall ofprices in Flu rope at that period would have been different\n\n y felt by our agricultural classes here.

Nor have the benefits of 1 manufacturing industry ended here the proof\n\n strengthens that many articles have become cheaper, more abundant, and of superior\n\n quality, by the effect of competition among the home artisans, than when derived only\n\n from abroad. The opening of new objects of\n\n abour, by multiplying the occupations of men has also increased the public prosperity.-- This has produced an increased ability to buy all articles of consumption, whencesoever ob- tained.

A change since 1924, in he laws of Great Britain in regard to those. first named, has also rendered almost abOr- tive the provisions of the tariff in their favor It belongs to the purpose Of this Report,\n\n which looks to the encouragement ofthe na-\n\n tional industry in preference to any that IS fo- reign, here to state, that for period Of three years, ending with 1926, the value of cotton\n\n and woolIen goods, imported into the United States from the country just named, exceeds\n\n one hundred millions of dollars; and the val\n\n ue of iron and of articles manufactured from iron, seventeen millions. During one of these years the wOoll~ns exported from that cOun- try to this exceeds he amount ot those ex- ported to the whole of Europe put together.\n\n For the means of exchange against an amount of foreign manufactures so great, the United States have had these. principle staples of their 1Oil, viz wheat, flour, tobacco and cotton. The first of these, the same country\n\n has, by her laws, positively or virtually exclu- ded durug the same period Of years from consumption within her dOminions. The se- cond she has admitted, under duty of more than six hundrcdp per cent. The third she has i received with Iittle scruple. She has known how to convert it into means of wealth to her own industrious people, greater than had ev- CT before, in her whole annals, been derived from any single commodity. This she has done, first. by working it up for her own use upon the largest scale, and next making it subserve the interests of her foreign trade. She has seut it over all seas wherever mar ket opened but chiefly hack again to us, to be\n\n bought under the enhancements of her own labor at prices four and five fold those which she has paid us for it. Commerce, upon the\n\n terms attested by such facts, cannot be pro ] nounced just, as between the parties. The\n\n conviction is deeply entertained that the best\n\n interests of the nation point to the expedien- cy of reviewing and correcting species of\n\n commercial intercourse so unequal. It may be applicable to subjoin that the WOollen, cot ton, and iron goods, imported from all other\n\n parts ofthe world during the years indicated,\n\n are found to be but about one sixth part of the value of those obtained from the country.\n\n whose laws fall with edicts of exclusion. or\n\n whith such disproportionate duties on the\n\n produce of the U.

All the principal raw materials for\n\n carrying them on are at hand, or could be\n\n commanded. The skill for impapting excel\n\n lence to them would come at the proper time. There would be no want of labor: to which an abundant water power, as well as artificial machinery, would every where be endiug its assistance Capital would be found for n- vestment in them. If their establishment. by the immediate protection of the laws, should, at first raise the cost of the articles, &, for succession ofyears, keep it up,a true forecast, looking to the future, rather than adapting all it's calculations to the existing hour. would not hesitate to embrace the protecting policy. Nations that would found schemes, of solid and durable advantage, must he ready to do so at the peril of temporary privation. It is the great term of national, as of individual superiority and distinction. To buy cheap, is not the only, or always the chief good. It is for the Legislators, whO have to deal with the practical interests of mankind, to give to ab- stract propositions the necessity of limitations. Considerations, higher than those of present mercantile gain, have often swayed the coun- ses of nations ;-Of nations whose wisdom, in this respect, we ought not lightly to impugn, any more than we can at all question their long pre-eminence in prosperity. Need i, be said that England had her laws,t protect her tonnage, for more than century; during all which time, she might have employed the tonnage of other States, at price much be- low that at which she built and used her own!\n\n Need it be added what results, to her maratme and commercial sway, have flowed from her\n\n resOlute perseverance in those laws! Need it\n\n be said that France, conspicuous for positive\n\n riches, and comforts, and power, still excludes\n\n from her territory fabrcs that might trench upon the custom of her own workshops, in branches of labour and art, believed to\n\n be conducive to the national resources,\n\n whilst they confer, also, the means of in diyldual thrift? Shall the many laws of these two great States. at periods when they\n\n were laying the foundations of their manu-\n\n featuring industry, be recOunted, all tending to foster it, by inducements the most effica- cious-laws to the essential principle of which they still in so many instances systematically adhere. These, with analogous illustrations,as numerous as applicable, will be forborne. as too, familiar to be reeapitulated. The pro tecting laws to our own tonnage, our own cOasting trade, eur own fisheries. still in force, and which first raised up the prostrate navi- gation of the United States. may supercede other references. These show how the Fath- CTS of the Republic were awake to the wisdom of other times and other nations, knowing\n\n how to make 1t their own. Their recorded",

The situation\n\n of the United States locally the number and position of their posts along SD extended line of coast the tonnage of which they are actu- ! ally in possession, with the commercial expe-\n\n rience of their people, point them out as pe- ! culiarIy fitted to derive advantage from this system, and serve to recommend for 1t more liberal enactments than any of which it has yet been the subject. By our present laws the merchant is compelled to re-expOrt, with in twelvemonth, the foreign commodity he\n\n has imported. or lose the drawback. Hence,\n\n he loses all opportunity, after this time, of sending the commodity to seek foreign mar kets when the market at home may fail. The\n\n restriction put upon him in this respect, ought, 1 it is conceived to be done away, by extending the time during which he might exercise the\n\n right of re-exportation. At present, whenever 1 redundancy of foreign goods is seen in the 1 country, as will happen occasionally in all l trading countries, from the impossibty of adapting precisely the supply to the demand, 1 the excess fnOt sent abroad is thrown upon | the home market, at whatever reduction of 1 price. This operates to the injury both Ofthc home manufacturer and the importer. By l enlarging the time of re-exp0rtation, with l privilege of drawback, such excess, whenever\n\n existing, would be more likely to seek vent l in other countries, ,and with improved chances of finding it profitable. Should the wisdom l of Congress deem an alteration in the laws, with view to enlarge the privilege of re-ex- l portatiOn, expedient, an authority 10 build 1 additional warehouses in some of the plinci pal seaport towns will be necessary. The\n\n local accommodation for merchadize that ! must ge into store, under the existing laws, is | insufficient. Larger and better constructed edifices are required, even for the present | wants of our commerce. A commerce which l yields to the national treasury revenue of twenty millions of dollars year, under a ta- 1 riff far more moderate, even since 1924, than 1 that which has marked the career Ofany great\n\n state of modern times, is entitled to adequate and liberal provisions for its accommodation. Where interests are mutfarious, as in free, popu- lous and opulent communities must he the case, tue hand of Governmen: must be varously extended.-\n\n Sometimes it is wisely applied to the effective regua\n\n ton o some ot these interests, and sometimes It be-\n\n necessary tighten its pressure upon others\n\n Not only IS 1t mended lessen the restrictions ! which laws have so long imposed upon the mer-\n\n chant, in branch of the foreign trade, but\n\n IS also conceived that there articles entering n to the list of our imports the duties upon which it would be expedient to reduce Among these, it is 1 thought proper to mention Teas and Wines aS being l prominent.\n\n 1 The use of Tea has become so general throughout\n\n the United States to rank almost necessary ot l life. When to this add, that there is rival pro-\n\n ducon at hoe to be by lessenng the amount\n\n ofits importation the duty upon may safely be regar\n\n ded too big h.. Upon some of the varieties of the\n\n article, it considerably exceeds hundred per cent\n\n and believed to be generally above the level winch\n\n true policy points out. moderate reduction of the 1 duty would lead to increased consumption of the\n\n arice, to extent that, in all probability, would, in\n\n the end, benefit rather than injure the revenue Its tendency would be to enlarge trade in exports to China. 1t would cause more of the trade of teas to\n\n centre in ports the present rate of duty drl\n\n wing our tea ships not unfequeny to seek their mar kets m Europe It would also serve to diminish the risk ot the United States ultimately losing any portion of trade valuable, through the policy and regu4a tions of other nations.\n\n The duty upon wines is also believed to be higher than wse, commercial, and national policy dictates. The experience Of our well as other countries\n\n has shown, that high duties upon wines do not prove benehcIB to the revenue. General experience also\n\n shows that the consumption of wine tends to diminish\n\n the of ardent spirits. These inducements for\n\n keeping the duties upon wines low. Theyare strength\n\n ened by the consideration, that by lowering them | shall increase benefciaiy trade to the countries whence we obtain wines. Some of these countries\n\n unable to take productions unless their wines\n\n be received as an equivalent They are, at the same time, prepared to take them untrammeed by positive\n\n virtual prohibitions. It seems but just that should\n\n take freely the productions of nations that take\n\n freely. But in point of fact, the present rates of\n\n tariff favor mos many and essential things, the pro-\n\n ductlons of nations that favor least. The of duty upon wines IS not only in many instances very high, but very unequal regards the different de-\n\n scriptlon of wines and the countries producing them.\n\n The whole ject thought to demand revision. Up- on the superior wines of France and those of the Rhine, upon those generally of Spain, Portugal, the\n\n Italian States, and perhaps other cosnries, the\n\n duties, it is believed, might be advantageousy brought down. The manufacture of wine in the United States\n\n does not at this uncture, comprehend any such large\n\n interest to nterpose serons objections to the policy recommended. The opinion may also be hazarded\n\n that proportion the taste for wines to pre-\n\n vail that for ardent splrs under the encourage\n\n ment of low duties upon those imported from abroad,\n\n will better basis be laid for the prosecution fu\n\n ture day of this branch of industry at home.\n\n few remarks upon the state of the trade between\n\n the United States and the British Colonies since the\n\n nerdicton put upon by Great Britain will close the more general observations of this report.\n\n Sufficient time has scarcely elapsed to enable to\n\n determine, with precision, the that this trade\n\n will ultimately take, regards the ofsupples,\n\n the channel through which they will chiefly pass and\n\n the proportions of American and British tonnage like y to be employed in their transportation.

What will be the relative proportion of the tonnage of two nations ploycd in carrying this trade cannot at present be stated with confidence. IL is not probable that that of the United States will suffer, where the compet- ton can be made equal but 1t is possible that some dimuntion of their shipping may be eventually witt messed in favor of the flag ofsome third Power. It is the declared policy of Britain to produce such result rather than allow, by any arrangement which she can control the tonnage of nation, already as large as the United tates, tu become larger.

It may be repeated, however, that further time Is necessary for establishing definite conclusions upon this and the points adverted It IS ascerained that the imports into the U. States from the whole of the West India Islands, for the first six months of the present year, fall below the average rate of those of the first six months of the three years preceding including mportatons from tine Br Islands On the other hand, our exports to the whole of the West indies, during the first six months of l37 have exceeded their average amount for the period during the three years preceding, including the ports to the British Islands.\n\n The estimates, in detail, of the revenue for the ensuing year, will now be given. ..\n\n The gross amount of duties which accrued on ports and tonnage from the first of Jan the S0th Sept. last, is estimated 2l 226 000 dollars. The gross amount that will for the last quarter of the year, IS estimated ,000 dollars; making an aggregate of twentyseven millions for the entire year.\n\n The debentures for drawbacks issued during the three first quarters of the year, amount to and the amount outstanding the Both Sept. was $5l6,96 of which 245 67, chargeable upon the revenue of lS28-The amount of duty bonds in suit on the 30th yf Sept was 436,8l2, which is more by 28,929 than was in suit sane day last year.\n\n In estimating the probable amount of duties that will be received as compared with the gross amount secured on the mporaons of the year, the necessary deductions to be made only for drawbacks but for the expenses of eoecon and various losses that may happen.

The\n\n increase of our imports and exports since the\n\n Tariff of 1924, becomes the more striking from the consideration that in 1926 there was witnessed in Europe an extraordinary de- pression of prices. This was follo-ed by proportionate stagnation in all the operations of purchase and sale.

A change since 1924, in he laws of Great Britain in regard to those. first named, has also rendered almost abOr- tive the provisions of the tariff in their favor It belongs to the purpose Of this Report,\n\n which looks to the encouragement ofthe na-\n\n tional industry in preference to any that IS fo- reign, here to state, that for period Of three years, ending with 1926, the value of cotton\n\n and woolIen goods, imported into the United States from the country just named, exceeds\n\n one hundred millions of dollars; and the val\n\n ue of iron and of articles manufactured from iron, seventeen millions. During one of these years the wOoll~ns exported from that cOun- try to this exceeds he amount ot those ex- ported to the whole of Europe put together.\n\n For the means of exchange against an amount of foreign manufactures so great, the United States have had these. principle staples of their 1Oil, viz wheat, flour, tobacco and cotton. The first of these, the same country\n\n has, by her laws, positively or virtually exclu- ded durug the same period Of years from consumption within her dOminions. The se- cond she has admitted, under duty of more than six hundrcdp per cent. The third she has i received with Iittle scruple. She has known how to convert it into means of wealth to her own industrious people, greater than had ev- CT before, in her whole annals, been derived from any single commodity. This she has done, first. by working it up for her own use upon the largest scale, and next making it subserve the interests of her foreign trade. She has seut it over all seas wherever mar ket opened but chiefly hack again to us, to be\n\n bought under the enhancements of her own labor at prices four and five fold those which she has paid us for it. Commerce, upon the\n\n terms attested by such facts, cannot be pro ] nounced just, as between the parties. The\n\n conviction is deeply entertained that the best\n\n interests of the nation point to the expedien- cy of reviewing and correcting species of\n\n commercial intercourse so unequal. It may be applicable to subjoin that the WOollen, cot ton, and iron goods, imported from all other\n\n parts ofthe world during the years indicated,\n\n are found to be but about one sixth part of the value of those obtained from the country.\n\n whose laws fall with edicts of exclusion. or\n\n whith such disproportionate duties on the\n\n produce of the U. States not only the articles\n\n mentioned, but more that might be mention\n\n ed.\n\n The complete establishment of American Manufactures in Wool, Cotton, Iron & Hemp, is believed to be of very high moment to the nation. All the principal raw materials for\n\n carrying them on are at hand, or could be\n\n commanded. The skill for impapting excel\n\n lence to them would come at the proper time. There would be no want of labor: to which an abundant water power, as well as artificial machinery, would every where be endiug its assistance Capital would be found for n- vestment in them. If their establishment. by the immediate protection of the laws, should, at first raise the cost of the articles, &, for succession ofyears, keep it up,a true forecast, looking to the future, rather than adapting all it's calculations to the existing hour. would not hesitate to embrace the protecting policy. Nations that would found schemes, of solid and durable advantage, must he ready to do so at the peril of temporary privation. It is the great term of national, as of individual superiority and distinction. To buy cheap, is not the only, or always the chief good. It is for the Legislators, whO have to deal with the practical interests of mankind, to give to ab- stract propositions the necessity of limitations. Considerations, higher than those of present mercantile gain, have often swayed the coun- ses of nations ;-Of nations whose wisdom, in this respect, we ought not lightly to impugn, any more than we can at all question their long pre-eminence in prosperity. Need i, be said that England had her laws,t protect her tonnage, for more than century; during all which time, she might have employed the tonnage of other States, at price much be- low that at which she built and used her own!\n\n Need it be added what results, to her maratme and commercial sway, have flowed from her\n\n resOlute perseverance in those laws! Need it\n\n be said that France, conspicuous for positive\n\n riches, and comforts, and power, still excludes\n\n from her territory fabrcs that might trench upon the custom of her own workshops, in branches of labour and art, believed to\n\n be conducive to the national resources,\n\n whilst they confer, also, the means of in diyldual thrift? Shall the many laws of these two great States. at periods when they\n\n were laying the foundations of their manu-\n\n featuring industry, be recOunted, all tending to foster it, by inducements the most effica- cious-laws to the essential principle of which they still in so many instances systematically adhere. These, with analogous illustrations,as numerous as applicable, will be forborne. as too, familiar to be reeapitulated. The pro tecting laws to our own tonnage, our own cOasting trade, eur own fisheries. still in force, and which first raised up the prostrate navi- gation of the United States. may supercede other references.

The situation\n\n of the United States locally the number and position of their posts along SD extended line of coast the tonnage of which they are actu- ! ally in possession, with the commercial expe-\n\n rience of their people, point them out as pe- ! culiarIy fitted to derive advantage from this system, and serve to recommend for 1t more liberal enactments than any of which it has yet been the subject. By our present laws the merchant is compelled to re-expOrt, with in twelvemonth, the foreign commodity he\n\n has imported. or lose the drawback. Hence,\n\n he loses all opportunity, after this time, of sending the commodity to seek foreign mar kets when the market at home may fail. The\n\n restriction put upon him in this respect, ought, 1 it is conceived to be done away, by extending the time during which he might exercise the\n\n right of re-exportation. At present, whenever 1 redundancy of foreign goods is seen in the 1 country, as will happen occasionally in all l trading countries, from the impossibty of adapting precisely the supply to the demand, 1 the excess fnOt sent abroad is thrown upon | the home market, at whatever reduction of 1 price. This operates to the injury both Ofthc home manufacturer and the importer. By l enlarging the time of re-exp0rtation, with l privilege of drawback, such excess, whenever\n\n existing, would be more likely to seek vent l in other countries, ,and with improved chances of finding it profitable. Should the wisdom l of Congress deem an alteration in the laws, with view to enlarge the privilege of re-ex- l portatiOn, expedient, an authority 10 build 1 additional warehouses in some of the plinci pal seaport towns will be necessary. The\n\n local accommodation for merchadize that ! must ge into store, under the existing laws, is | insufficient. Larger and better constructed edifices are required, even for the present | wants of our commerce. A commerce which l yields to the national treasury revenue of twenty millions of dollars year, under a ta- 1 riff far more moderate, even since 1924, than 1 that which has marked the career Ofany great\n\n state of modern times, is entitled to adequate and liberal provisions for its accommodation. Where interests are mutfarious, as in free, popu- lous and opulent communities must he the case, tue hand of Governmen: must be varously extended.-\n\n Sometimes it is wisely applied to the effective regua\n\n ton o some ot these interests, and sometimes It be-\n\n necessary tighten its pressure upon others\n\n Not only IS 1t mended lessen the restrictions ! which laws have so long imposed upon the mer-\n\n chant, in branch of the foreign trade, but\n\n IS also conceived that there articles entering n to the list of our imports the duties upon which it would be expedient to reduce Among these, it is 1 thought proper to mention Teas and Wines aS being l prominent.\n\n 1 The use of Tea has become so general throughout\n\n the United States to rank almost necessary ot l life. When to this add, that there is rival pro-\n\n ducon at hoe to be by lessenng the amount\n\n ofits importation the duty upon may safely be regar\n\n ded too big h.. Upon some of the varieties of the\n\n article, it considerably exceeds hundred per cent\n\n and believed to be generally above the level winch\n\n true policy points out. moderate reduction of the 1 duty would lead to increased consumption of the\n\n arice, to extent that, in all probability, would, in\n\n the end, benefit rather than injure the revenue Its tendency would be to enlarge trade in exports to China. 1t would cause more of the trade of teas to\n\n centre in ports the present rate of duty drl\n\n wing our tea ships not unfequeny to seek their mar kets m Europe It would also serve to diminish the risk ot the United States ultimately losing any portion of trade valuable, through the policy and regu4a tions of other nations.\n\n The duty upon wines is also believed to be higher than wse, commercial, and national policy dictates. The experience Of our well as other countries\n\n has shown, that high duties upon wines do not prove benehcIB to the revenue. General experience also\n\n shows that the consumption of wine tends to diminish\n\n the of ardent spirits. These inducements for\n\n keeping the duties upon wines low. Theyare strength\n\n ened by the consideration, that by lowering them | shall increase benefciaiy trade to the countries whence we obtain wines. Some of these countries\n\n unable to take productions unless their wines\n\n be received as an equivalent They are, at the same time, prepared to take them untrammeed by positive\n\n virtual prohibitions. It seems but just that should\n\n take freely the productions of nations that take\n\n freely. But in point of fact, the present rates of\n\n tariff favor mos many and essential things, the pro-\n\n ductlons of nations that favor least. The of duty upon wines IS not only in many instances very high, but very unequal regards the different de-\n\n scriptlon of wines and the countries producing them.\n\n The whole ject thought to demand revision. Up- on the superior wines of France and those of the Rhine, upon those generally of Spain, Portugal, the\n\n Italian States, and perhaps other cosnries, the\n\n duties, it is believed, might be advantageousy brought down. The manufacture of wine in the United States\n\n does not at this uncture, comprehend any such large\n\n interest to nterpose serons objections to the policy recommended. The opinion may also be hazarded\n\n that proportion the taste for wines to pre-\n\n vail that for ardent splrs under the encourage\n\n ment of low duties upon those imported from abroad,\n\n will better basis be laid for the prosecution fu\n\n ture day of this branch of industry at home.\n\n few remarks upon the state of the trade between\n\n the United States and the British Colonies since the\n\n nerdicton put upon by Great Britain will close the more general observations of this report.\n\n Sufficient time has scarcely elapsed to enable to\n\n determine, with precision, the that this trade\n\n will ultimately take, regards the ofsupples,\n\n the channel through which they will chiefly pass and\n\n the proportions of American and British tonnage like y to be employed in their transportation.
