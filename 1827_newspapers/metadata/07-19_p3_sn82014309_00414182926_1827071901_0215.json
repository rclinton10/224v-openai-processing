GreQt Fish Story.--A Eew-Haven paper says, that 7 large sharks were taken insthat harbor July I'd, at one haul, in sen for taking white fish, The haul also brought in % 000 white fish; although most that were caught escaped in consequence of the injury the net sustained by the sharks. 1 Tremendous Hwrscnne.-The Vincennes, (Indiana) paper states that destructive hurricane, accompani- ed with hail. was experienced in that country on the every thing that lay in its range pfosrated to the ground The effects of the storm are almost incredi- ble some of the hail-stones picked up, it is stated weighed ten ounces each! l The Globe Tavern in Augusta, Ga. was consumed by fire the night of the first inst. Among the items of loss menoned we observe the whole of the prop. erty of the Georgia Religious Tract Society, which had a depository in one of the lower rooms of the building. The amount of Tracts consumed was 350,- GOO pagcs-thc loss not great in itself considered cept that the demaad for these publications is now said to be increasing in that vicinity, and the onpor tunities for profitable distribution of them very nu- mcrous.\n\n The Fifty-frst Anniversary of American Indepen- dcnce appears to have been celebrated in New-Eng- land with very little noise and parade, although doubt not with much more propriey, and consequent- ly with better effect than the day has been heretofore honoured. In most of our large towns religious and moral services took the place of rotous eating and drinking, with great majority ofthe inhabitants: and\n\n in some of them other services appear to have been announced. The mighty efforts which were formerly\n\n ncde monifnst inv the this by showy and boistcrous demonstrations of gratitude appear to have been neglected this year, and quie, congratulations each other the return of the an niversary and ascrptons of praise Heaven for the blessings oIndependcnce wcre adopted in their stead l by very large share of the community.\n\n 1 The Twenty-eighth Anniversary of the London Re ligious Tract Society celebrated on the 18th oi May at the city of London Tavern. The great room for meeting was filled to overaowing by five o'clock\n\n in the morning. and at six the lord Mayor arrived and took the chair and the services of the meeting were l immediately commenced. From an abstract of the Annual Report, published in the N. Y. Observer, i, appears that the publications of this Society have been circulated in almost all parts of the known world pre-. senting the eyes of the deluded votares of idoar the glorious truths of the gospel in inviting orm well alluring tbe aged and the young in Christian lands from the destructive paths of vice the pursuit of virtue and happiness. One circumstance of pecul- ,ar interest occurred at this meeting Inan interval between two of the speeches, of which several were made, the lord mayor arose and said that Git was with no ordinary feelings he broke in upon the order of the meeting; but account had that moment reach ed him that the kne of death had just toled the tomb ofthe Rev. and venerable author of the Dairy. man's Daughtrr and several other tracts,-that the Rev. LEIGH RICHMOND, late Secretary ofths Society was now gathered to his rest\" His lordahip then made an affecting appeal to the old and the yoang to stances were awa sudden in which both were alike annunciaton of the death of this excellent man. at such time, must have created strong emotions o l sympathy in every feeling heart. The Dairyman's Daughter is probably one of the best tracts pub\n\n shed. It has carried conviction as well as consola\n\n ton to the heart of thousands, and will be read with profit and delight so long as the benign influence o { the gospel shah affect the human mind.\n\n DE7ED\n\n At Little Falls, N.

From an abstract of the Annual Report, published in the N. Y. Observer, i, appears that the publications of this Society have been circulated in almost all parts of the known world pre-. senting the eyes of the deluded votares of idoar the glorious truths of the gospel in inviting orm well alluring tbe aged and the young in Christian lands from the destructive paths of vice the pursuit of virtue and happiness. One circumstance of pecul- ,ar interest occurred at this meeting Inan interval between two of the speeches, of which several were made, the lord mayor arose and said that Git was with no ordinary feelings he broke in upon the order of the meeting; but account had that moment reach ed him that the kne of death had just toled the tomb ofthe Rev. and venerable author of the Dairy. man's Daughtrr and several other tracts,-that the Rev.

The unseemliness of the depoFt- ment is enhanced by the injustice of the sentiment; for knows better than Mir. Giles, that the Pres ident of the United States never \"has claimed any political power from the author of our existance, as paramount to our Constitution\" No man knows bet ter than Mr. Giles, that the President meant convey no such idea, that he derived power from above, and not from the people and Constitution of his try. No man knows better than our Governor, that what the President did mean, that he felt hound to reverence the oath he had taken before God to support the constitution, above all human rcqusition Is not this correct sentiment ?-Why cndeavour to torture plain and correct sentiment, into a trea- sonable meaning Why,butthat it gave his Excellency an opportunity of cvincng the undyng hatred he feels towards the President, in common with all who have outstrippcd him in the race of political preferment?\n\n The National Inteltigencer of Friday contains the following account of the celebration of the Fourth Washington.\n\n \"The National Anniversary was celebrated in this city on \"Wednesday last, with all the customary marks of respect and with every indication of joyous faction. \"An:oration was pronounced by Richard s. Coxe Esq. presceded by prayer by Dr. Laurie, and the reading of the Declaration of IndependCnce by.Dr. Thomas Sim. These ceremonies were attended by the President of the United States and other officers of the Government, and by the Foreign Functona- ries at present in the city, and were impressive as they were appropriate. @. &. ''Whie these cerimonles were proceeding in the church, the military companies had joined their in tercsting Military visitors in the grove of the Pres dents Square; wherelthe whole were Lberally serv. ed with refreshments from the Presidents Mansion which the heat of the day. the length and excessive dustiness of the march, made extremely acceptable. We are glad in particular, to see how mnutcly the comfort of hesstranger company was attended to by 1 the Presidents orders.\n\n \"After the procession had returned from the Church the Presidents house thrown open, and he as u- sua receivedthe saiutations of large number of his fellow citizens and many ladies; besides we are sor- ry to add, mob of all sizes and almost of all colOrs, that should not be admitted\"\n\n IS hardly necessary for us to state that we do not consider ourselves responsible for the sentiments advan- ced in the political articles which it is necessary to publish from time to time preserve the chain of intelligence unbroken. There are, for example, in the toasts drunk at the Vanxhall Dinner, sundry hits and slashes at the Hartford Convention.

Jackson. As leader of armies, arbter upon the lives of his fellow men, citizen, seeking his interest and prOs- periy, he has appeared to bid defiance to the good or bad opinion which others might form of him. A fear that his motives would be misconstrued if he opposed Mir. Clay not the principle which indu- ced him vote he did. If such the fact, he is in twofold unfit for the presidency. No, the truth s this friend of his who intimated to him that corrupt bargain going on between Mir. Adams and Mr. Clay, and advised him accept of certain tures and thus by corruption defeat corruption, supposed by him to speak without authority, and his dark nsinuations were consideredas the idle offspring of political jealousy, and of course disregarded; and we arc very much mistaken if the Geneaal does not soon learn that had been better for hi had he to this day manifested the same disregard to these groundless charges of corruption, instead of becoming himself the principal acccuser of his political oppo- nents.\n\n This letter is not in itself direct charge against Mr. Adams and Mir.

This must lead to the augmentation of the British troops in Portugal the fate of that Kingdom must be left to the decision of the French and Span- sh armies All the late seem to agree in rep- resenting the affairs of Portugal in melancholy light.
