We must\nagain observe that our object is not to notice the\nCorporaFs personal abuse of ourselves. This we\ndisregard, feeling satisfied that his blackguardism\ncannot injure any person. We wish now to call\nour readers to the cowardly manner in which the\nCorporal attempts to make his escape from the\nunpleasant situation in which he has been placed\nby our recent exposure of his inconsistency. A\ndoughty little fellow like him, who talks about\nshouldering his rifle, and has boasted of his militia\n~ exploits during the late war, ought to be ashamed\nto sneak oft in such a manner. You must come\nback, Corporal. We cannot suffer you to get out\nOF the scrape, by swearing that you will not again\nnotice US. No, no-this will not do. You must act\nmore like man More like what you profess to\nbean honorable mana man of valor. Your\nmere denial OF our charge, and yonr refusal to ac.\ncept of challenge, cannot save you. Even\n\n\n\n\n\nyour want of candor and magnanmity in this af-\nfair. Some of them are laughing at you. Others\ndespise you for your cowardice. Had YOU come\nout at first like an honest man, and given your\nreasons for the change in your opinion of General\nJackson, offered satisfactory plea for your for\nmer abuse, and present support, of him, you might\nhave been preserved from those mortifyng feelings\nwhich have emblttered your mind and rendered\nyou reckless of decency and truth.\n\n\ntbok 49,.\nguilty of misrepresenting MIR. Harker's sentiments\nrespecting Gen. Jackson, in the quotation which\nwe have several times made from the Delaware Ga\nzettc of Nov. /, 1922. In that paper, which may\nbe seen at this office, Mr.. Harker says, that when\ncertain points substantiated, we may be bet\nter able to Judge OF the relative claims of the ssve-\nrat candidates.\" These s. several candidates.\nwere Messrs, Clay, Clinton, Jackson, Adams, Cal\nhoun, and Crawford, whose names he had just be-\nfore mentioned in the same article from which our\nquotation is made. He then proceeds to say that\n\n\n\"Of ALL the gentlemen named Gen. Jaekssn appears\nto be the MOST OBJECTIONABLE. That he is\na Of energy, will doubt but we think that\nin chief magistrate of the United States, much en-\neryy extremely dangerous; AND have IN THE\nGENERAL such DISREGARD FOR THE INSTITU-\nTloNS of the country, such DISPOSITION TO place\nhimself ABOVE ITS la1vs, AND such an INCLINATION 10\nTRAMPLE ON THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS, when\nthey stood in composition with HIS OWN INTEREST or\nFEELINGS, as should render the citizens of the United\nStates pery cautious about placing him in the first office\nwithin their gift.''\n\n\nfive are guilty of fmisrepresenting MIR. Harker's\nsentiments, how easy is it for him to prove US so,\nby repubishing the article which contains the above\nextract. This we dare him to do. Although we\nbelieve he cannot muster courage sufficient to ac\ncept the challenge, we will wait little longer with\nhim, still intending to republish it ourselves, at\nsuch time as we may deem expedient.",
