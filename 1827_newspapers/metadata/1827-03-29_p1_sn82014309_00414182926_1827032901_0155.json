We have killed great number of them, and on our side we have lost our brother Giovani Suitana. On the 29th ut. we directed our oh to this place for the purpose of joining the other corps at Thistimo. We sent forward the Captains Gardickittis, Grivas, and Kiaya, with 300 men, with orders to possess themselves of Arakova. So soon as this advance guard informed us that they were in sight of the enemy, we left Thstimo with the Souliot chiefs, Ipsariots, and others; and I sent the different corps under Christothulo, Pe- tro, and Galoni, by cross road, to Ara kova, that they might reach that place as soon as possible. On the first, we attack ed the enemy, and a desperate battle ensu- ed. which lasted five hours. The enemy, after having lost great number of men, and leaving every thing behind them, reti- red to disadvantageous position, where we kept them five days at bey. They pro- posed that we should allow them to affect a complete retreat, but we sent them word that they might now do with us as we had done with them at Missolongh. This day we dislodged them from their position, for ced them to action, killed 1900 men, a. mong whom the Kiaya Bey, Moustapha Bey, and two other Beys, and took several prisoners whom we shall immediately send of to Napoli. Among the latter are sey- eral persons of distinction. Our brave tel- lows have all enriched themselves with the money. richly mounted arms, and costly clothes of the Mahometans. Rejoice, my brothers the continental part of our coun- try has got completely rid of the enemy since the flower of the Albanian Turks arc destroyed.

And who are the men who compose the combination Men who are seeking office-one is to be Secretary of State, another of War-another of the Navy-another of the Treasury-This one is to go Minister to England-that one to France.-This expectation of office-this hope of preference from Gen. Jackson, flattered by his confidential friends-tAis is the cement which binds together hetero- geneous mass called the opposition.-This IS the principle of those \"combinations which are nearly completed to elect Gen. Jackson\" This is at the bottom of all the sentimental patriotism so abundantly uttered by the tongue!-Rich. Whig.

Nine were l5 months old, and ten months old.\n\n In Randolph, Vermont, a boy named Belknap aged l7, has committed matrimo- ny; the happy fair one is Miss Sprague, his junior by couple of years. Paternal government must be rather lax in that State.\n\n Great Rail Road.-The Legislature of Maryland have incorporated company under the title of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company, with capital of $3 ,OOO,OOO, to construct a rail road from Baltimore to the Ohio-a distance in the shortest line of about $50 miles. The Corporation of Baltimore are expected to subscribe for half million of the stock one branch of the City Council having al- ready passed a res olution, which will, it is said, have the confirmation of the other branch, authorizing such subscription. The State reserves to itself the right to subscribe million of dollars.\n\n The Legislature of Virginia have con- frmcd this act of Maryland, so far as it is to take effect within the limits of Virginia, stipulating only, that the rail road shall not strike the Ohio below the Little kenha- wa, and that no lateral roads shall be con- structed in Virginia without the consent of the Legislature. Iti expected that Penn sylvania also, will as far as the contempla- ted road may trench upon her southern boundary, ratify the act of Maryland.\n\n This is cerainly very magnificent pro- ject; perhaps feasible within the amount of capital named. We say, however, per- haps-for nature has intcrposed between the Atlantic and western waters, the great range of the Alleghany mountains-which are to be travcrsed, or penetrated, by this rail road.\n\n The Baltimore papers cxult much, as if it can be carried into execution-they just ly may, at the prospects of benefit to their city from this undertaking. We wish their utmost hopes may be roalised-satis6ed that it will, like all other such schemes, when wisely planned and executed, con- duce to the general good.-N. Y. Amer.",

Floyd, member of Congress from Virginia, read before the Virginia legislature, he declined the office of Governor rendered to him by his friends Giving as reason, that\n\n e. \"Combinations for efecting the el- eration of Gen. Jackson, ,Oere nearly con,- plete, and that he vished to remain m Congress ~ntH they aoere complete. \"~O\n\n Combinations-anda among whom The People No-but the members of Con- gress. Take notice, gentle reader, that these are not combinations between Adams and Clay-they are combinations among those pure and immaculate gentlemen, who have denounced all combinations, as cheat ing the people-who call the serving ofMr. Clay under MT. Adams, the coalition of the puritan and the black leg-and who presuming combination between them for the purpose of electing the late President of tho United States, have applied to his phantom every term of moral and polit- ical reproduction. We find that these same pure and immaculate gentlemen--these virtuous patriots, who were fired with so holy an indignation at this supposed fraud upon the popular will, are by the confess sion of so important member of their par ty as Dr. Floyd, combined and for the same purpose of making President. \"The combinations for electing Gen. Jackson are nearly complete\" So the people, notwithstanding the solicitude for their rights, and the denunciations against Mes SITS. Adams and Clay for their alleged dis respect of their will by Dr. Floyd and his associates, are after all to have nothing to do with the election That is to be settled by combinations among the members of Congress-and this is avowed by so dis tinguished member as Dr. Floyd--he whose presence is necessary at Washing ton, to save the nation It was infamous in MT. Clay to exercise his constitutional discression in voting for Adams in prefer encc to Jackson, after the people had fail- ed to make choice-but it is all right to elect Jackson by combination among the members of Congress, without at all con- sulting the people. It was bargain, sale corruption in Clay, tevote as his District wished him, and as his State was willing he should vote, but it is perfectly fair, nay highly meritorious and patriotic in Dr. Floyd and his associates, exercising their opportunities and influence as Members of Congress, to combine to elect Jackson. That Mir. Clay should be reconciled to MT. Adams, whom he had only differed but on the subject of the Mississippi and fisheries, politically and never personally, was irrefragable evidence of their corrup- ton, of bargain and sale-but when Mir. Calhoun and MT. Randolph, Gen. Jack son and Col. Benton, MT. Calhoun and Dr. Floyd are reconciled-men whose long and rancorous mutual hatred is noto- rious-and when a close intimacy succeeds for the purpose of effecting common end, all this is complimented as magnanimous proceeding.\n\n ', ;s t;rna that the neonle were lookinp",

The girl did as she was ordered, and about noon gave the three children some of it. 1 The children almost immediately after swallowing the soup, sickened and died.-- This had such an effect upon the girl, that she ran screening till she met her mistress, who hastened home and found that her girl was not crazy as she imagined, when she beheld her three infants lying lifeless.

All the news we have received, indirectly, ,how- ever, through France and Spain, tends strongly to prove the hopeless dispersion and defeat of the apostolical rebels. The battle of Cornoches de Beira is stated to have been for some time warmly contest ed and the success of the royalists to have been, at last owing to a report, (how or iginated, or how circulated, during the heat of battle, does not appear,) that the English troops, after their landing, had im- mediately marched for Beira, and were al- most close at hand. Upon this notion get ting ground, the officers immediately be- took themselves to flight, and large DOT tOA Ol WCAt ONCl tO lAlC NOH\" tinential army. After tho battle, the news of amnesty being published by the Regent induced still larger number, indeed al- most the whole corps of Magessi, one of the rebel commanders, to the Court de Villa Flor. The remainder took refuge in tho Spanish territory.\n\n Of the manner in which they were there received, the accounts are by no means clear. Some state that they were supplied with arms and amuniton, and e. ven that large sum of money was imme- diatly sent off from Madrid, for the pur- pose to enable them to make second inva- sion which indeed is alledged to have ta- ken place. It is, in fact, probable, that some of these refugees have again crossed Duro, and thus entered the province oi Tras os Montes but there is little proba- bility of their being in much force, or, con- sidering the way in which opinion must now be operating in favor of the constitu- tional cause, of their murders receiving much accession.\n\n On the other hand, M. Salmon, ,the Span ish minister for foreign affairs, is stated tc have addressed an official note to MT. Lamb the British Ambassador, represented\"That his Catholic Majesty has seen, with the utmost indignation, the conduct recently pursued by Gen. Longa and by the Gov ernor of Ciudad Rodrigo, who, in contra vention of the orders which had Eeen sent to disarm the Portugnes rebels who had re- entered the Spanish territory, and to di- rect them to the interior, 40 leagues from the frontier, have manifested so little zea in fulfilling the directions of his Majesty that the refugees who entered on the 12tl inst. at different points on the banks of thu Torneo, had been suffered to repass tho Douro, by the Hinajoso and Friexenda and to re-enter the Portuguese province O Tras os Monies and that in consequence of theSe occlrrenceS Gen.

Clay--they mean to take the election of President into their own hands, and cheat the people with nomin- al instrumentality. And who are the men who compose the combination Men who are seeking office-one is to be Secretary of State, another of War-another of the Navy-another of the Treasury-This one is to go Minister to England-that one to France.-This expectation of office-this hope of preference from Gen. Jackson, flattered by his confidential friends-tAis is the cement which binds together hetero- geneous mass called the opposition.-This IS the principle of those \"combinations which are nearly completed to elect Gen. Jackson\" This is at the bottom of all the sentimental patriotism so abundantly uttered by the tongue!-Rich. Whig. A SOW belonging to Mr.P Preserved Bart lett, of Northampton Mass, had 35 pigs 6 litters) in 13 months. Nineteen of these were butchered in January last and sold for $299, 50. Nine were l5 months old, and ten months old.\n\n In Randolph, Vermont, a boy named Belknap aged l7, has committed matrimo- ny; the happy fair one is Miss Sprague, his junior by couple of years. Paternal government must be rather lax in that State.\n\n Great Rail Road.-The Legislature of Maryland have incorporated company under the title of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company, with capital of $3 ,OOO,OOO, to construct a rail road from Baltimore to the Ohio-a distance in the shortest line of about $50 miles. The Corporation of Baltimore are expected to subscribe for half million of the stock one branch of the City Council having al- ready passed a res olution, which will, it is said, have the confirmation of the other branch, authorizing such subscription. The State reserves to itself the right to subscribe million of dollars.\n\n The Legislature of Virginia have con- frmcd this act of Maryland, so far as it is to take effect within the limits of Virginia, stipulating only, that the rail road shall not strike the Ohio below the Little kenha- wa, and that no lateral roads shall be con- structed in Virginia without the consent of the Legislature. Iti expected that Penn sylvania also, will as far as the contempla- ted road may trench upon her southern boundary, ratify the act of Maryland.\n\n This is cerainly very magnificent pro- ject; perhaps feasible within the amount of capital named. We say, however, per- haps-for nature has intcrposed between the Atlantic and western waters, the great range of the Alleghany mountains-which are to be travcrsed, or penetrated, by this rail road.\n\n The Baltimore papers cxult much, as if it can be carried into execution-they just ly may, at the prospects of benefit to their city from this undertaking. We wish their utmost hopes may be roalised-satis6ed that it will, like all other such schemes, when wisely planned and executed, con- duce to the general good.-N. Y. Amer.",

Jackson, ,Oere nearly con,- plete, and that he vished to remain m Congress ~ntH they aoere complete. \"~O\n\n Combinations-anda among whom The People No-but the members of Con- gress. Take notice, gentle reader, that these are not combinations between Adams and Clay-they are combinations among those pure and immaculate gentlemen, who have denounced all combinations, as cheat ing the people-who call the serving ofMr. Clay under MT. Adams, the coalition of the puritan and the black leg-and who presuming combination between them for the purpose of electing the late President of tho United States, have applied to his phantom every term of moral and polit- ical reproduction. We find that these same pure and immaculate gentlemen--these virtuous patriots, who were fired with so holy an indignation at this supposed fraud upon the popular will, are by the confess sion of so important member of their par ty as Dr. Floyd, combined and for the same purpose of making President. \"The combinations for electing Gen. Jackson are nearly complete\" So the people, notwithstanding the solicitude for their rights, and the denunciations against Mes SITS. Adams and Clay for their alleged dis respect of their will by Dr. Floyd and his associates, are after all to have nothing to do with the election That is to be settled by combinations among the members of Congress-and this is avowed by so dis tinguished member as Dr. Floyd--he whose presence is necessary at Washing ton, to save the nation It was infamous in MT. Clay to exercise his constitutional discression in voting for Adams in prefer encc to Jackson, after the people had fail- ed to make choice-but it is all right to elect Jackson by combination among the members of Congress, without at all con- sulting the people. It was bargain, sale corruption in Clay, tevote as his District wished him, and as his State was willing he should vote, but it is perfectly fair, nay highly meritorious and patriotic in Dr. Floyd and his associates, exercising their opportunities and influence as Members of Congress, to combine to elect Jackson. That Mir. Clay should be reconciled to MT. Adams, whom he had only differed but on the subject of the Mississippi and fisheries, politically and never personally, was irrefragable evidence of their corrup- ton, of bargain and sale-but when Mir. Calhoun and MT. Randolph, Gen. Jack son and Col. Benton, MT. Calhoun and Dr. Floyd are reconciled-men whose long and rancorous mutual hatred is noto- rious-and when a close intimacy succeeds for the purpose of effecting common end, all this is complimented as magnanimous proceeding.\n\n ', ;s t;rna that the neonle were lookinp",

All the news we have received, indirectly, ,how- ever, through France and Spain, tends strongly to prove the hopeless dispersion and defeat of the apostolical rebels. The battle of Cornoches de Beira is stated to have been for some time warmly contest ed and the success of the royalists to have been, at last owing to a report, (how or iginated, or how circulated, during the heat of battle, does not appear,) that the English troops, after their landing, had im- mediately marched for Beira, and were al- most close at hand. Upon this notion get ting ground, the officers immediately be- took themselves to flight, and large DOT tOA Ol WCAt ONCl tO lAlC NOH\" tinential army. After tho battle, the news of amnesty being published by the Regent induced still larger number, indeed al- most the whole corps of Magessi, one of the rebel commanders, to the Court de Villa Flor. The remainder took refuge in tho Spanish territory.\n\n Of the manner in which they were there received, the accounts are by no means clear. Some state that they were supplied with arms and amuniton, and e. ven that large sum of money was imme- diatly sent off from Madrid, for the pur- pose to enable them to make second inva- sion which indeed is alledged to have ta- ken place. It is, in fact, probable, that some of these refugees have again crossed Duro, and thus entered the province oi Tras os Montes but there is little proba- bility of their being in much force, or, con- sidering the way in which opinion must now be operating in favor of the constitu- tional cause, of their murders receiving much accession.\n\n On the other hand, M. Salmon, ,the Span ish minister for foreign affairs, is stated tc have addressed an official note to MT. Lamb the British Ambassador, represented\"That his Catholic Majesty has seen, with the utmost indignation, the conduct recently pursued by Gen. Longa and by the Gov ernor of Ciudad Rodrigo, who, in contra vention of the orders which had Eeen sent to disarm the Portugnes rebels who had re- entered the Spanish territory, and to di- rect them to the interior, 40 leagues from the frontier, have manifested so little zea in fulfilling the directions of his Majesty that the refugees who entered on the 12tl inst. at different points on the banks of thu Torneo, had been suffered to repass tho Douro, by the Hinajoso and Friexenda and to re-enter the Portuguese province O Tras os Monies and that in consequence of theSe occlrrenceS Gen.
