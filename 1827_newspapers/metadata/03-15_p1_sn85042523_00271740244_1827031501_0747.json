It is written with\nSO much simplicity and spirit, that we can\nnot doubt the following translation will be\nhighly acceptable to our readers.\n\n\n\"Macon, pretty little town, which is now\ntolerably well peopled, was not in existence\neighteen months ago. 1t seems to have aris.\nEll from the forests as by enchantment. 1t\nis civil spot, lost amid the still immense\ndomains of thu first children Of America.\nAbout league thence we are in the bosom\nof virgin forests, and the tops of the trees\nwhich seem as old as the world hang over\nour heads.

They accuse\ntheir chiefs Of having betrayed them in max\ning this cession, and we are assured, that ii\nhas already cost the life of Macintosh, one\nof the slgners of the treaty.\n\n\nWe passed the night at the Indian Agen\nev--the habitatinn was deserted. For fifty\nwears the name of General Lafayette had\n| lived among them by tradition, and an hun\ndred Indians had waited to receive us; but\nthe delays which we experienced during oul\nrout having tired their patience, they had\ngone elsewhere to prepare reception.

We arrived at\nhabltation a little better than that of the\nwatch. 1t was group of cabins construct\ned with the bodies of ftrecs placed over each\nother and stripped of their bark-The host\nwas an American, who by reverse of for\ntune had been forced to take refuge in this\nplace, where he made a pretty lucrative\ncommerce, exchanging fur skins furnished\nby the Indians for commodities brought from\nthe civilized countries. His little farm was\ncomposed of some we'll cultivated acres, of\nwell furnished poultry yard, and the habi-\ntation have described. At our arrival we\nfound two Indians seated before the door,\none young, the other grown up man, and\nboth Of remarkable form and beauty. They\nwere clothed with short tunic of light and\ntringed stuff, fastened round their bodies by\ngirdle embroidered with small beads of\nthousand colors-A shawl oflively color was\nrolled round their heads with much ele-\ngance. Their trowsers of sheep skins reached\ndown to their knees. They rose at the ap-\nproach of the general, saluted him, and the\nYoungest, to our great astonishment, compl-\nmented him in very good English. We soon\nlearned that he had passed his youth in .\ncollege in the United Sta, es, but that he had\nstolen away many years ago from benefac-\ntor to return to his brothers, whose life he\npreferred to that of civilized men. The\nGeneral put many questions to him upon the\nexistence of the Indian colony. He replied\nTO them with much sense and precision\nWhen he was questioned as to the last trea-\nty concluded with the United States, his\n\n\ncountenance darkened, he struck his foot\n\n\non the grountl, and laying hold of the handle\nof his knife, he mentioned the name of Mac\nIntosh, in a manner which made US shuddcr\n\n\nat the danger oe this chief.

Two of the Generals Aids-de camps,\nand myself accepted the invitation, and we\nfollowed the Indians-Going along he show\ncd US an inclosure surrounded with palisades\nfilled with stays, mastiifs, and grey hounds,\nwhich they called their reserpe, and which\nsupplied them, when the chase proved un-\nfavorable. Hamley's cabin bordered upon\nthis enclosure We entered lt--There was\n\n\ngreat fire in the Fireplace, the day was\n\n\ndeclining, and the spacious habitation was\n\n\nlighted bv the flame of the fir tree. The\n\n\nfurniture was composed of table. two beds,\nsome large chairs, ozier baskets, fire arms,\n\n\nbows and arrows were hung upon the wall,\n\n\nand also violin. The arrangement OF all\n\n\nindicated the presence of a halt civilized man.\nI The companion of Hamly took down the VIII\n\n\nolin and managing the fiddle stick with more\n\n\nstrength than lightness, played some parts\n\n\nof an Indian air, which Immediately gave\n/ iIamly inclination to dance; but whether\n\n\nfrom courtesy, or from desire of making\n\n\ncomparison which was to his advantage, he\n\n\nbegged us to dance first, in the manner of\n\n\nour country. The grave Americans who\n\n\naccompanied me declined-younger or less\n\n\nreserved than they, did not wait to be ask\n\n\ned twice; and performed some OF our dull\n\n\nFrench dances. Hamlv asked no more,\n\n\nsaw him throw off what embarrassed him,\n\n\nseize great shawl and spring triumphantly\ninto the midst OF the room, as if he had said,\n\n\ns.Ths scene is for mel retired to leave\n\n\nthe field to him. His first movements, slow\n\n\nand with feeling, became animated by de-\n\n\ngrees; his dance incomparably more vio-\nlent and more expressive than our opera\n\n\ndances was soon only whirlwind which\nthe eve could not follow. In the intervals\n\n\nin which he stopped to take breath; his\n\n\nsteps became gradually slower; his head fell\n\n\ngently and followed gracefully the move\n\n\nments of his supple body, and his eyes\n\n\nwere brilliant with an emotion which height\n\n\nened the copper color of his complexion,-\n\n\nThe cries which escaped from him in rous-\ning up from this reverie to recommence his\nlively movements. had an unexpected effect\nupon us, which it is difficult to describe.\n\n\nTwo Indian women who | afterwards\n\n\nlearned were Hamly's wives, approached\n\n\nthe habitation, whilst it resounded with the\nsports of .mly and his applauses. but they\ndid not enter, alone perceived them\nThey had the beauty peculiar to their race;\ntheir vestment was composed OF long White\ntunic; of scarlet drapery thrown over their\nshoulders, their long hair leated at liberty\nthey carried upon their necks collar of\nfour or five rings of pearls, and in their ears\nenormous pendants of silver which are the\nnrinrinaI ornaments of Indian women.

One Of\nthe numbers contains an extract from Mr..\nlie Vassieur's Journal of Lafay tour\nmong the Greek Indians. It is written with\nSO much simplicity and spirit, that we can\nnot doubt the following translation will be\nhighly acceptable to our readers.\n\n\n\"Macon, pretty little town, which is now\ntolerably well peopled, was not in existence\neighteen months ago. 1t seems to have aris.\nEll from the forests as by enchantment. 1t\nis civil spot, lost amid the still immense\ndomains of thu first children Of America.\nAbout league thence we are in the bosom\nof virgin forests, and the tops of the trees\nwhich seem as old as the world hang over\nour heads. The winds sounded through\nthem by turns grave and shrill which M.\nde Ch4teaubriand calls the voice of the des-\nert Our road was a sort of trench, at the\nbottom of which the carriage of the Gener-\nal rolled with difficulty, and was often in\ndlnger of breaking. We followed on horse\nback and thus arrived at the Indian Agen-\ncy.\n\n\nThis is situated in the midst OF forests,\ncontructed for the convenience ot the Indian\n| Chiefs and the Agents of the United States,\nwho hold their conference there. 1t was\nthere that the treaty was formed, after\nWhich the Indian tribes still inhabitants of\nthe left branch of the Missouri, consented\nfor considerable sum, to retire to the right.\nThe wear 1897 was assigned for their evacu-\nalton. and it is not without pain that the In\ndians see this conclusion of their ancient\n/ Nbax, tutf \\, AZ\nthe neighborhooel of civilized men notwith-\nstanding they dislike them. They accuse\ntheir chiefs Of having betrayed them in max\ning this cession, and we are assured, that ii\nhas already cost the life of Macintosh, one\nof the slgners of the treaty.\n\n\nWe passed the night at the Indian Agen\nev--the habitatinn was deserted. For fifty\nwears the name of General Lafayette had\n| lived among them by tradition, and an hun\ndred Indians had waited to receive us; but\nthe delays which we experienced during oul\nrout having tired their patience, they had\ngone elsewhere to prepare reception. We\nhad 10 travel tfirty-two miles the next day\nby roote still less practicable--Such g\nstorm as we have never seen in England\n\n\nand which however do not wish to describe\nassaied us and dispersed us during some\n\n\nhours. Very happily we met with shelter\n\n\nit was cabin raised by an American, moi\n\n\nfar from our road. Some Indian hunters\n\n\nprobably in the habit Of taking shelter there\n\n\nwere driving their clothing around large\nfire. at which we took our place without be\ning known, and without attracting grea\ndeal Of attention. Mime, on the contrary\n\n\nWAS very strongly excited by this meeting\nthe first, had had Of the kind. had heari\n\n\nso much of these children OF nature, and hav\ning only lived in civilized country, hae\n\n\nformed such singular ideas about them tina\n\n\nthe least of their gestures, the smalles\npiece of their clothing or armour, excited II\n\n\nme almost as much astonishment, as the In\n\n\ndans in return seemed to feel upon seeins\n\n\nus.

We arrived at\nhabltation a little better than that of the\nwatch. 1t was group of cabins construct\ned with the bodies of ftrecs placed over each\nother and stripped of their bark-The host\nwas an American, who by reverse of for\ntune had been forced to take refuge in this\nplace, where he made a pretty lucrative\ncommerce, exchanging fur skins furnished\nby the Indians for commodities brought from\nthe civilized countries. His little farm was\ncomposed of some we'll cultivated acres, of\nwell furnished poultry yard, and the habi-\ntation have described. At our arrival we\nfound two Indians seated before the door,\none young, the other grown up man, and\nboth Of remarkable form and beauty. They\nwere clothed with short tunic of light and\ntringed stuff, fastened round their bodies by\ngirdle embroidered with small beads of\nthousand colors-A shawl oflively color was\nrolled round their heads with much ele-\ngance. Their trowsers of sheep skins reached\ndown to their knees. They rose at the ap-\nproach of the general, saluted him, and the\nYoungest, to our great astonishment, compl-\nmented him in very good English. We soon\nlearned that he had passed his youth in .\ncollege in the United Sta, es, but that he had\nstolen away many years ago from benefac-\ntor to return to his brothers, whose life he\npreferred to that of civilized men. The\nGeneral put many questions to him upon the\nexistence of the Indian colony. He replied\nTO them with much sense and precision\nWhen he was questioned as to the last trea-\nty concluded with the United States, his\n\n\ncountenance darkened, he struck his foot\n\n\non the grountl, and laying hold of the handle\nof his knife, he mentioned the name of Mac\nIntosh, in a manner which made US shuddcr\n\n\nat the danger oe this chief. As we appear\n\n\ned Observation-Disclosures cried he, \"has\n\n\nsold the land of his fathers-He has sacrifice\n\n\ned us all to his ayarice-It is impossible to\nbreak the treaty which he has formed; but\nthe scoundrel!\" He stopped after this vi\nolent exclamation, and little while after\ntook up quietly some other subject OF con-\nversation.\n\n\nHatnly Chat was the name of the young\nIndian) when he saw US little rested, en-\ngagged us to visit his habitation, which We\nperceived on the brow Of hill at a little dis\ntance. Two of the Generals Aids-de camps,\nand myself accepted the invitation, and we\nfollowed the Indians-Going along he show\ncd US an inclosure surrounded with palisades\nfilled with stays, mastiifs, and grey hounds,\nwhich they called their reserpe, and which\nsupplied them, when the chase proved un-\nfavorable. Hamley's cabin bordered upon\nthis enclosure We entered lt--There was\n\n\ngreat fire in the Fireplace, the day was\n\n\ndeclining, and the spacious habitation was\n\n\nlighted bv the flame of the fir tree. The\n\n\nfurniture was composed of table. two beds,\nsome large chairs, ozier baskets, fire arms,\n\n\nbows and arrows were hung upon the wall,\n\n\nand also violin. The arrangement OF all\n\n\nindicated the presence of a halt civilized man.\nI The companion of Hamly took down the VIII\n\n\nolin and managing the fiddle stick with more\n\n\nstrength than lightness, played some parts\n\n\nof an Indian air, which Immediately gave\n/ iIamly inclination to dance; but whether\n\n\nfrom courtesy, or from desire of making\n\n\ncomparison which was to his advantage, he\n\n\nbegged us to dance first, in the manner of\n\n\nour country. The grave Americans who\n\n\naccompanied me declined-younger or less\n\n\nreserved than they, did not wait to be ask\n\n\ned twice; and performed some OF our dull\n\n\nFrench dances.
