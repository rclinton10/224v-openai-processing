The chief Major Domo of the En-\npcror, who supplied her Majesty with what\nwas necessary for her cxpcnces, either to\nfiatter his master, or from some other mo.\ntive. intmated to him that the Empress ex-\npended a considerable deal Of money; as, fer\nthe last five or six months. the sums she had\nasked exceeded, already, seven thousand\ndollars.' The Etnperor desired to see the\naccount, and observed that the price Of the\ntwo horses was not included, FOR the pay\nment of which the Major Domo said he had\nnot funds. In consequence, Don Pedro pre-\nsented himself before her Majesty, with\nwhom he commenced disputing, calling her,\nto her face, an extravagant spcndthrift, &c.\n1t seems that the Empress answered, that\nwhen she was mere princess, she had\nmuch greater sum assigned for her purse\nthan that which was now allowed her. The\nconversation fell upon the horses, when the\nEmperor rcproached her with unnecessary\nexpense, where she had, already, horses\nsufficient. The Empress observed that they\nhad pleased her very much on account OF\ntheir singular beauty, and that it his maJes-\nty did not wish to pay for them. as he in\nsinuated. she would do SO. though it should\nbe by selling one of her jewels. The En-\nperor replied that he would dispose Of them.\nas he wished to present them to the little\nMarquesite daughter of the Marchiones ss\nof Santos. The Empress stung with indig-\nnation, (as she well might be, at the propos-\ncd mode of adjusting the matter,) made an\n! swcr that she would sooner have their\nthreats cut. than permit that SO 79orthtcss an\nIndividual should display her horses. The\nEmperor, then infuriated, struck her majes-\nty violent blow on her face, that knocked\nher to the foor and, while III that situation,\nkicked her several tines! Leaving her ex-\ntremely i'll in consequence of this usage, he\ncame to Rio Grande: and lastly, it is stated\nthat her majesty being examined after her\ndeath, the fetus which she had then in the\nwomb, was found with the head mutilated,\nand, already, even in state OF putrefac-\ntion!i\n\n\n.Surely this is a sum rather exiguous for per-\nsonage of such class-the more so in the case OF\nher maiesty, whose charity was SO notorious, and\nwho extended her benevoience to all the unhap-\npy who implored it.\n\n\nAs there is at this time an opinion existing\nin our Borough. rather unfavourable to the\nencouragement Of woollen protection, the\nfollowing compilation of opinions upon he\nsubject, from the National Journal may serve\nto throw some new light upon the subject :\n\n\nMr.. Davis, Of Massachusetts,. whose speech\non the woollens bill was considered by men\nof all parties as one of extraordinary strength\nand pertinence, who was of the Committee\nwhich prepared the bill, and who had made\nhimself perfectly acquainted with the ope'\nration of the law of 1924, says\n\n\n\"The law OF 1924 gave duty OF So Is\nper centum on imported fabrics; and it was\ndoubtless the design of the government that\nit should operate as clear protective duty;\nbut one half lit, or nearly that amount,\nhas been taken away by the Modification OF\nthe British Tariff, and the other halt is evad,\n\n\ned.

But here no such necessity exists\nWe are entitled by the purchase to all the\nwater that can flow through a certain ap\nerture. say los inches, and every person the\nleast acquainted with mechanics and the\npressure Of fluids, knows very we'll that it\nwill require at least three gallons on the\nwheel, in order to raise two gallons to an e.\nquail elevation. Why then incur an addi-\ntional expcnce to render the pump more\ncomplicated. for purpose worse than use\nless! Why not conduct the water from the\ngate directly at the pump and thereby re-\ntain an additional power equal at least to\none half of the quantity used by the citizens.",

            "article": "AyreS OF 24th March.\n\n\nIMPERIAL BARBARISM.\n\n\nA respectable literary gentleman, recent\nly arrived at Montcviteo, has communcat-\ned to friend in this place relation (Which\nhe had from the principal physician of the\ndeceased Empress OF Brazil) OF the event\nwhich occasioned the illness and death OF\nthat unfortunate lady.\n\n\nAccording to this account, tie Empress\nhad purchased two horses which had struck\nher with admiration BY their elegance and\nbeauty. The chief Major Domo of the En-\npcror, who supplied her Majesty with what\nwas necessary for her cxpcnces, either to\nfiatter his master, or from some other mo.\ntive. intmated to him that the Empress ex-\npended a considerable deal Of money; as, fer\nthe last five or six months. the sums she had\nasked exceeded, already, seven thousand\ndollars.' The Etnperor desired to see the\naccount, and observed that the price Of the\ntwo horses was not included, FOR the pay\nment of which the Major Domo said he had\nnot funds. In consequence, Don Pedro pre-\nsented himself before her Majesty, with\nwhom he commenced disputing, calling her,\nto her face, an extravagant spcndthrift, &c.\n1t seems that the Empress answered, that\nwhen she was mere princess, she had\nmuch greater sum assigned for her purse\nthan that which was now allowed her. The\nconversation fell upon the horses, when the\nEmperor rcproached her with unnecessary\nexpense, where she had, already, horses\nsufficient. The Empress observed that they\nhad pleased her very much on account OF\ntheir singular beauty, and that it his maJes-\nty did not wish to pay for them. as he in\nsinuated. she would do SO. though it should\nbe by selling one of her jewels. The En-\nperor replied that he would dispose Of them.\nas he wished to present them to the little\nMarquesite daughter of the Marchiones ss\nof Santos. The Empress stung with indig-\nnation, (as she well might be, at the propos-\ncd mode of adjusting the matter,) made an\n! swcr that she would sooner have their\nthreats cut. than permit that SO 79orthtcss an\nIndividual should display her horses. The\nEmperor, then infuriated, struck her majes-\nty violent blow on her face, that knocked\nher to the foor and, while III that situation,\nkicked her several tines! Leaving her ex-\ntremely i'll in consequence of this usage, he\ncame to Rio Grande: and lastly, it is stated\nthat her majesty being examined after her\ndeath, the fetus which she had then in the\nwomb, was found with the head mutilated,\nand, already, even in state OF putrefac-\ntion!i\n\n\n.Surely this is a sum rather exiguous for per-\nsonage of such class-the more so in the case OF\nher maiesty, whose charity was SO notorious, and\nwho extended her benevoience to all the unhap-\npy who implored it.\n\n\nAs there is at this time an opinion existing\nin our Borough. rather unfavourable to the\nencouragement Of woollen protection, the\nfollowing compilation of opinions upon he\nsubject, from the National Journal may serve\nto throw some new light upon the subject :\n\n\nMr.. Davis, Of Massachusetts,. whose speech\non the woollens bill was considered by men\nof all parties as one of extraordinary strength\nand pertinence, who was of the Committee\nwhich prepared the bill, and who had made\nhimself perfectly acquainted with the ope'\nration of the law of 1924, says\n\n\n\"The law OF 1924 gave duty OF So Is\nper centum on imported fabrics; and it was\ndoubtless the design of the government that\nit should operate as clear protective duty;\nbut one half lit, or nearly that amount,\nhas been taken away by the Modification OF\nthe British Tariff, and the other halt is evad,\n\n\ned. The memoralists, therefore, demand\nno more than what is reasonable, when they\nseek to obtain the full advantages in1ehoeo",
