The stage from Albany was overtur- ned in Westhampton, and the passengers and driver, ten in all, were thrown with violence among the rocks. Two were kil- led, two had a bone broken, four were sadly bruised, and two escaped unhurt. Mrs. Livingston, one of the wounded, with some difficulty reached the house of MT. Johas Brewer about twenty rods distant, & gave notice of the disaster. A son of MT. B. (Mr. B. was not at home, repaired im- mediately to the fatal spot, where one of the most horrid spectacles that can be ima- gined presented itself-two horses were ly- ing on the ground, the stage was dashed in pieces; among the fragments were two dy- ing men, or 4 persons severely wounded, and others less injured who had hardly re- covered from the shock. The young man, assisted by Mr. Spencer Bridgman who arrived soon after, placed those who were unable to walk, upon buffalo skin and up- on pieces of the stage, and drew them gen. tly to the house of Mir. Brewer. The peo- pie of the neighbourhood soon collected :; messengers were dispatched for surgeons j; and the wounded were distributed to seve- ral houses in the vicinity.",

But at Bosnia-Se- rail, the whole population threatned to burn whoever should read the irman and they wished to siege upon some Chris tian merchants under the pretexts that the measures of dissolving the Janisaries, and substituting regular disciplin'd regiments, had been suggested to the Sultan through their influence.

Some wag in, the village, 1 who understood the arrangement and who also knew the combination number of the ticket of mine host, on the evening the re- suit of the drawing was known here, pre- paired memorandum of the numbers, making the three first correspond with those Isof the tickets aforesaid, and had it convey l ed across the river that night to the fortu- 1 nate holder thereof He received this brief notice of Fortunes favor at rather a late hour, but notwithstanding, he could not forego the pleasure offingering the cust, which he verify supposed was in readiness for him. Without waiting to go through the formalities of the previous en- gagumcnt, he repaired forthwith to ferry boat which was chartered at price cor responding with the object of his mission and came immediately over with the vou- cher of his airy prize.

T'he Rip Rap Contract.-This formerly much\n\n talked of subject is revived again, and appears | likely to make considerable noise in the pot-\n\n ical world, and to occupy a porton of that short time that Congress can remain in ses- sion this year. The revival of this subject is in consequence of d letter published in the AL exandria Phoenix Gazette, and written by Mr.. F.. Mix to Major Satterlee Clark. That such of our readers as have not access to the Washington papers may learn the history of the present question, we shall publish the let ter alluded to, and as much other relative mat ter as our limits will admit.\n\n From the .4lsrundrm Cazette, Dec. 23.\n\n Most of our readers we presume have ei- ther heard or read of the celebrated ELIJAH MIx, whose name has hec1 so often associated with Castle Calhoun and the Rip Raps. This distinguished parsonage has again made his appearance in the political world much to the annoy ance, however, of those who contribu- ted, and were still endeavouring to contribute, to his fortune and consequence. He has kick ed up dust in Washington, from which the whole tribe of his late. associates are flying in every direction, denOuncing him with an in tenslty of bitterness, eqlalled only by that of their previous friendship. It appears that the War Department was yesterday about to close a contract for a further supply of stone neces- sary to the completion of the Notifications at Old Point Comfort, and that this same MT. Elijah Mix, had made the lowest proposals :; but just when he and some of his particular friendsin the Department thought that every thing was as snug as heart could wish, gen tleman oppOrtuneIy arrived from New-Y York and as the Roanoke Senator would say, blow ed them sky high sir :! sky high!!\n\n The gentleman alluded to is the author of several articles, signed Hancock, (which ap- peared in, the New-York papers,) serutinizing the official conduct of MT. Calhoun, while Secretary of War. To this gentleman Elijah Mix addressed letter, under date of the first of Nov. 1925, charging MT. Calhoun and Mir. Vandewenter, of the War Department, with a direct participation of the Rip Rap contract, and stating that he had the receipt of the lat ter gentleman for lO.5OO, portion of which was declared by him, to be for Calhoun's use. The letter was marked cOnidential;\" but Hancock not choosing to consider it SO, com municated it to the Secretary of War, who immediately rejected Mix's proposals, deem ing him unworthy to be party to a contract, and thinking, probably, that such man might have the hardihood, hereafter, to make an at tempt upon his reputation.\n\n We have procured a copy of the letter, which will be found below.

In spite of the apparent tranquility which reigns tn the capital, it is in a con- Stant state of fermentation.\n\n Odessa, NOr. T.-News from Constan. tinople to the 27ih of October, announces that this city is becoming anew the theatre of revolutionary movements. Although the Sultan employs his greatest means, that is to say, decapitatiOn, and re-establShes tranquility for the moment, it is certain he IS very far from obtaining the end he proposes.\n\n A Swiss Journal relates that Sir Fred erick Adams, during his stay at Geneva, said that the number of Greek women and children who took refuge in the places un- der his government was SO considerable that it would be out of his power to supply their most pressing wants unless grant was made for that purpose by the British Government.\n\n The Austrian Observer of Nov. 5th says: -'It was rumored at Corfu in the begin ming of October that the Egyptian fleet, having on board 5000 men of troops, had cast anchor in the southern part of the Peloponnesus, probably near Modon. This is the seventh expedition that Egypt has sent to the Morea.''\n\n RUssA.-A German Journal gives the following as list of the troops'which com- pose the Persian army that invaded the Russian territory :-Guards of the King and the Princes of the royal family, 4,0Oo men; Nomade troops 8O,OOO; militia, 15O,OOO cavalry, artillery, and infantry. trained a't EurOpeenne, 10000, of which 5000, form the Kings supplementary guard.\n\n On the 10th of Oct.

The Emperor has sent to the General sword of honor with the inscription-\"1'o the COnqueror of the Persians.\"\n\n A letter of Oct. 26th, from Warsaw, says -\"From the strength of the forces sent a. gainst Persia, it would seem that the pro- ject of Russia is to finish at d blow, and in the least time possible, campaign into which She has forced by the most unjust aggression. Nevertheless, it is to be fear ed that a single campaign will be insufi- cient, particularly as the season is so far advanced for great progress to be made du- ring the winter in the hospitable countries that form the theatre of war. Besides, the Russians will probably find more to strug- gle with in the difficulty of obtaining pro- visions, than in the strength of the enemy, especially as the inhabitants of the coun- try, rude and Mahometan for the most part, do not entertain very favorable disposi- tions towards their masters\"\n\n In the charge preferred against MT. Cal houn, by F. Mix, there is something extreme ly mortfying, and at the same time disgust ing, in the manner in which it is spoken of by the opposition. It is said by those editors the most strongly attached to the administration, that nobody believes the charge. We pre- sume that there is no person that really be- lieves that Mir. c. made an iniquitous contract with Mix, and as bonus for SO doing rcceiv- ed S19,500 from the latter but we presume there are many who do not believe that MT. c. or any other person is \"incapable of doing such an act.'''s Recent transactions in the ci- ty of New-York have proved incontestibly that great men can he villains. For ourselves we shall be perfectly satisfied with NC report of the committee to whom the business is re- ferred. In the mean time we would remark that the charge against Mir. q. is not more dis honorable to himself and disgraceful to the country, tLan the continual harping of the op- position presses of corruption and intrigue in the general administration. Indeed it is now pretended by these immaculate \" republicans that the charge was set on foot by e. MT. Clay, who intended that his hireling presses from Georgia to Maine should repeat the foul ca lumny, with none to contradict but the oppo- sition presses\" Now as disgraceful and foul as we believe conduct to be which should rem der such charge tangible, we believe it would not be more foul than acts such as are charged upon MT. Clay by the friends of MT. Calhoun. We do not believe either are guilty of base conduct in their official duties; but arc not vet prepared to extol the Vice President to the skies,\" as immaculate, and \" incapable\" of do- ing dishonest act, and condemn the Secre- S 0E H,An A< .H..-e N",

This affair ! led to another, of more consequence for 1 Niketas having discovered body of troops coming from Tripolizza, divined their in- temtion of passing the night at Mavrita, village some leagues distant, and'made pre- parations for attacking them. Accordingly, the Greeks arrived at the village about 3, X. M. and leaving their troop of cavalry, composed of l8O men, to cut off the ene- mics retreat, commenced an attack upon the houses. A body of 25O regular Arabi- an infantry sallied out, forced their way thro' the Greeks, and gained the plain but here they were met by the cavalry, and ] immediately threw themselves into hol- low square the cavalry (being led princi- paly by European officers, made gallant charge, broke their line, and sabred them almost to man. Meantime the other Greeks penetrated the village, drove out the Turks, and slaughtered about 80 of them. This affair, though it appears slight,\n\n \n\n it shows them that tho regular troops of the enemy are not invincible, and gives them more confidence in the plan of organizing regular cavalry.\n\n On the 1st August, Ibrahim Pacha left Tripol;zza with 5000 men, and directing his march Eastward, destroyed several v:l- lages, and laid waste the country as far as the sea-coast. He arrived at the opposite side of this gulfa few days ago, and the flames of Astros, which has been burning since yesterday morning, gives us notice of his movement. The inhabitants of the lat- ter village have fled to sort of Monastery, on the sea-coast, but were without amuni- ton when Niketas, who hovers round the enemy continually, threw himself into it, with few followers to defend it. A brisk firing last night ammo unced that the attack had commenced, but we know not the re- suit.\n\n Gen. Carrascakis left this place few days since, with body of Roumeliotes, tor Athens. The blessings of his Standard in the Church, was an effecting ceremony. It was interesting to see regenerated Greeks swearing to maintain the Banners of the Cross on the walls of the Parthenon, and to defend the city of Minerva against the host of modern barbarians.\n\n As for the internal politics and state of parties, it would be exceedingly difficult to give you clear idea of them.\n\n find upon examination of the parties and intrigue here, that almost all the events of importance have their origin in them. Does one man or one party undertake to assist his country, another party opposes him, and prefers that tho e.emy should gain an advantage, rather than his oppo- nent acquire the credit and influence to be derived from his defeat.\n\n But the limits of one sheet would be far from sufficient to detail the half of the past and present intrigues of parties in Greece. Foreign influence and intrigues do much, also, here. England works to counteract the influence of France and Russia. She would like to see Greece independent, but her relations will not allow her to accom- plish it herself, and her jealousy will not allow any other Power to do it. France would like to secure Greece, and her infu- : ence in Egypt at the same time.\n\n Iremain, sir, your obedient servant,\n\n s. G. HOWE.\n\n Aug. 18.-The Arabians, after ten vain ]! attempts to carry the position of Niketas, took up their march for Tripolizza this morning.",

Notwithstanding the boasted preparations of the enemy, the croakings of her ill-wishers, and the well-grounded fears of her real friends, she is in better condition, and more likely to finish the campaign advantageously, than she appea- red to be one month ago.\n\n The first division of the Turkish fleet came out of the Dardanelles about the 2Oth July, and directed it's course towards Sa- mos, intending to mako a landing but on the same day, Vice Admiral Sacturi, arri- wing to the assistance of that island, with thirty-five vessels, an engagement immedi- .ately, ensued, and was warmly continued for several hours, when the gallant Cana ris grapled a large frigate with his brulot. He applied the torch, aud, at the same mo- ment, the crew of the frigate rushed on board to prevent the confagration they separated the vessels after violent scufle but such was the rapidity of the flames, tha fifty of them perished, while the Greeks escaped in their boats, bearing away Can. aris, who was wounded. Two other brulots were prepared, but the Turkish fleet gave way before them, and were followed by the Greeks, who took all their shaloupes, des- . tined for the debarkation of the troops, and about four hundred and fifty prisoners Thus bafied, the enemy retired to Myti- lene. &\n\n In my last, I informed you of the fail. ure of Ibrahim P has attempted invasion of the district of Maina, of his loss there and his subsequent return to TriPolizza no remarkable events took place in tha quarter until July 26, when Gen. Niketas fsurnamed Turcophagos, or Turk Eater from the immense number of them he ha. kiIled) being upon the plain reconnoiterins with about twenty officers and men, wa suddenly cut of from the mountain, by ; body of the enemy's cavalry. His pres ence of mind saved him for, suddenly throwing himself into tue ruins of house he ordered his men not to fire until the enemy should be within half pistol shot. &S",

Hence the ap- prehensions of the monopoly, pass away. Hence, the certainty that competition at home will bring down prices, eventually, if not immediately, whilst it creates and diffuses new wealth at home labor being the foundation ofwealth, and producing and disseminating it more universally and in higher degrees, in proportion as it exists under diversified forms and in full activity. It is then that the farmer, the artizan and the merchant, give support to each other, each enlarging the occupation and the gain of each. The State, meanwhile, reaping the fruits in fiscal prosperity and political power. As regards the cotton manufacto- ries of the country, there are grounds for supposing that they now make a call for full one fourth part of all the raw cotton grown in the United States. It is gratify- ing to add, that those parts of the United States, where manufacturing establishments, of all kinds, flourish most, exhibit an anima- ted industry, an orderly aspect, and an in- creasing population. Towns and villages are seen rapidly to rise up in such districts, in restoring to which the rural population of the vicinity find ready and profitable sales for the various productions of farm ing, enterprise and labour. It is believed that, as these establishments shall rear themselves up, under adequate encourage ment, in augmented numbers and impor- tance, corresponding activity in trade will become their concomitant in the, same portions of country.\n\n The great scheme of national advance ment is to be seen in its true component parts in our Union-| arts naturally desti- ned to make up one systematic whole ,where the plough, the loom, and the ship, will each haveit appropriate sphere, in raising to proper elevation, the entire fabric of our social and public prosperity in car rying to the highest attainable pitch, our riches Jour happiness, our power.

The foundation of such a policy, once securely laid in that legislative assistance to our without which they must struggle in vain against those of other coun- tries. long and thoroughly established, an advantage not inherent, but adventitious, yet an overpowering advantage :; and as already proved in some articles of national importance, to which we have afforded eff ficent protection,we shall have nothing to fear for the future, Then, and only then, shall we be raised up to level, in this re- spect, with other countries.\n\n THE GKEEKS.\n\n Ertract cf O letter from Dr. Hoaoe to gentle\n\n anox 1n Woeb;oryon",

The story has been related to us as fellows.\n\n Mine host had purchased at the lottery of\n\n flee in this village, in the Virginia State or Dismal Swamp Canal Lottery It was agreed with neighbor of his, who had al- so purchased a ticket in the same lottery, that if the ticket of either sohuld chance to draw the highest prize, the one receiving the first information of the fact should ap- prize the other, whose house was then to be illuminated and splendid entertain ment given. Some wag in, the village, 1 who understood the arrangement and who also knew the combination number of the ticket of mine host, on the evening the re- suit of the drawing was known here, pre- paired memorandum of the numbers, making the three first correspond with those Isof the tickets aforesaid, and had it convey l ed across the river that night to the fortu- 1 nate holder thereof He received this brief notice of Fortunes favor at rather a late hour, but notwithstanding, he could not forego the pleasure offingering the cust, which he verify supposed was in readiness for him. Without waiting to go through the formalities of the previous en- gagumcnt, he repaired forthwith to ferry boat which was chartered at price cor responding with the object of his mission and came immediately over with the vou- cher of his airy prize. Finding it had be- come too late to count out 30 large sum that night, he determined by way of a. musement, to fulfil the latter clause of the contract with his neighbor, ,who,b by the bye, had been entirely forgotten, at thefrstpublic house he should meet, with such assistance as might come to hand.

T'he Rip Rap Contract.-This formerly much\n\n talked of subject is revived again, and appears | likely to make considerable noise in the pot-\n\n ical world, and to occupy a porton of that short time that Congress can remain in ses- sion this year. The revival of this subject is in consequence of d letter published in the AL exandria Phoenix Gazette, and written by Mr.. F.. Mix to Major Satterlee Clark. That such of our readers as have not access to the Washington papers may learn the history of the present question, we shall publish the let ter alluded to, and as much other relative mat ter as our limits will admit.\n\n From the .4lsrundrm Cazette, Dec. 23.\n\n Most of our readers we presume have ei- ther heard or read of the celebrated ELIJAH MIx, whose name has hec1 so often associated with Castle Calhoun and the Rip Raps. This distinguished parsonage has again made his appearance in the political world much to the annoy ance, however, of those who contribu- ted, and were still endeavouring to contribute, to his fortune and consequence. He has kick ed up dust in Washington, from which the whole tribe of his late. associates are flying in every direction, denOuncing him with an in tenslty of bitterness, eqlalled only by that of their previous friendship. It appears that the War Department was yesterday about to close a contract for a further supply of stone neces- sary to the completion of the Notifications at Old Point Comfort, and that this same MT. Elijah Mix, had made the lowest proposals :; but just when he and some of his particular friendsin the Department thought that every thing was as snug as heart could wish, gen tleman oppOrtuneIy arrived from New-Y York and as the Roanoke Senator would say, blow ed them sky high sir :! sky high!!\n\n The gentleman alluded to is the author of several articles, signed Hancock, (which ap- peared in, the New-York papers,) serutinizing the official conduct of MT. Calhoun, while Secretary of War. To this gentleman Elijah Mix addressed letter, under date of the first of Nov. 1925, charging MT. Calhoun and Mir. Vandewenter, of the War Department, with a direct participation of the Rip Rap contract, and stating that he had the receipt of the lat ter gentleman for lO.5OO, portion of which was declared by him, to be for Calhoun's use. The letter was marked cOnidential;\" but Hancock not choosing to consider it SO, com municated it to the Secretary of War, who immediately rejected Mix's proposals, deem ing him unworthy to be party to a contract, and thinking, probably, that such man might have the hardihood, hereafter, to make an at tempt upon his reputation.\n\n We have procured a copy of the letter, which will be found below.

Calhoun\n\n of any participation in the prcfts of contracts\n\n made by him but we are mot disposed to ! aConif him If nnr cnn xno A;,h,\n\n leve the charge in relation to MT.

In spite of the apparent tranquility which reigns tn the capital, it is in a con- Stant state of fermentation.\n\n Odessa, NOr. T.-News from Constan. tinople to the 27ih of October, announces that this city is becoming anew the theatre of revolutionary movements. Although the Sultan employs his greatest means, that is to say, decapitatiOn, and re-establShes tranquility for the moment, it is certain he IS very far from obtaining the end he proposes.\n\n A Swiss Journal relates that Sir Fred erick Adams, during his stay at Geneva, said that the number of Greek women and children who took refuge in the places un- der his government was SO considerable that it would be out of his power to supply their most pressing wants unless grant was made for that purpose by the British Government.\n\n The Austrian Observer of Nov. 5th says: -'It was rumored at Corfu in the begin ming of October that the Egyptian fleet, having on board 5000 men of troops, had cast anchor in the southern part of the Peloponnesus, probably near Modon. This is the seventh expedition that Egypt has sent to the Morea.''\n\n RUssA.-A German Journal gives the following as list of the troops'which com- pose the Persian army that invaded the Russian territory :-Guards of the King and the Princes of the royal family, 4,0Oo men; Nomade troops 8O,OOO; militia, 15O,OOO cavalry, artillery, and infantry. trained a't EurOpeenne, 10000, of which 5000, form the Kings supplementary guard.\n\n On the 10th of Oct. Te Deum was chaunted at St. Petersburgh, in thanksgiv- ing for the victory gained over the Persians, near Elisabcthpol by General Paskewitcll. The Emperor has sent to the General sword of honor with the inscription-\"1'o the COnqueror of the Persians.\"\n\n A letter of Oct. 26th, from Warsaw, says -\"From the strength of the forces sent a. gainst Persia, it would seem that the pro- ject of Russia is to finish at d blow, and in the least time possible, campaign into which She has forced by the most unjust aggression. Nevertheless, it is to be fear ed that a single campaign will be insufi- cient, particularly as the season is so far advanced for great progress to be made du- ring the winter in the hospitable countries that form the theatre of war. Besides, the Russians will probably find more to strug- gle with in the difficulty of obtaining pro- visions, than in the strength of the enemy, especially as the inhabitants of the coun- try, rude and Mahometan for the most part, do not entertain very favorable disposi- tions towards their masters\"\n\n In the charge preferred against MT. Cal houn, by F. Mix, there is something extreme ly mortfying, and at the same time disgust ing, in the manner in which it is spoken of by the opposition. It is said by those editors the most strongly attached to the administration, that nobody believes the charge. We pre- sume that there is no person that really be- lieves that Mir. c. made an iniquitous contract with Mix, and as bonus for SO doing rcceiv- ed S19,500 from the latter but we presume there are many who do not believe that MT. c. or any other person is \"incapable of doing such an act.'''s Recent transactions in the ci- ty of New-York have proved incontestibly that great men can he villains. For ourselves we shall be perfectly satisfied with NC report of the committee to whom the business is re- ferred. In the mean time we would remark that the charge against Mir. q. is not more dis honorable to himself and disgraceful to the country, tLan the continual harping of the op- position presses of corruption and intrigue in the general administration. Indeed it is now pretended by these immaculate \" republicans that the charge was set on foot by e. MT. Clay, who intended that his hireling presses from Georgia to Maine should repeat the foul ca lumny, with none to contradict but the oppo- sition presses\" Now as disgraceful and foul as we believe conduct to be which should rem der such charge tangible, we believe it would not be more foul than acts such as are charged upon MT. Clay by the friends of MT. Calhoun. We do not believe either are guilty of base conduct in their official duties; but arc not vet prepared to extol the Vice President to the skies,\" as immaculate, and \" incapable\" of do- ing dishonest act, and condemn the Secre- S 0E H,An A< .H..-e N",

This affair ! led to another, of more consequence for 1 Niketas having discovered body of troops coming from Tripolizza, divined their in- temtion of passing the night at Mavrita, village some leagues distant, and'made pre- parations for attacking them. Accordingly, the Greeks arrived at the village about 3, X. M. and leaving their troop of cavalry, composed of l8O men, to cut off the ene- mics retreat, commenced an attack upon the houses. A body of 25O regular Arabi- an infantry sallied out, forced their way thro' the Greeks, and gained the plain but here they were met by the cavalry, and ] immediately threw themselves into hol- low square the cavalry (being led princi- paly by European officers, made gallant charge, broke their line, and sabred them almost to man. Meantime the other Greeks penetrated the village, drove out the Turks, and slaughtered about 80 of them. This affair, though it appears slight,\n\n \n\n it shows them that tho regular troops of the enemy are not invincible, and gives them more confidence in the plan of organizing regular cavalry.\n\n On the 1st August, Ibrahim Pacha left Tripol;zza with 5000 men, and directing his march Eastward, destroyed several v:l- lages, and laid waste the country as far as the sea-coast. He arrived at the opposite side of this gulfa few days ago, and the flames of Astros, which has been burning since yesterday morning, gives us notice of his movement. The inhabitants of the lat- ter village have fled to sort of Monastery, on the sea-coast, but were without amuni- ton when Niketas, who hovers round the enemy continually, threw himself into it, with few followers to defend it. A brisk firing last night ammo unced that the attack had commenced, but we know not the re- suit.\n\n Gen. Carrascakis left this place few days since, with body of Roumeliotes, tor Athens. The blessings of his Standard in the Church, was an effecting ceremony. It was interesting to see regenerated Greeks swearing to maintain the Banners of the Cross on the walls of the Parthenon, and to defend the city of Minerva against the host of modern barbarians.\n\n As for the internal politics and state of parties, it would be exceedingly difficult to give you clear idea of them.\n\n find upon examination of the parties and intrigue here, that almost all the events of importance have their origin in them. Does one man or one party undertake to assist his country, another party opposes him, and prefers that tho e.emy should gain an advantage, rather than his oppo- nent acquire the credit and influence to be derived from his defeat.\n\n But the limits of one sheet would be far from sufficient to detail the half of the past and present intrigues of parties in Greece. Foreign influence and intrigues do much, also, here. England works to counteract the influence of France and Russia. She would like to see Greece independent, but her relations will not allow her to accom- plish it herself, and her jealousy will not allow any other Power to do it. France would like to secure Greece, and her infu- : ence in Egypt at the same time.\n\n Iremain, sir, your obedient servant,\n\n s. G.

Notwithstanding the boasted preparations of the enemy, the croakings of her ill-wishers, and the well-grounded fears of her real friends, she is in better condition, and more likely to finish the campaign advantageously, than she appea- red to be one month ago.\n\n The first division of the Turkish fleet came out of the Dardanelles about the 2Oth July, and directed it's course towards Sa- mos, intending to mako a landing but on the same day, Vice Admiral Sacturi, arri- wing to the assistance of that island, with thirty-five vessels, an engagement immedi- .ately, ensued, and was warmly continued for several hours, when the gallant Cana ris grapled a large frigate with his brulot. He applied the torch, aud, at the same mo- ment, the crew of the frigate rushed on board to prevent the confagration they separated the vessels after violent scufle but such was the rapidity of the flames, tha fifty of them perished, while the Greeks escaped in their boats, bearing away Can. aris, who was wounded. Two other brulots were prepared, but the Turkish fleet gave way before them, and were followed by the Greeks, who took all their shaloupes, des- . tined for the debarkation of the troops, and about four hundred and fifty prisoners Thus bafied, the enemy retired to Myti- lene. &\n\n In my last, I informed you of the fail. ure of Ibrahim P has attempted invasion of the district of Maina, of his loss there and his subsequent return to TriPolizza no remarkable events took place in tha quarter until July 26, when Gen.

The surest guide to our be- lief, under this head, is, that m those branches which have at length been ena- bled, through a provident legislation to stand up against the overwhelming com pefition of preestablishcd excellence and capital from abroad, which must otherwise have kept down forever their flrst attempts the article, can now be had cheaper m price, as well as better in quality, than the same article, from abroad, as 1t was seen in our market prior to the efficient protec- tion afforded to our own. Hence the ap- prehensions of the monopoly, pass away. Hence, the certainty that competition at home will bring down prices, eventually, if not immediately, whilst it creates and diffuses new wealth at home labor being the foundation ofwealth, and producing and disseminating it more universally and in higher degrees, in proportion as it exists under diversified forms and in full activity. It is then that the farmer, the artizan and the merchant, give support to each other, each enlarging the occupation and the gain of each. The State, meanwhile, reaping the fruits in fiscal prosperity and political power. As regards the cotton manufacto- ries of the country, there are grounds for supposing that they now make a call for full one fourth part of all the raw cotton grown in the United States. It is gratify- ing to add, that those parts of the United States, where manufacturing establishments, of all kinds, flourish most, exhibit an anima- ted industry, an orderly aspect, and an in- creasing population. Towns and villages are seen rapidly to rise up in such districts, in restoring to which the rural population of the vicinity find ready and profitable sales for the various productions of farm ing, enterprise and labour. It is believed that, as these establishments shall rear themselves up, under adequate encourage ment, in augmented numbers and impor- tance, corresponding activity in trade will become their concomitant in the, same portions of country.\n\n The great scheme of national advance ment is to be seen in its true component parts in our Union-| arts naturally desti- ned to make up one systematic whole ,where the plough, the loom, and the ship, will each haveit appropriate sphere, in raising to proper elevation, the entire fabric of our social and public prosperity in car rying to the highest attainable pitch, our riches Jour happiness, our power. A poli- cy short of this belongs not to free and in- telligent people, surrounded by the bounty of Providence, with varieties of climates and territory, fostering inclinations and aptitudes in human employments. The foundation of such a policy, once securely laid in that legislative assistance to our without which they must struggle in vain against those of other coun- tries. long and thoroughly established, an advantage not inherent, but adventitious, yet an overpowering advantage :; and as already proved in some articles of national importance, to which we have afforded eff ficent protection,we shall have nothing to fear for the future, Then, and only then, shall we be raised up to level, in this re- spect, with other countries.\n\n THE GKEEKS.\n\n Ertract cf O letter from Dr. Hoaoe to gentle\n\n anox 1n Woeb;oryon",

CALHOUN. To the Honorable the Members\n\n of the House of Representatives:\n\n An imperious sense of duty, and a sacred regard to the honor of the station which I occupy, compel me to approach your body in its high character of grand inquest of the nation.\n\n Charges have been made against me of the most serious nature, and which, if true, ought to degrade me from the high station in which have been placed by the choice of my fel- low citizens, and to consi gn my name to per- petuai infamy.\n\n In claiming investigation of the House, am sensible that, under our free and happy institution, the conduct of public servants is d fair subject of the closest scrutiny and the freest remarks and that firm and faithful discharge of duty affords, ordinarily, ample protection against political attacks, but when such attacks assume the character of inpeach- able offences, and become in some degree of ficial, by being placed among the public rec ordsyan officer thus assailed, however base the instruments used, if conscious of inno- cence, can look for refuge only to the Hall of the immediate Representatives ofthe peo- pie. It js thus find myself unexpectedly placed.\n\n On Wednesday morning last, it was for the first time mtimatcd to ule, that charges of a very serious nature against me were lodged m one of the executive departments dusing the day. rumOrs from several quarters, to the same effect, reached me but the first certain information oftheir character, was received yesterday morning through one of the news papers, of the District. It appears from its statements that am accused of the sordid and infamous crime of participation in the profits of contracts formed with the govern ment through the Department of War, while was entrusted with discharge of its du- ties, and that the accusation has been official ly presented as the basis of an official act of the War Department, and consequently, to be placed amOngits records as a lasting stigma on my character.\n\n Conscious of my entire innocence in this, and every other public aet, and that have ever been incapable in the performance of duty, of being influenced by any other mo- tive than a sacred regard to the public inter- est, and resolved, as far as human effort can extend, to leave an untarnishcd reputation to posterity, challenge the freest investigation ofthe House, as the only means effectually to repel this premeditated attack to prostrate me, by destroying forever my character.\n\n J.C.
