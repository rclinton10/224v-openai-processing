The walls are stone. % feet in height,\nOF suitable thickness, and laid in lime or well\npointed on each side. Round the barn, on\nthe inner side, are stables forming circle,\nthe manger within, and suitable places over\nil throw the hay or feed down; the stable\nand manger occupy about 10 feet, and are 8\nfeet high the stables open to and from sew\neral different yards, in order to make\nas many and such divisions Of their stock as\nthey have thought proper. The covering Of\nche stables form the barn floor, which also\nextends round the barn. There is but enc\nlarge door way for entrance with teams and\nloads; this is from the Northern side, from\nan offset or causeway, eight feet above the\nbase, and of course fourteen feet below the\ncaves. The cart or wagon that enters with\na load, makes the whole circuit of the floor,\nand after unloading comes out at the same\ndoor; thus or 10 teams can occupy the floor\nat one time in unloading, and not hinder each\nother. Within this circle of the stables and\nbarn floor is an area or bay, as it is usually\ncalled, which is filled with hay, &c, and\nmust be over sixty feet in diameter This\nis pitched in and on from any side or place\nmost convenient, or where wanted.\n\n\nThe roof comes to point at the centre,\nand sheds off the rain all around, something\nsimilar to an umbrella. 1t is supported from\nthe inner circle of the barn floor The ROOT\nboards are laid up and down, which by a\ntraverse saving Of the log we're all brough,\nto point, and then shingled round in the u\nsual mode.",

While the\nstiffness continues, the horse should be fed\nupon bran mashes. with small quantity OF\noats added, and be allowed but little water,\nand that not entirely cold. Exercise must\non no account be omitted.\n\n\nDeane's New England Farmer says \"lo\nfit horse for journey, he should not be sui\nfered to grow too fat and gross. lie should for\nsome time be kept in the stable rather than\nin the pasture. and fed mostly with proven\nder: but rather sparingly if he incline to be\nfat He should have exercise daily to hard\nen- his flesh, and keep him in the habit Of\ntravelling. He should be shod some days\nbefore he begins journey, that the shoes\nmay be well settled to his feet, and the nails\na little rusted at the points, that they hold\nthe faster And the pads of the saddle should\nbe we'll fitted to his back SO as to hill the\nholows, and bear equally on every part\nAnd while he is on a journey he should be\nstabbed every night. 1t is very destructive\n! to expose horses to the dampness and cold\nof the night after severe exercise. But It\nwould be best if neither horses nor any OF\nour cattle were wholly confined to dry meat\nin winter. Horses indicate this by their cat\ning snow with their hay Set basket OF\n! snow within reach of horse, when he is at\nhis manger, and he will take mouthful\n4 from each alternately. OF all juicy food for\nhorses in winter, writers seem to give car\nrots the preference. Potatoes and turnips\n! in small quantities are also recommended.\n1 They have been found by experience to an\nswer well instead of oats for laborng horses;\nand to fasten those which are lean. Carrots\nare said in the Domestic Encyclopedia to be\nparticularly seryiceable to broken wlnded\nhorses.\n\n\n\"Horses should not be too much deprived\nof the liberty of motion, they too often\nare. Close confinement after hard labour,\nwill be apt to abate their circnlations too\nsuddenly. make them chilly, and stlffcn their\njoints. Horses should therefore not be\nstraitened for room in their stables. Stables\nshould not be 50 low as to prevent their toss\ning up their heads as high as they please.\nSome stables have so little room over head\nas to bring horses into a habit OF carrying\n] their heads too low. They become afraid\nTO lift them up. They should also have room\nin their stables to turn their heads to any\npart of their bodies, that they may defend\nthemselves from the biting Of insects, alav\nitching, &C. And their halters should al,\nways be SO long, and their stables so wide\nthat they may lay conveniently Nor should\nhorses be so placed as to be able to deprive\neach other of fodder\n\n\n\"Horses that are daily worked in sum-\nmer, should be mostly kept on green fodder\nin stables, rather than grazed in pastures\nhe tendance Of them will not be 50 BURDEN\nsome, with spot Of high and thick grass\nat hand, as leading them to and from pas\ntnre at the distance of quarter Of mile.\nThis will prevent their being often chilled\nby feeding il wet nights.

The walls are stone. % feet in height,\nOF suitable thickness, and laid in lime or well\npointed on each side. Round the barn, on\nthe inner side, are stables forming circle,\nthe manger within, and suitable places over\nil throw the hay or feed down; the stable\nand manger occupy about 10 feet, and are 8\nfeet high the stables open to and from sew\neral different yards, in order to make\nas many and such divisions Of their stock as\nthey have thought proper. The covering Of\nche stables form the barn floor, which also\nextends round the barn. There is but enc\nlarge door way for entrance with teams and\nloads; this is from the Northern side, from\nan offset or causeway, eight feet above the\nbase, and of course fourteen feet below the\ncaves. The cart or wagon that enters with\na load, makes the whole circuit of the floor,\nand after unloading comes out at the same\ndoor; thus or 10 teams can occupy the floor\nat one time in unloading, and not hinder each\nother. Within this circle of the stables and\nbarn floor is an area or bay, as it is usually\ncalled, which is filled with hay, &c, and\nmust be over sixty feet in diameter This\nis pitched in and on from any side or place\nmost convenient, or where wanted.\n\n\nThe roof comes to point at the centre,\nand sheds off the rain all around, something\nsimilar to an umbrella. 1t is supported from\nthe inner circle of the barn floor The ROOT\nboards are laid up and down, which by a\ntraverse saving Of the log we're all brough,\nto point, and then shingled round in the u\nsual mode.",

While the\nstiffness continues, the horse should be fed\nupon bran mashes. with small quantity OF\noats added, and be allowed but little water,\nand that not entirely cold. Exercise must\non no account be omitted.\n\n\nDeane's New England Farmer says \"lo\nfit horse for journey, he should not be sui\nfered to grow too fat and gross. lie should for\nsome time be kept in the stable rather than\nin the pasture. and fed mostly with proven\nder: but rather sparingly if he incline to be\nfat He should have exercise daily to hard\nen- his flesh, and keep him in the habit Of\ntravelling. He should be shod some days\nbefore he begins journey, that the shoes\nmay be well settled to his feet, and the nails\na little rusted at the points, that they hold\nthe faster And the pads of the saddle should\nbe we'll fitted to his back SO as to hill the\nholows, and bear equally on every part\nAnd while he is on a journey he should be\nstabbed every night. 1t is very destructive\n! to expose horses to the dampness and cold\nof the night after severe exercise. But It\nwould be best if neither horses nor any OF\nour cattle were wholly confined to dry meat\nin winter. Horses indicate this by their cat\ning snow with their hay Set basket OF\n! snow within reach of horse, when he is at\nhis manger, and he will take mouthful\n4 from each alternately. OF all juicy food for\nhorses in winter, writers seem to give car\nrots the preference. Potatoes and turnips\n! in small quantities are also recommended.\n1 They have been found by experience to an\nswer well instead of oats for laborng horses;\nand to fasten those which are lean. Carrots\nare said in the Domestic Encyclopedia to be\nparticularly seryiceable to broken wlnded\nhorses.\n\n\n\"Horses should not be too much deprived\nof the liberty of motion, they too often\nare. Close confinement after hard labour,\nwill be apt to abate their circnlations too\nsuddenly. make them chilly, and stlffcn their\njoints. Horses should therefore not be\nstraitened for room in their stables. Stables\nshould not be 50 low as to prevent their toss\ning up their heads as high as they please.\nSome stables have so little room over head\nas to bring horses into a habit OF carrying\n] their heads too low. They become afraid\nTO lift them up. They should also have room\nin their stables to turn their heads to any\npart of their bodies, that they may defend\nthemselves from the biting Of insects, alav\nitching, &C. And their halters should al,\nways be SO long, and their stables so wide\nthat they may lay conveniently Nor should\nhorses be so placed as to be able to deprive\neach other of fodder\n\n\n\"Horses that are daily worked in sum-\nmer, should be mostly kept on green fodder\nin stables, rather than grazed in pastures\nhe tendance Of them will not be 50 BURDEN\nsome, with spot Of high and thick grass\nat hand, as leading them to and from pas\ntnre at the distance of quarter Of mile.\nThis will prevent their being often chilled\nby feeding il wet nights.
