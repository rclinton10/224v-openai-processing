Jack\nson is dsparagingy deficient. Jackson boasts of\n\n\nsingle victory gained at n ewOrleans but its spen.\n\n\ndor is diminished by the arbitrary acts of which he\nwas guilty during and after the achievement. Lis\nservices lawyer and statesman diminish TO al\nmost an atom. compared with the assidnous and al |\nmost nnumerablc and various engagements in which\nWashington employed his busy mind. Washing\ntoms free and complete submission to the authority\nOf the constitution his open ayowal of its sovereign.\nty and the sanctity of its spirit, all meet with ihe\nmost striking contradiction in the character and\n\n\nduct of Gen. jackson. The contracted circle Of\nJacksons same previous TO the battle Of New-Or-\n\n\nleans-his resignation Of all his civil Offices pre-\n\n\ndcated on his acknowledged inability to perform the\n\n\ndues,--the dormancy Of his talents at the most l-\n\n\nmuuous crisis, and his flight from the political con-\n\n\ntest, are facts which destroy all comparison, and\n\n\ndispaIage both the patriotism and the genius Of the\n\n\nGeneral. But why should his friends draw such an\n\n\ninappropriate parallel when the vote OF Jackson\n\n\nexpressed and recorded in lT0G denies the proprie\n\n\nity Of chusing Washington example. In con.\n\n\nsequence of the delivery of the valedctory address\n\n\nlot Gen. Washington, 81 resolution was adopted\n\n\nthat respectable address ought TO be presented to\nthe President in answer to his speech-and NlessTs\n\n\nAnes Baldwin, Madison, Sgrleves and Smith were\n, appointed a committee to draw up the address\n\n\nThis address conceded with the sentiments express\n\n\ned by Washington, lauded his services, and prayed\n\n\nthe benedictions Of heaven on the remainder OF his\n, days. Embodied in the address was the following\ng For our country's sake for the sake Of Republl-\n\n\ncan liberty, it is our earnest wish that your fTampe\nr mag be the guide ot yoar SUCCESSORS 6c F\" motion\n\n\nwas made Tor the expunging OF this, and supported\nj by remarks as disgraceul to the speaker they\n! were stigmatZing to the character of Washington.\n\n\nOn the vote favorable for expungng the above clause\n\n\nstands recorded, to his eternal disgrace, the vote Oi\n.
