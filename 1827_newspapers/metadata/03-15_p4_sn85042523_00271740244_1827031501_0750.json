English writers have\nrecommended the drill system for this arti-\nGle, but in our climate, have found this is\nentirely fallaciors. The proper mode is to\nhave your land properly prepared, to SOW\nthe seed broad cast, and to get it in during\nshe month of April, or in the early part of\nHAY. Fall sowing will not answer, for like\nclover. when sowed late, it is found not 70\nresist the winters frost. 1t may be sowed\nBY itself or with spring rye, barley, or oats;\nbut in the last case, / would recommend the\noats to be cut green, and before getting into\nseed by which means, an early feed for cat\ntie may be obtained, and the soil will not be\nso much (if auy) impoverished. But the\nmode l would most confidently recon-\nmend, would be to SOW with the luccrne\nabout half bushel Of common or winter\nrye. The effect of this is. that the rye\nwhich vegetables quickly serves as nurse tt\nthe young grass, against the heat OF the\nscorching sun; and by the time the gras\nattains strength to support ITSELF the ry,\nwithers and apparently dies. 1t will, how\never, come forth in the spring, and mixet\nfeed for cattle, and also add much to the\nQuantity of fodder. The rye will admit o\nbeing cut green this way, before getting\ninto seed, two or three times before II de.\nGays.\n\n\nThe quantity of seed would recommend\nTO be sowed to the acre would be from Is t\n90 ID. The kind of soil most suitable fol\nthis culture, is a dry mellow loan, but\nsandy or clay loan will also answer, provid\ned they are not wet In favorable season\nche lucerne may be kept the ensuing fall at\nter sowing. After the first season, you ma!\ngenerally begin to cut green for cattle b,\nthe first of May, which saves your youn!\npastures, and is in every respect great con\nvenience, as hogs, and every description o\nanimals. deyour it with equal avidity.\nproduces great quantity of seed, and i\nmuch more easily threshed out than clover\nThe second and third crops are the mos\nproductive of seed.

English writers have\nrecommended the drill system for this arti-\nGle, but in our climate, have found this is\nentirely fallaciors. The proper mode is to\nhave your land properly prepared, to SOW\nthe seed broad cast, and to get it in during\nshe month of April, or in the early part of\nHAY. Fall sowing will not answer, for like\nclover. when sowed late, it is found not 70\nresist the winters frost. 1t may be sowed\nBY itself or with spring rye, barley, or oats;\nbut in the last case, / would recommend the\noats to be cut green, and before getting into\nseed by which means, an early feed for cat\ntie may be obtained, and the soil will not be\nso much (if auy) impoverished. But the\nmode l would most confidently recon-\nmend, would be to SOW with the luccrne\nabout half bushel Of common or winter\nrye.

After the first season, you ma!\ngenerally begin to cut green for cattle b,\nthe first of May, which saves your youn!\npastures, and is in every respect great con\nvenience, as hogs, and every description o\nanimals. deyour it with equal avidity.\nproduces great quantity of seed, and i\nmuch more easily threshed out than clover\nThe second and third crops are the mos\nproductive of seed.

Billy, we have documents from Thomas\nHomes hand, which firmly prove that the\nnett profits on the first class after paying the\npriyes, amounted to 1896 dollars; and that the\nprofits on the second class amounted to 47oo dol\nlars. What an unfortunate business tor you'll\nYou say the third class was managed by Patrick\nfollowing will say to the contrary\n\n\nStatement of Patrick Higgins.\n\n\n81 shall state, as one Of the four managers OF\nthe Lottery, sold BY William; Larkin, principal\nmanager and treasurer, who received the pro-\ncceds of the four classes of the Delaware l4otte-\nry, intended by the Legislature OF this State lor\nthe use and benefit of st. Peters Church IN tins\nBorough, that after the first and second class\nes were drawn, VIM I.arkin requested me to\ntake the management of the Sd class, as he SAID\nhe was fatigued told him | would do any\nthing in nv power to assist the Church. lie\ngave me the tickets, and some tune after ne\ncame TO me, with Arthur Murphy, and SAID ne\nwould not sign the tickets unless Murphy and\nwould give him bill of indemnity, that IN case\nof loss in the third class, we should suffer like.\nAs poor Murphy and knew nothing more OF\nLottery schemes than an old woman, We signed\nthe bond now inform the public, that Will\nliam Iarkin, sometime after this. pursuaded poor\nMurphy to ioin with him and n. G. williamson,\nand form a Board Of Managers, and take the\nLottery from me; which they did, and Larkin\nand Tho's. Hope sold it between them. After\nthey took the third class from me, Larkin sent\nhis order to me to give Thomas Hope one thou\nsand tickets, which order hold to this day\nAlho' he states in the paper that it was under\nmy care the third class was sold l have Lar\nkin's order and Hopes receipt for every ticket\nhe got from me. This is the rich harvest tho't\nto save, which Larkin acknowledges to have dis\nappointed me in. He states the sd class was all\nunder my care, which is false, as | have his own\norder to prove il So This order and all the do\ncuments relative to the Lottery, gave to Doc\ntor Purcell by order of the Trustees; that, Lar\nkin, every statement you made in the Whining\ntonlan is false, and inform the public that [\nknow you these twenty five years, and that\nhave document relating TO you, to prove what\n| say TO be true.\n\n\nPAT'K HIGGINS.\n\n\nLarkin calls US selfcreated tmstees-you\nseem to forget the 18th of April 1924, when We\nwere the trustees, whom with the late and much\nto be regretted Victor Du Pont, rejected your\nrascally behaviour, and thrust you out of being\nTreasurer ora Trustee ever since, in the Church\nThe last day we met you was in Doctor PercclPs\nshop, where you began your old trade OF black\nguarlng us. You know you promised that\nday. which was the Esd Of January last, to bring\nup your books, and appointed the Doctor to set\ntie with the church on your part, and We ap\npointed the late and rcvered Victor Du Pont OF\nour part; which you agreed to: after, we saw\nMr., Du Pont he said if you would carry up youI\nbooks to Doctor Purcell to be examined, and il\nthe doctor could do any thing with the books re\nspectng settlement, Mr. Du Pont would call OF\nthe Doctor on Saturday after,to consult with him\nif they could arrange settlement. We return\ned to William Larkin and informed him of what\nMr.. Du Pont said to us-4.arkln's answer to u!\nwas, he had no books, and would settle no &C\ncounts. See this unprincipled man--equaly re\ngarlless Of his solemn promise, or of committing\nsacrlcge. His actions arc the surcst standard\nto Judge him by. After the Lottery was drawr\nin January, 1924, we, the trustees of st. Peter.\nChurch, insisted on settlement from Larkin.-\nWhat does this monster of inquity do TO ami\nhilate the church and trustees, SO that, as he\nsupposed there would be none to demand the\nproceeds ofthe Lottery of him-lIe causes vii\nliam Boyd sue the Church for the amount Of hi'\nbill, which was about $1,000, with an expectation\nof Mr.. Boyd's getting Judgment and execution\nand then selling the house. He did not wish Il\nbe bothered for Lottery money--he had q bette\nuse loi IL til'''i SNhS ~ \" ~ S'S Va ot' 'u'\nBY his Withholding from the Church the proceeds\nOf the Lottery, he withholds from the widow anl\nthe orphan, and prevents numbers poor chill\ndren of An early education, to make them usetu\nmembers of society\n\n\n| Larkin falsely charges DIR, Purcell with sowing\ndiscord in the congrcgation-this we, the trus\ntees Of st. Peters Church affirm to be false\nhood We offered DR.. Purcell to take charge\nof our funds, which he refused and We are Ger\ntain nothing gives you more trouble than youl\nnot getting hold Of them, The balance of pew\nrent and subscriptions to the church, which re\nmanned in your hands at the time you were re\nmoved from the office of Treasurer, you hold al\nthis time. You keep all our former books ant\nchurch accounts, and thereby the church sus\ntains great loss.\n\n\nThe pencil Of an Angelo or Raphael-the\ntongue of Cicero, Rurk, Gratan, or Curran\nwould not be adequate to describe the peit'ly o.\nthat man.
