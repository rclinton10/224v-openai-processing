Being afraid that the pig, in the sty might be stolen, they transferred him to the cellar. After some time, piggy contrived to ascend into the kitchen, and inspect the cupboard in that he found about pounds of bacon, which he, in most cannibal-like manner, devoured. His repast soon sed sought for something to allay his thirst, and, in the course of his researches, he smelt savory in the upper regions. Accordingly he scrambled up stairs into a bedroom. There he found wherewith to wash down thf bacon, for on the floor he found sever- al bottles of elderberry wine. ''Drawing of corks\" he did not understand but in 'cracking a bottle, /\" he proved himself to be as dexterous as any bon OiUent in the parish. Bul his freaks nov drew to a close; poor piggy got as ''drunk as Dayid's sow;\" he capered about, threw down the chairs, upset certain utensil, broke the wash-hand basin, and swallowed the soap. The last performance proved the cause of great a. arm to the neighborhood for in the gaity of his heart, he got up on his hind legs, aud, with his snout all over soap suds, and his masters night-cap on his head, looked out of the window, for the benifit of the air.-Being observed, gteat outcry was raised and it was quickly rumored that there was a mad pig, foamimg ot the mouth, looking out of a chamber window in Carey street: and the tipsy poker,by all accounts, certainly had very queer look. It was proposed to shoot him to prevent further mischief; but after much pro and con, a resolute man went up, and by a little skill ful manGuvering, poped poor piggy into a poke, brought him safely down, and he was deposited in his sly, without other damage to himself than being a little the scorse for Nquos. s\n\n Wonderful.-There was exhibit ed, few weeks ago, in boat at the market sreet landing place, ,Steubeny.lle, ilae bones of a non-descript animal, one of which is 20 feet in length, 8 in width, and weighs upwards Of twelve hundred pounds. The back bone is l6 inches in diameter, and lated from the size of the bones that the animal, when living, must have been about fifty feet in length, 20 to 26 feet in width, and about 20 in heighth and that it must have weighed at least 20 tons. These bones were found near the Mississippi river, ill i've believe) Louisiana and form tlIe greatest natural curiosity that we ever be- held.

Statesman, says that, |''oweing.to the religious zeak of the Ouch ess D'Angouleme, and disposition of the government to increase the influence of the Church with hope of rendering it subservient to State purposes, France is at present almost as pries-ridden as it was before the Revolution. Monas;ic in- stitutions are encouraged. Ecclesiastical fraternities are multiplied, and the ear is stunned with the ringing of bells during all hours of the day and night. Swarms of ignorant, lazy, and frequently vicious priests are quartered upon the people; the yeriest drones of society, serving no other purpose than paid the cause of legit;ma- cy. The number both of soldiers and ecclesiastics Is much greater in the south of Paris, since the sentiments and afec- tions ofits inhabitants are supposed to be less loyal and not so fully under tho eye of the government ...,\n\n A letter from Capt.

Being afraid that the pig, in the sty might be stolen, they transferred him to the cellar. After some time, piggy contrived to ascend into the kitchen, and inspect the cupboard in that he found about pounds of bacon, which he, in most cannibal-like manner, devoured. His repast soon sed sought for something to allay his thirst, and, in the course of his researches, he smelt savory in the upper regions. Accordingly he scrambled up stairs into a bedroom. There he found wherewith to wash down thf bacon, for on the floor he found sever- al bottles of elderberry wine. ''Drawing of corks\" he did not understand but in 'cracking a bottle, /\" he proved himself to be as dexterous as any bon OiUent in the parish. Bul his freaks nov drew to a close; poor piggy got as ''drunk as Dayid's sow;\" he capered about, threw down the chairs, upset certain utensil, broke the wash-hand basin, and swallowed the soap. The last performance proved the cause of great a. arm to the neighborhood for in the gaity of his heart, he got up on his hind legs, aud, with his snout all over soap suds, and his masters night-cap on his head, looked out of the window, for the benifit of the air.-Being observed, gteat outcry was raised and it was quickly rumored that there was a mad pig, foamimg ot the mouth, looking out of a chamber window in Carey street: and the tipsy poker,by all accounts, certainly had very queer look. It was proposed to shoot him to prevent further mischief; but after much pro and con, a resolute man went up, and by a little skill ful manGuvering, poped poor piggy into a poke, brought him safely down, and he was deposited in his sly, without other damage to himself than being a little the scorse for Nquos. s\n\n Wonderful.-There was exhibit ed, few weeks ago, in boat at the market sreet landing place, ,Steubeny.lle, ilae bones of a non-descript animal, one of which is 20 feet in length, 8 in width, and weighs upwards Of twelve hundred pounds. The back bone is l6 inches in diameter, and lated from the size of the bones that the animal, when living, must have been about fifty feet in length, 20 to 26 feet in width, and about 20 in heighth and that it must have weighed at least 20 tons. These bones were found near the Mississippi river, ill i've believe) Louisiana and form tlIe greatest natural curiosity that we ever be- held.

Statesman, says that, |''oweing.to the religious zeak of the Ouch ess D'Angouleme, and disposition of the government to increase the influence of the Church with hope of rendering it subservient to State purposes, France is at present almost as pries-ridden as it was before the Revolution. Monas;ic in- stitutions are encouraged. Ecclesiastical fraternities are multiplied, and the ear is stunned with the ringing of bells during all hours of the day and night. Swarms of ignorant, lazy, and frequently vicious priests are quartered upon the people; the yeriest drones of society, serving no other purpose than paid the cause of legit;ma- cy. The number both of soldiers and ecclesiastics Is much greater in the south of Paris, since the sentiments and afec- tions ofits inhabitants are supposed to be less loyal and not so fully under tho eye of the government ...,\n\n A letter from Capt.
