This picture had\nsurface Of feet by g exactly the fourth\npart of the size of those now iii the Capitol;\nand the artist was offered for it at the time.\nand refused, 1900 guineas, equal to S5592.\nThe small preparatory study, 20 inches BY\nso, was afterwards purchased by Sir Fran.\nels Barring, who paid for it 500 guineas, e.\nDUAL to $3.50 dollars, and is now in the pos\nsession of his son Alexander Barring, Esq i'll\nLondon.\n\n\nThis work established the reputation of\nthe artist in Europe, and he might have pur-\nsued his profession in London or Paris, with\nthe farest prospect Of success; but the mo-\nment for which he had waited was arrived\nthe present constitution of the United States\nwas adopted.-Washingto was President,\nand many of the early patriots and heroes OF\nthe revolution were re-assembled in the va\nrious departments of the new government;\nthe country wasin prosperity, and every Cir\ncumstance concurred to favor his original\nplan.\n\n\nWe find him therefore returning to Amer\nica in November, 1885, passing the win\nter in New York, which was then the seat\nof government, and there procuring many\nportraits of distinguished men, civil and mill\ntary, to be introduced in the course of his\ngreat work.\n\n\nThus far he had proceeded in his object.\nwithout patronage, public CT private, with\ndevotion, which, in the estimation Of many\nof his friends, bordered on insane enthusiasm.\nIn April, 1890, he published, in New York,\nq prospectus of his intended work, and\nsolicited subscriptions for the prints of Bun\nkers Hill and Quebec, which were alrea.\nDIV in progress in the hands Of eminent en-\ngravers.\n\n\nThe work now received substantial pat\nronagc--and in the course ot three years the\nnames of subscribers amounted 10 nearly\n500; !. sum, however, not quite sufficient 70\ncover the expense Of engraving the two\nplates, each was contracted for at the price\nof one thousand guineas, equal to 1866 dol\nlars.\n\n\nCol Trumbull remained in America until\nNav, 1894, during which time he travelled\nfrom. New Hampshire to South Carolina,\nevery where endeavouring to obtain pnr-\ntraits of the distinguished men who had\nbeen actors in those subjects which he had\nselected, as well as views OF the place.\nwhich had been the scenes of the several\nactions; and had, in great measure, COM\npleted his collection of materials for the en-\ntire work.\n\n\nDuring this period, the French revolution\ncommenced with promise OF results which,\nwere most lamentably defeated; and ms\ning in its course to a moral and political\ntornado, threatened to sweep before it all\nestablished institutions, and to reduce hui\nman society to its original elements. The\narts Of peace disappeared before the spi-\nTit OF war Europe became an immense\ncamp; and America hardly escaped being\ninvolved in the universal desolaton of the\ntempest.\n\n\nIn MAY. 1894, Mr. Jay was appointed Min\nister Penpotentarv to Great Britain; and\nwe find Col. Trumhul accompanying him in\nthe character Of Secretary.\n\n\nIn 1896 he received from President Wash\nington a commission TO reside in London, as\nagent for the recovery of impressed seamen,\nwhich he declined, in consequence of having\nDeen appointed, in the manner provided by\nthe treaty, the fifth of that board of COM\nmissioners who were authorized TO carry in\nto effect the 9TH article of the treaty, which\nrespected irregular OF illegal captures, one\nof the most important objects of the negotia-\ntion of Mr.. Jay.\n\n\nThis commission brought their arduous\nlabours to an honourable conclusion in the\nspring OF 1904, when the artist returned to\nthe United States to witness new and un-\nsuspicious state ofpublc affairs. The demon\nof party discord had sunk the character of\nAmericans in the patry distinctions of Brit\nisb or French partizans, and it would have\nbeen idle at such time and in such an alb\nsence OF all national feeling to persevere in\nhis work of the Revolution. The project,\ntherefore, slept, until. in happier moment,\nthat joint resolution Of the two Houses of\nCongress was passed, which authorised the\npainting of those four subjects, which are\nnow placed in what may, with proprety,\nbe called, in future, the Hal cftAe Revolu-\ntion.\n\n\nIn those four paintings, this nation possess\nes which no other nation Of people have yet\npossessed. Il is our peculiar fate to have\nsprung into existence under circum stances\nas singular in their nature, as the result has\nbeen glorious Our infant years are not only\ndistinguished by the rugged virtues of war\nbut by the polished elegancies Of the arts of\npeace; ard through the perseverance Of orc\nman, which we believe has no parallel, dis\ntant posterity will be able to view the { f.ith\nfull representations of those to whose hardi-\nhood they stand indebted for their proud in\nheritance.\n\n\nWe are happy to learn from the proceed\nings of the House of Repre- sentatiges, that\nthere is an intention to fill the remaining\nvacant spaces in the grand Hail with other",

This picture had\nsurface Of feet by g exactly the fourth\npart of the size of those now iii the Capitol;\nand the artist was offered for it at the time.\nand refused, 1900 guineas, equal to S5592.\nThe small preparatory study, 20 inches BY\nso, was afterwards purchased by Sir Fran.\nels Barring, who paid for it 500 guineas, e.\nDUAL to $3.50 dollars, and is now in the pos\nsession of his son Alexander Barring, Esq i'll\nLondon.\n\n\nThis work established the reputation of\nthe artist in Europe, and he might have pur-\nsued his profession in London or Paris, with\nthe farest prospect Of success; but the mo-\nment for which he had waited was arrived\nthe present constitution of the United States\nwas adopted.-Washingto was President,\nand many of the early patriots and heroes OF\nthe revolution were re-assembled in the va\nrious departments of the new government;\nthe country wasin prosperity, and every Cir\ncumstance concurred to favor his original\nplan.\n\n\nWe find him therefore returning to Amer\nica in November, 1885, passing the win\nter in New York, which was then the seat\nof government, and there procuring many\nportraits of distinguished men, civil and mill\ntary, to be introduced in the course of his\ngreat work.\n\n\nThus far he had proceeded in his object.\nwithout patronage, public CT private, with\ndevotion, which, in the estimation Of many\nof his friends, bordered on insane enthusiasm.\nIn April, 1890, he published, in New York,\nq prospectus of his intended work, and\nsolicited subscriptions for the prints of Bun\nkers Hill and Quebec, which were alrea.\nDIV in progress in the hands Of eminent en-\ngravers.\n\n\nThe work now received substantial pat\nronagc--and in the course ot three years the\nnames of subscribers amounted 10 nearly\n500; !. sum, however, not quite sufficient 70\ncover the expense Of engraving the two\nplates, each was contracted for at the price\nof one thousand guineas, equal to 1866 dol\nlars.\n\n\nCol Trumbull remained in America until\nNav, 1894, during which time he travelled\nfrom. New Hampshire to South Carolina,\nevery where endeavouring to obtain pnr-\ntraits of the distinguished men who had\nbeen actors in those subjects which he had\nselected, as well as views OF the place.\nwhich had been the scenes of the several\nactions; and had, in great measure, COM\npleted his collection of materials for the en-\ntire work.\n\n\nDuring this period, the French revolution\ncommenced with promise OF results which,\nwere most lamentably defeated; and ms\ning in its course to a moral and political\ntornado, threatened to sweep before it all\nestablished institutions, and to reduce hui\nman society to its original elements. The\narts Of peace disappeared before the spi-\nTit OF war Europe became an immense\ncamp; and America hardly escaped being\ninvolved in the universal desolaton of the\ntempest.\n\n\nIn MAY. 1894, Mr. Jay was appointed Min\nister Penpotentarv to Great Britain; and\nwe find Col. Trumhul accompanying him in\nthe character Of Secretary.\n\n\nIn 1896 he received from President Wash\nington a commission TO reside in London, as\nagent for the recovery of impressed seamen,\nwhich he declined, in consequence of having\nDeen appointed, in the manner provided by\nthe treaty, the fifth of that board of COM\nmissioners who were authorized TO carry in\nto effect the 9TH article of the treaty, which\nrespected irregular OF illegal captures, one\nof the most important objects of the negotia-\ntion of Mr.. Jay.\n\n\nThis commission brought their arduous\nlabours to an honourable conclusion in the\nspring OF 1904, when the artist returned to\nthe United States to witness new and un-\nsuspicious state ofpublc affairs. The demon\nof party discord had sunk the character of\nAmericans in the patry distinctions of Brit\nisb or French partizans, and it would have\nbeen idle at such time and in such an alb\nsence OF all national feeling to persevere in\nhis work of the Revolution. The project,\ntherefore, slept, until. in happier moment,\nthat joint resolution Of the two Houses of\nCongress was passed, which authorised the\npainting of those four subjects, which are\nnow placed in what may, with proprety,\nbe called, in future, the Hal cftAe Revolu-\ntion.\n\n\nIn those four paintings, this nation possess\nes which no other nation Of people have yet\npossessed. Il is our peculiar fate to have\nsprung into existence under circum stances\nas singular in their nature, as the result has\nbeen glorious Our infant years are not only\ndistinguished by the rugged virtues of war\nbut by the polished elegancies Of the arts of\npeace; ard through the perseverance Of orc\nman, which we believe has no parallel, dis\ntant posterity will be able to view the { f.ith\nfull representations of those to whose hardi-\nhood they stand indebted for their proud in\nheritance.\n\n\nWe are happy to learn from the proceed\nings of the House of Repre- sentatiges, that\nthere is an intention to fill the remaining\nvacant spaces in the grand Hail with other",

One writer\nsays, \"0ur ministes are strongly attached to\ntheir places, and they know that they would be\nhurled from them in twenty four hours if they\nwere to take that step\" Another says, that\nFrance and England understand each other per.\nfectly well, and will avoid rupture Letters\nfrom Lisbon Of the 9th received at iiavre, men\ntoned that the Portuguese insurgents had been\nbeaten by the militia of the Country.\n\n\nThere is nothing later from England The\nnews Of the sending of troops to Portugal, with\nMr.. Cannng's speech, &c. has just reached Paris\nand the public were awaiting with great solci-\ntutle, to see what course the French government\nwould adopt. 1t appears that the concluding\npassage in the address Of Charles 10th, in which\nhe ref,rs to the French arms, had caused great\nfall in the funds in Paris and the first report of\nthe measures in England, produced panic; but\nthe declaration IN the speech of the King of\nEngland, of the favorable disposition of the pow\ncrs to the preservation Of peace, had caused a\nrise. 1t is now reported that the concluding\npassage WAS inserted in the French Kings\nspeech, in consequence Of the keeper of the\nseals having suddenly deserted NJ. Vele and\ntaken sides against the pacific party. A private\nletter from Raronne, states, that the troops\nwere to be Withdrawn from Spain, to avoid coun-\ntenancing the invasion OF Portugal but there ap-\npears to be nothing certain in these various rll-\nmo'irs.\n\n\nThe party il France called the Congre cation,\narc considered rs going hand in hand with the\nultra party in Spain, being incline,lto war with\nEngland, and having hopes Of exciting diver\nsion in ireland.\n\n\nThe Chamber Of Deputies was to be opened\non the 18th Dec. but after several calls, the re.\nqGsltc number for session not being present,\nit did not take place.\n\n\nGREEC E.-A letter dated Napoli, Oct. 18th\nsays:--An English vessel which arrived ycstcr.\nday ron Constantiuoplc, brought to the Com\nmittce ofthc National Assembly, (thc Committee\nOf Ihirtecn,) letter from Mr. S.

He had had several conferences with\nthe minister at war, and it was determined that\nthe army should be put on the same footing as\nit was twelve years ago.\n\n\nThe following view of the Royal Family\nt'''N'\nwithout interest for the American reader.\n\n\nFrom the advanced age Of the present\nRoyal Family there is every probability of\nan early Regency, which will be of consd\ncradle duration--The health of the Kinr.\nthough at present good. is at best precari-\nGus. lie is now sixty-four years OF age, or\nthree score wears and four; and of that habit\nOF body which seldom reaches the scrptural\nperiod OF \"three score years and ten\" The\nhlng IS not quite one year older than the\nDuke OF York, whose constitution, though\nacted upon by more temperate habits an\npears to be breaking up, as Doctors sav.-I\nihe Duke of Clarence is two wears Younger\nthan the Duke of York fwithin five DAYS\nand therefore less than three years younprr\nthan the King.\n\n\nII is remark able that the three first some\nOF the late King were all born in August.\nthe Duke ct Clarence being within four days\nOF inc king, and being within five tays Of\nntDuke OF York.
