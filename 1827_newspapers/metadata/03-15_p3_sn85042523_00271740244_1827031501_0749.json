Almeida\nhad, sometime previous to the 25th, fallen\ninto their hands. in consequence of the\ntreachery of the garrison. About the time\nthat the English troops landed i'll Portugal,\nthe affairs of the rebels seem to have begun\nto decline. On the 23d of December they\nseem to have not only been in undsturbed |\npossession of the whole of Traz os-Montez,\nbut of great part of the adjoining province\nof Beira. A line drawn from Chaves, on\nthe northern frontier, to Vizeu, and thence |\nto the Spanish frontier, will describe the\nlimits of the rebels power, which extended\nover nearly a.ffM fart of the surface of Por-\ntugal. But about this time the troops OF\nGen. Claudino advanced towards Vizeu, to\nJoin the Constitutional forces under Azcrede;\n\n\n\n\n\nhad cleared the frontier south OF the Estrel-\n| la, of the struggling parties which had en-\ntered from Spain, marched upon Guarda,\nout Of which he drove the rebels. On the\nnext day he marched forward, also in the\ndirection of Nizeu. by Celorie. so that the\nrebels in Nizcu were threatened; by three\ncorps. According to the last intelligence,\nthey had left that town. fearing to be attack\ned, and had commenced their retreat.\n\n\nsit is satisfactory that affairs had taken\nthis turn before the arrival OF the British\ntroops, as it shows that the disaffection to\nthe Constitution is far from being general\n/ Though there had been much treachery and\ndcsertions among the army, the Constitu-\ntionalists have notiwanted faithful troops and\nactive leaders. From the notices which\nreach us, the conduct of the Count de Villa\nFlor (believe young oficer) appears 70\nhave been marked with great energy and\nJudgment. After having thrown back the\nrebels, who had attacked Villa Vicosa and\n\n\nEstremos, into Spain, and completely secur-\n\n\ned the country south Of Tagus, he crossed\nthat river, advanced rapidly along the from\n\n\ntier to the north, passed the chain OF the Es-\ntrella, which he also cleared OF some parties,\n\n\ndrove the rebels out of Guarda, and imme-\ndiately moving on Celorico, threatened the\n\n\nrear of the Marquis of Chaves, and probably\n\n\ndetermined his retreat. Under the clrcum-\n\n\nstances of the season, the nature OF the cnun-\ntry, and the warfare which he has had to\ncontend, the movements seem to have been\nJ made with AS much rapdity as success.\n! \"The province of Mimic has continued Sc\n! cure-few triAing attacks made on the north\n,, part of the line of the remega having beer\n\n\nrepulsed with loss\"\n\n\n\"London, Jan.

Almeida\nhad, sometime previous to the 25th, fallen\ninto their hands. in consequence of the\ntreachery of the garrison. About the time\nthat the English troops landed i'll Portugal,\nthe affairs of the rebels seem to have begun\nto decline. On the 23d of December they\nseem to have not only been in undsturbed |\npossession of the whole of Traz os-Montez,\nbut of great part of the adjoining province\nof Beira. A line drawn from Chaves, on\nthe northern frontier, to Vizeu, and thence |\nto the Spanish frontier, will describe the\nlimits of the rebels power, which extended\nover nearly a.ffM fart of the surface of Por-\ntugal. But about this time the troops OF\nGen. Claudino advanced towards Vizeu, to\nJoin the Constitutional forces under Azcrede;\n\n\n\n\n\nhad cleared the frontier south OF the Estrel-\n| la, of the struggling parties which had en-\ntered from Spain, marched upon Guarda,\nout Of which he drove the rebels. On the\nnext day he marched forward, also in the\ndirection of Nizeu. by Celorie. so that the\nrebels in Nizcu were threatened; by three\ncorps. According to the last intelligence,\nthey had left that town. fearing to be attack\ned, and had commenced their retreat.\n\n\nsit is satisfactory that affairs had taken\nthis turn before the arrival OF the British\ntroops, as it shows that the disaffection to\nthe Constitution is far from being general\n/ Though there had been much treachery and\ndcsertions among the army, the Constitu-\ntionalists have notiwanted faithful troops and\nactive leaders. From the notices which\nreach us, the conduct of the Count de Villa\nFlor (believe young oficer) appears 70\nhave been marked with great energy and\nJudgment. After having thrown back the\nrebels, who had attacked Villa Vicosa and\n\n\nEstremos, into Spain, and completely secur-\n\n\ned the country south Of Tagus, he crossed\nthat river, advanced rapidly along the from\n\n\ntier to the north, passed the chain OF the Es-\ntrella, which he also cleared OF some parties,\n\n\ndrove the rebels out of Guarda, and imme-\ndiately moving on Celorico, threatened the\n\n\nrear of the Marquis of Chaves, and probably\n\n\ndetermined his retreat. Under the clrcum-\n\n\nstances of the season, the nature OF the cnun-\ntry, and the warfare which he has had to\ncontend, the movements seem to have been\nJ made with AS much rapdity as success.\n! \"The province of Mimic has continued Sc\n! cure-few triAing attacks made on the north\n,, part of the line of the remega having beer\n\n\nrepulsed with loss\"\n\n\n\"London, Jan.
