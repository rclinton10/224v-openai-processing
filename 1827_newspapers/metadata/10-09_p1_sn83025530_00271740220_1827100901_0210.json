Stone, Esq. editor ofMe N I, &. .4do.\n\n\nSir: You lament the want of direct ana correct\ninformation upon the condition and wants o Greece,\nand you have reason to do so, nor you alone, but\n\n\npoor Greece has reason bitterly to lament that her\nsituation is not known in America for had it been\nAmericans, by applying the means which they have\nsent here in different manner, might have been\nthe means Of saving her from destruction. Greece,\nmy dear sir, is in deplorabe state-it is useless to\nconceal truth her enemies without ignorant\nand weak, but her enemies within are strong and\nterrible; the Turk brings trouble and distress upon\nthe country. but the Greek brings teniod misery,\nwOe and ruin. The accursed intrigues and Jealousy,\nthe avarice and lust of power of her civil and militia.\n\n\nry arstocracy have brought the country to the brink\nof ruin. from which miracle only save her, and\nthat miracle would be the repentance and better\nconduct of these men. Look, sir, at he state OF\nthe Peloponessus there YOU see the flag of liberty\nwaving upon the walls Of three proud fortresses !;\nbut these iorresses are the of intrigue. OF\nplotting of secret. nay, Of open internal war. The\nother night, while the army of the Pacha was with\nin eight hours march of this place, was aroused\nby the roar of cannon, and the rattlng of musket-\nry; arme myselfin the thought that the Turks\nhad made sudden assault upon the place. aud\nwas astonohed to find no movement on the part OF\n\n\nthe inhabitants-each remained still i'll his house,\n. as though aware of what was going on ; and soon\n= learned that Colocor0n, with a band OF soldiers,\nhad assaulted the castle, in hopes to master IT,\n, and make himself independent, both by It's pos\n\n\nsession and that of the treasures Of DllyaDs, which\n\n\nhe knew were concealed here This is the man\n= whom see YOU hold high in esteem in America, fol\nhis courage and patriotism =! Match me, ye Gods\n\n\nmatch me another man who has drawn upon TN\n\n\nPeloponessus so many mlserles Coocoruni.\n\n\nThey talk of Ibrahim Pacha he has ruined and\n\n\ndriven from their homes thousands Of ptaaantrv--\n: Coocotron has ground them to the dust. and wrun!\ne from them their little gain BY his enormous eSac\nr tons the Pacha. has defeated the soltiery---Coo\n\n\ncoron has paralyzed them: the Pacha has opcnl\n: assaulted and taken towns from his enem'es-Coo\n\n\ncotroni has worked to gain hy intrigue; and assault\n\n\ned at midnight castles and towns held By men ACTIN\nunder the orders of government the Pacha has dis\n- trcssed the government by hts movements aud depre\ndations--Coortroni has still more distressed it b.\nN his demands for pay and rations for armies whlc\nhe never raised by his intrigue by his secret opposi\n- ton and open war.
