A still larger portion is so en-\ncumbered with debts due to the merchants IN the\nmother country, that mortgages are held there upon\nalmost all the crops, which are accordingly trans\nmitted to England. In short, such is the weight\nand pressure Of the debts due upon the plantations\nthat the income is drained to supply the English\ncreditor, and nothing remains for transportation\nelsewhere than to the mother country. In conflr-\nnation of this fact, we have the authority OF most\nrespectable American merchant who has been re-\nsiding in one Of West india Islands, and has re-\nturned since the operation Of the act of Parliament\ncommenced. He states that op the 5th OF January,\n1926, notice was given to the commanders OF seye-\nraj American vessels then in port, that they would\nbe permitted 10 clear out for any part OF the world\nEXCEPT Great Britain. Not one OF them made use\nof the permission nor, he SAYS, would one OF them\nduring the year. And why not For the simple\nreason that cargo cannot be procured for any 9th\n\n\ner part of the world except Great Britain; and\nthere they cannot 20. Thus, then, it will be seen\nthat this great magnanimity on the part OF GIeat\nBritain consists in rendering to us trade which\nby the circumstances Of .thc colonies themselves is\nla perfect nuity and requiring from us IN return\nfor such erfreme iiberality the enjoyment OF per-\nfeet and effective commerce. We trust that nell\nther the people nor the government of this country\nwill be gulled by so palpabe an artlfice. We re-\nauire but fair and honorable recprocty we ask no\n\n\navor; we claim no privileges for which we are un\nwilling to give an equivalent; we would be will\nling TO sacrifice something to remove this bone OF\ncontention; but we would not submit to sacrifice the\ndignity and honor of the country to accept the in\nestimable oHer Of nu'luy as a boon journal.",

They con-\ntended that the unapplied balances Of the Sinking\nfund of any one year should continue, without\nlimitation, to be charges upon the Treasury until\nredeemed. Mr.. Sprague refuted this assumption\nin the cearest manner. He showed that the prac-\ntice of Mr.. Crawford had been to carry the unap-\npiled balances of the Sinking fund into the Ways\nand Means of succeeding years; that a proper\nconstruction Of the acts of l795, 1902 and 1917,\nwarranted him in doing so; and that there could\nbe no reason for throwing upon the treasury now,\nthe charges which properly belonged only to the\nperiod OF MIR.

Not one OF them made use\nof the permission nor, he SAYS, would one OF them\nduring the year.

M'Lane and the opposi,\ntion party. to establish new doctrine in regard\nto the Sinking fund.- which certainly might occasion\nsome embarrassment at the Treasury. They con-\ntended that the unapplied balances Of the Sinking\nfund of any one year should continue, without\nlimitation, to be charges upon the Treasury until\nredeemed. Mr.. Sprague refuted this assumption\nin the cearest manner. He showed that the prac-\ntice of Mr.. Crawford had been to carry the unap-\npiled balances of the Sinking fund into the Ways\nand Means of succeeding years; that a proper\nconstruction Of the acts of l795, 1902 and 1917,\nwarranted him in doing so; and that there could\nbe no reason for throwing upon the treasury now,\nthe charges which properly belonged only to the\nperiod OF MIR. Monroe's administration. hut adopt\nwhat construction may, it is demonstrabe, and\nwas even admitted by Mr.. M'Lane, that the Trea-\n! sufy is in more unembarrassed condition than it\nhas been at any time during the last seven years.\nSuch is the result of clear head, honestly and\n! laborousy directed to the important ard difficult\nduty Of experimenting the Treasury.

Dem. Press.\nVirginia Senator.-It seems that Mr.. TYLER.\n| the newly elected Senator from Virginia, some\ntime since expressed his opinion that Mr.. Clay\nacted correctly in supporting Mr. Adams and accep-\nting the office OF Secretary of State. The disclosure\nof this fact has filled the Jacksonians with horror\nand overwhelmed them with dismay; and, as is\ntheir custom, they have denounced Mr. Tyler in\nthe most opprobrous terms. They accuse him of\ngross deception and duplicity in the language he\nheld during the Senatorial canvass. For my part.\ncan perceive nothing of this. Mr.. Tyler may\nrespect Mr.. Adams and Mr.. Clay, and yet be op-\nposed to their great leading measures This, how.\never, does not satisfy the Jack sonians.\n\n\nman must hate and vilify both Mr.. Adams\nand MIR. Clay personally, before he can find favor\nIn the eyes OF the present opposition.\n\n\n| am not surprised that this kind OF rancour\nshould exist only marvel that it should be\navowed. 1 can inform those furious politicians\nthat it is bad policy in them to denounce Mr.. ~\nTer upon this ground.
