December 6th, 1896\" where she\nRad. for some time, been on a visit to the\nvenerable and excellent Lafayette. We have\nmuch pleasure in submitting the following\nextracts. They rub out foul calumny\nwhich, we arc at loss 70 know upon what\nauthority, has been extensively circulated\nagainst the American people.\n\n\n\"By the American papers | see, letter\nsaid to be written by very respectable gen\nsleman, giving an account OF a visit to La\ngrange among numerous errors in this pro\nduction, there is one which has given Gen\neral LatuYcnc real pain. 1t is where tn,\nwriter SAYS, he is Informed, that nine appli\ncations had been made to the General TO\nmoney, the preceding week, by young mel\nfrom the United States. Last night the Gen\nsaid, with much animation, that this was a\ngreat mistake as ever was made, and tina\nhe had never had single application OF tina\nnature; that the Young Americans who hat\ncalled upon him, had uniformly conducte\nthemselves with the greatest propriety, an\nchat there was no foundation whatever for th\nreport\n\n\nal have, says the.letter writer, seen enoug\nof other parts of the world, to teach me\nlove my own country more, and to estimat\nits advantages higher every day. Ours ma\nemphatically be called the Land of Libert,\nThe truth is, we have no such freedom, an\nSO little opportunity of contrasting our COZ\ndition with other countries, that we do M\nsufficiently appreciate our happiness. III\nzeal for, and love of country, feel, make\nme anxious that the above declaration OF OF\nbeloved General, may be given in refutatic\nOf the libel which has been published\"",
