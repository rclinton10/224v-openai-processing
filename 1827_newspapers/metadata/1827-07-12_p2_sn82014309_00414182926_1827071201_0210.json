With these elements, physical and mora why should we fail !- Nor has the strength of conviction abated by the dscouragng predictions of the nlid and interested. These have not been wanting in all stages of ona progress; and the failure of arms, in both wars well of our arts had been confidently fore told.

But they came forward with no doubtful pro- ject. They were sustained by the experience of all countries and especially of that from which we sprung And now the very great success which has attended those branches of our manufactures which were ade- quatey protected enables add that of own testimony the wisdom of self defence and protec ton.\n\n Notwithstanding the new markets which have been created, the wants which have been supplied, and the animation which has been given to labor, the foes ofthe American system continue their opposition with perseverance worthy of better cause Avaing themselves of the irrations and divisions ncdenttoa late contested eecton and enstng under the banners of distinguished name they have taken fresh cour- age and assa the further progress ot our manutac- lures with renovated vgor. Prior to that event, they had contented themselves with controverng the p0t- cy of encouragement; and no statesman m congress had been seen bold enough seriously to question the right ofCongress afford it. But the legislature ofa distinguished state after long deberation and mature consideration, has solemny resolved that Con- gress does not possess the to counteract oregn legislation by laws of self protection. From the very commencement of the government and throughout all the stages Of its existence in peace and m war, that power has been asserted and exercised. 1t is delega ted by more than one clause in the Constitution.

But, faithful to measures, let firmly meet concert and cooperation the other sde by concert and cooperation on ours Let oppose mind to mind, and exertion to exertion and if we must fa-if the bright prospects which lie before us to be dsspaed and destroyed let there be no occasion for representing ourselves. If our op- ponents can make themselves the majority, however much we may deplore the issue of the struggle, we will bow with submission and deference to the will of the majority. If, as hope, our system is preserved, and improved will now hazard the prediction, that less than 20 years the value of our exported manu factures will exceed in amount that of all the exports of raw produce from country. ,H@\n\n To me it has been source of the greatest satsfac ton, that have ever been an humble co-operator with the representation from Pennsylvania in supporting the good cause. only seconded the efficient and able exertiop of her distinguished sons, some of whom represented this city, Indeed, throughout public service in the national councils, which commenced more that 20 years ago. has been my happiness nev- CT differ with that state any great measure ot na- tional policy. will not make an exception of the Missouri question, because agreed with her in the abstract on the subject of slavery, and all the prae- tical and constitutional means of riddng the country of it's evils and she ultimately hailed the amicabe set clement of that threatening question, with patriotic joy. that was difference in relation to men, not measures.

Prison at hard labor. There he was found to be very obstinate and refractory and constantly using threats of revenging himself when he should be released. He is said, to have boasted among his comrades that he had sent more men into eternity than any convict who had ever been in our peniten- tiary. After his discharge he took passage in the brig Francis, for Savannah, but as he was about to embark he was recognized and immediate notice given to her owner, who very prudently had him and his baggage put on shore. We next hear of Tardy in Charles ton, S. c. where he took forcible possession of pilot boat lying in the harbor, and with two blacks, was about to put to sea on piratical expedition, but was discovered, pur- sued, and brought back, and notwithstand- ing this act and information immediately sent to the Mayor of Charleston, of Tardy's character and former crimes, we now hear 0f his most horrid and internal deed on board the brig Crawford. How he obtained his liberty or escaped the death so often due to his crimes, let those who have charge of the public safety tell us.\n\n Tardy was Frenchman by birth, man of small size, dark complexion. about 55 years of age at his death; while on board the schooner Regulator, & at the time he took passage in the brig Francis, wore blue frock coat, and generally carried a small cane, had a genteel appearance and good address; spoke several languages, and was capable of forging any papers he might find necessary.\n\n He was cold blooded pirate, and has un questionably been guilty of and accessary to as many murders as any villain on record. The extent of his crimes were only known\n\n \n\n to make us mourn over the depravity of hu- man nature.--When a man can in cool blood murder deliberately, and that, while pro- fessing to aid fellow being in the agonies caused by himself, (as in the case of the German passenger in the Regulatory or. after shift the punishment due to him. self on an innocent negro, as in the case of Capt. Latham, he is gnilty of crimes too black to be believed, were not the evidence too positive to admit of doubt.\n\n Let those who have in charge the revision of criminal system. reflect well how they will dispose of such characters, and those in authority be careful how they extend their pardon to such internal beings.\n\n r From tue National IntelRgsncr.\n\n We have observed vague story coursing through public prints, that General JACKSON had challenged MT.

Not ourselves seeing how these eminent citizens could well have come in contact, whilst we give the rumor as we found it, we could not bring ourselves to be- lieye that there was any possible color for the story. We do not now believe that Gener- al Jackson has challenged MT. Southard.\n\n But from an artclein the Nashville Repub- lican, which we have seen in the columns of the Richmond Enquirer, we are not so snre that there is not some color for the story. In this article MT. Secretary Southard is placed Y\" in the ranks of vituperators\" of General Jackson. It is apparent, that, in some man. ner or other, MT.

Mr..Brunnel, Jun. quickly descended to his aid. and succeeded in rescuing him from his periious situation. at the moment that his strength was almost exhausted. From calcu- latiOns made by inc engineer, from the prog ress of the water in the shaft, it IS supposed that about cubcal foot ofthe earth under the river must have fallen into the tunnel, where it had been recently excavated, and before the patchwork had been raised to supp port it. It is attributed to what miners call \"a fault\" in the sOl-that is, the meeting of the two layers ofearth, where the water has always the least difficulty ininsinuating itself. The engineer does not state his apprehension of any obstruction. arising from the accident, to the progress of the work. He expects to have the water all pumped out in a week or two. and be then able to resume his opera tions. The greatest difficulty with which he will have to contend will be, the dread which this alarm will have left oh the minds of the workmen. As is generally the case on such occasions, the accounts which circulated in the neighbourhood were fall of fexaggeration. It is d matter of congratu.ation, that when the lives of so many were suddenly placed in such jeopardy, none were lost.

These have not been wanting in all stages of ona progress; and the failure of arms, in both wars well of our arts had been confidently fore told.

But they came forward with no doubtful pro- ject. They were sustained by the experience of all countries and especially of that from which we sprung And now the very great success which has attended those branches of our manufactures which were ade- quatey protected enables add that of own testimony the wisdom of self defence and protec ton.\n\n Notwithstanding the new markets which have been created, the wants which have been supplied, and the animation which has been given to labor, the foes ofthe American system continue their opposition with perseverance worthy of better cause Avaing themselves of the irrations and divisions ncdenttoa late contested eecton and enstng under the banners of distinguished name they have taken fresh cour- age and assa the further progress ot our manutac- lures with renovated vgor. Prior to that event, they had contented themselves with controverng the p0t- cy of encouragement; and no statesman m congress had been seen bold enough seriously to question the right ofCongress afford it. But the legislature ofa distinguished state after long deberation and mature consideration, has solemny resolved that Con- gress does not possess the to counteract oregn legislation by laws of self protection. From the very commencement of the government and throughout all the stages Of its existence in peace and m war, that power has been asserted and exercised. 1t is delega ted by more than one clause in the Constitution.

The power to oreguate our foreign commerce Is penary clear and explicit; and, 1.-the clause which\n\n \n\n guage inadequate to supply the appropriate terms. Under another clause, also full and explicit, the pow CT IS granted to lay mposts, without limitation as to a. mOun and has been exercised to extent far beyond the wishes of the friends of the American system to ap- ply it.\n\n hope the vigor of this new attack upon the system will be met by corresponding vigor in it's defence Let treat antagonists with the greatest respect and be tender of their preudices. But, faithful to measures, let firmly meet concert and cooperation the other sde by concert and cooperation on ours Let oppose mind to mind, and exertion to exertion and if we must fa-if the bright prospects which lie before us to be dsspaed and destroyed let there be no occasion for representing ourselves.

Itis generally feared the citadel must fall, as it is said black flag was flying upon it. Col. Fabyicr commands it, and it is well known that no quarter will be given, even if surrendered, the garrison may make a despe- rate sortie, simultaneously with an attack from Karaiskaki upon the land side.\n\n The Turks are making their utmost efforts to send large force into the MOrea, this cam paign but it is evident they grow weaker every year, and should the Greek Revolution last seven gears longer, it will ruin the Turkish Empire. The Porte will notlisten to the interference of any foreign powers. They say the Greeks are their subjects, and they will grant them no terms whatever, but will have their com plete submission.

Prison at hard labor. There he was found to be very obstinate and refractory and constantly using threats of revenging himself when he should be released. He is said, to have boasted among his comrades that he had sent more men into eternity than any convict who had ever been in our peniten- tiary. After his discharge he took passage in the brig Francis, for Savannah, but as he was about to embark he was recognized and immediate notice given to her owner, who very prudently had him and his baggage put on shore. We next hear of Tardy in Charles ton, S. c. where he took forcible possession of pilot boat lying in the harbor, and with two blacks, was about to put to sea on piratical expedition, but was discovered, pur- sued, and brought back, and notwithstand- ing this act and information immediately sent to the Mayor of Charleston, of Tardy's character and former crimes, we now hear 0f his most horrid and internal deed on board the brig Crawford. How he obtained his liberty or escaped the death so often due to his crimes, let those who have charge of the public safety tell us.\n\n Tardy was Frenchman by birth, man of small size, dark complexion. about 55 years of age at his death; while on board the schooner Regulator, & at the time he took passage in the brig Francis, wore blue frock coat, and generally carried a small cane, had a genteel appearance and good address; spoke several languages, and was capable of forging any papers he might find necessary.\n\n He was cold blooded pirate, and has un questionably been guilty of and accessary to as many murders as any villain on record. The extent of his crimes were only known\n\n \n\n to make us mourn over the depravity of hu- man nature.--When a man can in cool blood murder deliberately, and that, while pro- fessing to aid fellow being in the agonies caused by himself, (as in the case of the German passenger in the Regulatory or. after shift the punishment due to him. self on an innocent negro, as in the case of Capt. Latham, he is gnilty of crimes too black to be believed, were not the evidence too positive to admit of doubt.\n\n Let those who have in charge the revision of criminal system. reflect well how they will dispose of such characters, and those in authority be careful how they extend their pardon to such internal beings.\n\n r From tue National IntelRgsncr.\n\n We have observed vague story coursing through public prints, that General JACKSON had challenged MT. SourHARD, the Secretary of the Navy. Not ourselves seeing how these eminent citizens could well have come in contact, whilst we give the rumor as we found it, we could not bring ourselves to be- lieye that there was any possible color for the story. We do not now believe that Gener- al Jackson has challenged MT. Southard.\n\n But from an artclein the Nashville Repub- lican, which we have seen in the columns of the Richmond Enquirer, we are not so snre that there is not some color for the story. In this article MT. Secretary Southard is placed Y\" in the ranks of vituperators\" of General Jackson. It is apparent, that, in some man. ner or other, MT.
