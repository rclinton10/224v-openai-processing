Six unfortunate vic- tims, as has been stated, were condemned to suffer de0th, and about two hundred others were sentenced to make good the time they had lost, and at the expiration of their ser vice, to have their heads shaved, and to be drunImed out of the camp!\n\n In the midst of the congratulations of vic tory when every heart was elate with honest pride, and confident anticipation, these delu- ded men-when danger was past, and their example could no longer injure, were sent to execution. It was remorseless and bloody deed.\n\n It is, we know, said, in defence of Gen. Jackson, that his agency in this matter was merely official--and it became his duty to order it carried into effect Not so-Gen. Jackson might have disapproved the finding of the Court. He night at any rate, have suspended the sentence of excution, and re- ferred the matter, as no peril was emminent, to the President. But that day, MT. Madi- son, could not. as Gen. Jackson has since said, look with composure upon blood and carnage\" and perhaps the General thought it safest not to give his brother soldiers the chance of mercy, which such disposition held gout. He therefore shed their blood. Moreover, it is on record, that Gen. Jackson is not always so observant of the findings of Courts Martial, as to abide fsimplicitly by them. When the Court that tried Arbuth- not and Ambrister refused to touch their lives Gen. Jackson annuled the proceedings with single dash ofhis pen, and ordered the prisoners to instantsdeath-of his mere will, and good pleasure.\n\n The official record of the trial,the sentence, and the order for execution, have been re- gently published in the Washington papers,& bear out this summary of the transaction. We shall, probably, hereafter republish them Tn order that those among our readers who may prefer Gen.Jackson, shall at least,not do so for want of knowledge ofhis character and acts.\n\n The detachment to which the men belong ed was stationed in the Creek Country. The law of the United States, actually in exist ence until April 1874, did limit the service of militia drafts to three months and it is prob able, that this detacment and it's officers were lgnorant-indeed, it is solemnly averred that that they did not know of any law authoriz- ing their detention in service more than three months, from the time ofreaching the point ot rendezvous. At any rate, it was proved that the refractory men acted under such an impression; and that as soon as they be- came doubtful of the step they had taken, they We're voluntarily returning to their camp and it was on this voluntary return, that they were made prisoners-subsequent ed-dishonored-and executed\n\n 1t IS, too, with that irreverence for the character of the unequalled and unapproach- able Washington which has led to more than one comparison of living soldiers with him l; sometimes said that Washington had caused militia men to be executed during the reyolu- tionary struggle. Thisoslander, for so it must be called is completely put at rest, by the annexed communication, written by one ! who is, as he signs himself, private militio- man, and whose cautious and discreet charac- ter are vouchers to us, who know him, for the accuracy of his statements.\n\n For the Ne,O- Fork Ame,fcon. In the labOured yindicatiOns that have ap- peared of the conduct of Gen. Jackson in causing six militia men to be tried and shot for assertion, the conduct of General Wash ington in the war of the revolution, has been quoted in his justification. The instances given appear to me to be unfortunately selec- ted-viz. the one at Fort Schuyler, where it is said thirty men went off in body, and \"being pursued, 16 Ofthem were overtaken, and thirteen of the sixteen were instantly kill led\" And the mutiny in the Jersey line, in 17sl, when about one hundred and sixty of that line mutinied, and laid down their arms three of the ring leaders, were selected, condemned bya court martial, and two of them executed.\n\n As to the affair at Fort Schuyler, would remark, that no knowledge of the apprehen- sion or killing of the men was brought home to General Washington, at least, not till after the deed was done. And as to both of the instances which the friends of Gen. Jackson quote in his justification, do we not meet the infererences attempted to be drawn from them when we say, that they were cases of military execution done upon regularly enlist ed and educated soldiers.\n\n If the inhuman conduct of Gen. Jackson could be justified by inhuman conduct in oth- ers,and if his friends seek for such iustfca- tion in the annals of the war of the revolution, they mast find parallel cases and furnish us with them from examples of military execu- ton done at chat time upon militiamen. Such instances may possibly exist. If any are found, let them be brought home to Washington before he is instanced in SUD- port of the conduct of Gen. Jackson.\n\n But am confident none such will be found. The militia of the revolution were never subject to all the seventies of martial law. They were called out for emergencies, were kept together by their patriotism, and dispersed q may almost say,) at their own",

The atmosphere being ve- ry moist, the dampness of the cabin floor for : want of better conductor, might probably aid in carrying it to the windows.\n\n \"Being all in our births, enveloped in beds and bedding ofnon conducting materials, we reposed in comparative safety, while the deathly bolt careered around us with fierce & restless energy.

We had chain conduc- tor on board; but it not being the season to expect much lightning, and the first shock coming on quite suddenly, it was not up at the time.

I happen 1 ed to be in the cabin with another passenger: a ball of fire seemed 10 dart down before us 7: at the same time the glass in the round-house came rattllng down below.e Those on deck agreed that the whole ship appeared to be in blaze, from the viyidness of the principal flash, which they distinctly saw darting down the conductor, and agitatiug the water. All parts of the ship, as before, were filled with smoke smelling strongly of sulphur.\n\n ''The ship was again thoroughly examined. The conductor had been rent to pieces by the discharge and scattered to the winds :: small fragments of it were found on deck in saving the ship it had literally yielded itselfto the fury of the blast. The pointed rod was l found to be fused and shortened several inch es, and covered with dark coating some of the links snapped off and others melted.-The whole operation was sngularly striking, and affords another of those rare cases where the conductor yielded to the violence of the shock, while it effectually averted the holt from the object it was designed to protect. \" MT. Ross, the second officer, was pros trated and three of the men struck, but none much injured.

WEBSTER could have quashed it twenty times over, if he would have deigned to avail himself of it's hideous flaws. For example It recites that the great western road has been constructed, and manufactures been sustained, < to the great damage and lnJury of'' the states Of Ohio and Nea0- York, when 1t isnotorious that, instead of reading thus 1t should read '' to the great damage and injury of the Combination\" So glaring bIunder as this could hardly have been expected in bill drawn up by the accomplished senator ot New-York, whom we confess we have very badly represented on this occasion.

WEBSTER rose for the defendant In case ofthis magnitude, he said, in which his honoured client was to be convicted, for dO- ing those things which he had done often, and with the advice of those, too, whom he had always reckoned among his earliest and best friends, he hoped, before taking up the pre- else question, he might be indulged with one or two preliminary and introductory remarks The indictment he said, charged that his client had, with the implements aforesaid, in manner aforesaid, made and constructed a certain public road, viz. in Ohio aforesaid, &c.\n\n In the first place, MT. W. said, he hunbly hoped, that it would not, on this occasion, be urged against his client, that roads were mala in se-things, in their own nature, grlevous and oppressive. The learned prosecutor, he was sure, would admit that a good road, in and of itself, was good thing; although,per- haps, he did not himself always prefer to pursue his Ova course in the most beaten track. Charges, however, like the present, had sometimes, and from some quarters, been made against the client, in language ap- proriate to cases of malicious miSchiet, or even of still more aggravating offences. They had contained clauses \" wickedly contriving and confederating,\" of\" fraudulently and craftily designing to undermine the prosperity of the People,\" Ic. &c.-and some of them he believed, had run so high as to lay the charge \" with malice aforethought.\" And in these cases the accusation had been so undis- tinguishing, that especially when certain oth- CT things well known, were taken into con- sideration, it left very strong impression that.a road, itself, was regarded as nuisance. This, he supposed, must be from the power ot association. Having connected the idea of rood roads with the other idea of unconstitu- tional assumption and political tyranny, both became equally obnoxious He reccollected to have been informed that some wit, cer- tainly with too little respect and reverence for the grave doctrines ofa particular school, had made picture ofa country citizen, ,strug- gling and fioundering along in one ofthose re- servoirs of mud and water, by an antiphrasis called roads somewhere between the Kappa hammock and the Potomac, (perhaps about Dumfres, } his wheels fairly up to the hub, wagon completely stalled, horses jaded and exhausted till they would not bring their shoulders to the collar, halfthe value of the cargo already consumed in expense of the transportation. and fifty miles of equally smooth, dry, and com tortable road before him.

Ramsey of CharIestOn) from the mouth of an officer of the United States engineer corps, then at that station, with all its particulars He stated that Charles DickersOn threw a. way his fire, that Gen. Jackson then advan- ced, and presented the pistol to the mans head, and with an oath bid him make con- sessions or die. DickersOn refused Jack son took down his pistol, picked the flint, and presented it a second time, with similar re- marks, and with the like effect; and after repeating this several times, finally shot the man dead on the spot. Several gentlemen in this county, have heard the same story the last winter, with all the circumstances at tending it, from two wealthy, respectable and intelligent merchants, natives of New-Jersey who now live in Nashville, ,and have long lived there.\n\n Appalling as this statement is, we have circumstance to add to it, which made our in- formant's blood run cold. when he heard it, as we'll it might---SoOn after the duel, Jackson wrote letter to Samuel Pryor,a mo- ted gamester, and crony of the General then residing in this State, giving him an ac- count of it.

This ship has twice been struck with lightning on her present voy age from New-York. On the 18th day of A. pril, our third day out, about half past five in the morning. being in our births, we were reused by the sound like the report of can non close to our ears. In moment we were all out, and the cabin and all parts ofthe ship were filled with dense smoke, having a strong smell of sulphur. From the deck word was quickly passed that the ship was on fire. The consternation which for some time prevailed may be more easily imma- gined than described. Every one ran on deck with a full impression that the ship was in blaze. It had been broad day, but so dark, SO dense, and so close upon us were the clouds, as to produce almost the obscurity of night. There was just suffi- cient light to give bold relief to every ob- .ect in the appalling scene. The rain pour ed down in torrents, mingled with hail stones as large as filberts, which lay fully an inch thick. Over head blazed the lightning on all sides accompanied by reports almost simulta- neously, ,thus evincing its nearness. The sea ran mountains highland the ship was tossed from one sea to another with incredible rapidity. One appearance was peculiarly re- markable. The temperature of the water was at \"A degrees of Fahrenheit, while that of the atmosphere was down to 48. This pro- duced a copious evaporation, and caused i'm mense clouds of vapour to rise, which ascend ing in columns all around us, exhibited the appearance ofinnumerable pillars supporting a massive canopy ofclouds. These phenom- ena, are extremely unusual, no person on board ever having witnessed any thing like it before. In all directions might be seen wa ter spouts, which, rising fearfully to the clouds seemed actually to present to the eye com bination of all the elements for the destruc- ton of every thing on the face of the deep. Altogether the scene was one of awful sub- limity, which baffies description. Amid this scene ofimpending ruin, when all nature was in the utmost confusion-when nautical sci ence and experience could avail nothing while an irrisistible element was playing about us, and the ship seemed on the very verge of fate; when, in short, dismay and dispair was reflected from every other countenance- nothing could exceed the calmness with which every order was given, to examine the ship in prospect of meeting fire below deck nothing could equal the manner in which ev- cry one was encouraged, with the hope of security, even beyond what in reason could be expected; thus but echo the senti- mcnts of all on board.\n\n But I hasten to my narrative.

It could not be denied. All the world knew it. If there were guilt in it, his client was notorious ly, and beyond the power of contradiction, guilty.\n\n One more remark, of preliminary sort, Mir. Webster said, he wished permission to make. Perhaps it might not be that there was much in It, in these days of the rule and reign of abstract principles and metaphysical theories. Still it might be worth just the mentioning, accidentally, and, as it were, by ] the way, that those, on whom this breach of the Constitution had been perpetrated, and whose rights had been wantonly invaded, by his valued uncle and client, did not seem greatly to complain. Indeed they did some thing more than bear their injuries with pa tience. They were so ncOnsiderate, so per verse, so strangely blind to their own inter est and happiness, that they absolutely welcomed the usurpation,& hailed 1t with joy and exclamation. The chains, thus imposed on them, and which the Doctors of the meta physical school tell them are chains of iron, cramping their limbs and their liberties. they regard only as links of social, municipal, commercial, and political intercourse, more precious and valuable than chains of gold.\n\n It would be remembered, MT. w. said, that this was the Ohio case not the case of the Dismal S,camp: though in that case, also, he believed, the money had been receiUed and expended but, to preserve the principle invi- Olate, it was received under sort of nretert, namely, that furnishing the means to do a thing was no participation in the doing of it. Bat it acas received. The good dollars were all counted and paid out at the Treasury i; and he had observed that this case was very seldom quoted as one of the mischievious pre- cedents. There had been much less frequent mention oft, he suggested, than of the llli- nois Canal; nor did its passage through con gress draw such briny tears down venerable and patriotic faces, as flowed conspicuously at the last Session, when the harbor, piers,& 1 lighthouse bill travelled its way through the two Houses.\n\n Here, as the learned Counsel seemed to dwell 80 long in his preliminaries, the Court intimated they must rise, but said, after the manner of Lord Chancellor Eldon, that they would hear him, further, another day, and in the mean time carefully read over all the papers in the cause.\n\n And so the Court was adjourned until the next time of meeting, and the labor of our Reporter ends for this day.

Jackson aud the Miiitia.-It is, perhaps not generally known, though as indicative of the real nature of Gen. Jacksons pretensions which are strictly of a military character, to support for the presidency, it should be that great efforts are made to obtain, and much reliance is placed upon, the favor of militia soldiers and officers and sOldiers-as such not in their capacity as citizens, not as farm- CTS, mechanics, or professional men, interest ed in the preservation of civil order and free dom, but as soldiers, banded together under leaders, with arms in their hands, and with military glory as their incentive. The hero 1 of New Orleans, not the Statesman, is tke cry, and amid the clangor of arms, and the ! rustling of banners, and the swelling of mar tial minstrelsy, all arrayed to do honour to the chieftain; the still small whispers of req son, the warning voice of all the past, the prophetic misgiving of even Jefferson for the future, all are attempted to be silenced. Under these circumstances it cannot be mis- placed to callthe attention of the militia in particular, and of OUT readers generally, to the treatment by Gen. Jackson of certain militia under his command at the close of the war. In doing so, we shall not, we trust, be understood as upholding any sickly doctrines about the hardship of enforcing discipline a. gainst the militia when in service we too well know its value-we have had too much occasion to see it's necessity to commit any such blunder. But we do mean to say, that in the case we are about to refer to, if the official documents do not Lie, there was, under all the circumstances of the case, uncalled for severity, nay, unjustAable cruelty,in the ex- cautions ordered and fulfilled.\n\n Briefly then to the facts; Six militia men were by order of Gen. Jackson carrying into effect the sentence of a Court Martial, shot on the 26th of Jan. 1915; eighteen days after the battle of New Orleans, and ;hlrty two days after the signing ofthe treaty of peace between the U. States and Great Britain. The circumstances which led to their con- demnation and death, and the degredation of their companions, are thus stated:--\n\n A detachment of Tennessee militia was drafted by order of Governor Blount in May 1874. They arrived at the place of the rendezvous on the goth of June. The pri- yates were told by their oflicers-A Captain Str0ther and lieutenant, whose name is not",

Six unfortunate vic- tims, as has been stated, were condemned to suffer de0th, and about two hundred others were sentenced to make good the time they had lost, and at the expiration of their ser vice, to have their heads shaved, and to be drunImed out of the camp!\n\n In the midst of the congratulations of vic tory when every heart was elate with honest pride, and confident anticipation, these delu- ded men-when danger was past, and their example could no longer injure, were sent to execution. It was remorseless and bloody deed.\n\n It is, we know, said, in defence of Gen. Jackson, that his agency in this matter was merely official--and it became his duty to order it carried into effect Not so-Gen. Jackson might have disapproved the finding of the Court. He night at any rate, have suspended the sentence of excution, and re- ferred the matter, as no peril was emminent, to the President. But that day, MT. Madi- son, could not. as Gen. Jackson has since said, look with composure upon blood and carnage\" and perhaps the General thought it safest not to give his brother soldiers the chance of mercy, which such disposition held gout. He therefore shed their blood. Moreover, it is on record, that Gen. Jackson is not always so observant of the findings of Courts Martial, as to abide fsimplicitly by them. When the Court that tried Arbuth- not and Ambrister refused to touch their lives Gen. Jackson annuled the proceedings with single dash ofhis pen, and ordered the prisoners to instantsdeath-of his mere will, and good pleasure.\n\n The official record of the trial,the sentence, and the order for execution, have been re- gently published in the Washington papers,& bear out this summary of the transaction. We shall, probably, hereafter republish them Tn order that those among our readers who may prefer Gen.Jackson, shall at least,not do so for want of knowledge ofhis character and acts.\n\n The detachment to which the men belong ed was stationed in the Creek Country. The law of the United States, actually in exist ence until April 1874, did limit the service of militia drafts to three months and it is prob able, that this detacment and it's officers were lgnorant-indeed, it is solemnly averred that that they did not know of any law authoriz- ing their detention in service more than three months, from the time ofreaching the point ot rendezvous. At any rate, it was proved that the refractory men acted under such an impression; and that as soon as they be- came doubtful of the step they had taken, they We're voluntarily returning to their camp and it was on this voluntary return, that they were made prisoners-subsequent ed-dishonored-and executed\n\n 1t IS, too, with that irreverence for the character of the unequalled and unapproach- able Washington which has led to more than one comparison of living soldiers with him l; sometimes said that Washington had caused militia men to be executed during the reyolu- tionary struggle. Thisoslander, for so it must be called is completely put at rest, by the annexed communication, written by one ! who is, as he signs himself, private militio- man, and whose cautious and discreet charac- ter are vouchers to us, who know him, for the accuracy of his statements.\n\n For the Ne,O- Fork Ame,fcon. In the labOured yindicatiOns that have ap- peared of the conduct of Gen. Jackson in causing six militia men to be tried and shot for assertion, the conduct of General Wash ington in the war of the revolution, has been quoted in his justification. The instances given appear to me to be unfortunately selec- ted-viz. the one at Fort Schuyler, where it is said thirty men went off in body, and \"being pursued, 16 Ofthem were overtaken, and thirteen of the sixteen were instantly kill led\" And the mutiny in the Jersey line, in 17sl, when about one hundred and sixty of that line mutinied, and laid down their arms three of the ring leaders, were selected, condemned bya court martial, and two of them executed.\n\n As to the affair at Fort Schuyler, would remark, that no knowledge of the apprehen- sion or killing of the men was brought home to General Washington, at least, not till after the deed was done. And as to both of the instances which the friends of Gen. Jackson quote in his justification, do we not meet the infererences attempted to be drawn from them when we say, that they were cases of military execution done upon regularly enlist ed and educated soldiers.\n\n If the inhuman conduct of Gen. Jackson could be justified by inhuman conduct in oth- ers,and if his friends seek for such iustfca- tion in the annals of the war of the revolution, they mast find parallel cases and furnish us with them from examples of military execu- ton done at chat time upon militiamen. Such instances may possibly exist. If any are found, let them be brought home to Washington before he is instanced in SUD- port of the conduct of Gen. Jackson.\n\n But am confident none such will be found. The militia of the revolution were never subject to all the seventies of martial law. They were called out for emergencies, were kept together by their patriotism, and dispersed q may almost say,) at their own",

WEBSTER rose for the defendant In case ofthis magnitude, he said, in which his honoured client was to be convicted, for dO- ing those things which he had done often, and with the advice of those, too, whom he had always reckoned among his earliest and best friends, he hoped, before taking up the pre- else question, he might be indulged with one or two preliminary and introductory remarks The indictment he said, charged that his client had, with the implements aforesaid, in manner aforesaid, made and constructed a certain public road, viz. in Ohio aforesaid, &c.\n\n In the first place, MT. W. said, he hunbly hoped, that it would not, on this occasion, be urged against his client, that roads were mala in se-things, in their own nature, grlevous and oppressive. The learned prosecutor, he was sure, would admit that a good road, in and of itself, was good thing; although,per- haps, he did not himself always prefer to pursue his Ova course in the most beaten track. Charges, however, like the present, had sometimes, and from some quarters, been made against the client, in language ap- proriate to cases of malicious miSchiet, or even of still more aggravating offences. They had contained clauses \" wickedly contriving and confederating,\" of\" fraudulently and craftily designing to undermine the prosperity of the People,\" Ic. &c.-and some of them he believed, had run so high as to lay the charge \" with malice aforethought.\" And in these cases the accusation had been so undis- tinguishing, that especially when certain oth- CT things well known, were taken into con- sideration, it left very strong impression that.a road, itself, was regarded as nuisance. This, he supposed, must be from the power ot association.

            "article": "place tn the year 1906. The record of that bloody transaction, has been in our posses sion. We heard it also in I8I6, at Platts- burgh, (when we were in company with Dr. J. Ramsey of CharIestOn) from the mouth of an officer of the United States engineer corps, then at that station, with all its particulars He stated that Charles DickersOn threw a. way his fire, that Gen. Jackson then advan- ced, and presented the pistol to the mans head, and with an oath bid him make con- sessions or die. DickersOn refused Jack son took down his pistol, picked the flint, and presented it a second time, with similar re- marks, and with the like effect; and after repeating this several times, finally shot the man dead on the spot. Several gentlemen in this county, have heard the same story the last winter, with all the circumstances at tending it, from two wealthy, respectable and intelligent merchants, natives of New-Jersey who now live in Nashville, ,and have long lived there.\n\n Appalling as this statement is, we have circumstance to add to it, which made our in- formant's blood run cold. when he heard it, as we'll it might---SoOn after the duel, Jackson wrote letter to Samuel Pryor,a mo- ted gamester, and crony of the General then residing in this State, giving him an ac- count of it. In that letter the HERO ex pressed himself to this effect. \" I rescrued my fire and achen / did shoot you mag De dsSur ed I left tue d0mned rascal a0eltering in his blood\" It is many years since our informant heard the letter read. But the expressions he says, and we can readily believe it, made an impression on;his mind, ;whch time can not obliterate while memory endures.\"\n\n The foregoing is.copiedffrom the Trenton True American, and may be relied upon as authentically correct. By way fan apology for his cold-booded deed, he at the same time urged that he was justified by the prin- ciples and rules observable by all men who engage in affairs of honour And shall such a man be elevated to the chief magistra- cy of the United States !

This ship has twice been struck with lightning on her present voy age from New-York. On the 18th day of A. pril, our third day out, about half past five in the morning. being in our births, we were reused by the sound like the report of can non close to our ears. In moment we were all out, and the cabin and all parts ofthe ship were filled with dense smoke, having a strong smell of sulphur. From the deck word was quickly passed that the ship was on fire. The consternation which for some time prevailed may be more easily imma- gined than described. Every one ran on deck with a full impression that the ship was in blaze. It had been broad day, but so dark, SO dense, and so close upon us were the clouds, as to produce almost the obscurity of night. There was just suffi- cient light to give bold relief to every ob- .ect in the appalling scene. The rain pour ed down in torrents, mingled with hail stones as large as filberts, which lay fully an inch thick. Over head blazed the lightning on all sides accompanied by reports almost simulta- neously, ,thus evincing its nearness. The sea ran mountains highland the ship was tossed from one sea to another with incredible rapidity. One appearance was peculiarly re- markable. The temperature of the water was at \"A degrees of Fahrenheit, while that of the atmosphere was down to 48. This pro- duced a copious evaporation, and caused i'm mense clouds of vapour to rise, which ascend ing in columns all around us, exhibited the appearance ofinnumerable pillars supporting a massive canopy ofclouds. These phenom- ena, are extremely unusual, no person on board ever having witnessed any thing like it before. In all directions might be seen wa ter spouts, which, rising fearfully to the clouds seemed actually to present to the eye com bination of all the elements for the destruc- ton of every thing on the face of the deep. Altogether the scene was one of awful sub- limity, which baffies description. Amid this scene ofimpending ruin, when all nature was in the utmost confusion-when nautical sci ence and experience could avail nothing while an irrisistible element was playing about us, and the ship seemed on the very verge of fate; when, in short, dismay and dispair was reflected from every other countenance- nothing could exceed the calmness with which every order was given, to examine the ship in prospect of meeting fire below deck nothing could equal the manner in which ev- cry one was encouraged, with the hope of security, even beyond what in reason could be expected; thus but echo the senti- mcnts of all on board.\n\n But I hasten to my narrative.

It must be confessed, Mir. w. said, that his client openly aided and abetted that course of proceeding which had produced these results, and was producing others Ofa like nature. It could not be denied. All the world knew it. If there were guilt in it, his client was notorious ly, and beyond the power of contradiction, guilty.\n\n One more remark, of preliminary sort, Mir. Webster said, he wished permission to make. Perhaps it might not be that there was much in It, in these days of the rule and reign of abstract principles and metaphysical theories. Still it might be worth just the mentioning, accidentally, and, as it were, by ] the way, that those, on whom this breach of the Constitution had been perpetrated, and whose rights had been wantonly invaded, by his valued uncle and client, did not seem greatly to complain. Indeed they did some thing more than bear their injuries with pa tience. They were so ncOnsiderate, so per verse, so strangely blind to their own inter est and happiness, that they absolutely welcomed the usurpation,& hailed 1t with joy and exclamation. The chains, thus imposed on them, and which the Doctors of the meta physical school tell them are chains of iron, cramping their limbs and their liberties. they regard only as links of social, municipal, commercial, and political intercourse, more precious and valuable than chains of gold.\n\n It would be remembered, MT. w. said, that this was the Ohio case not the case of the Dismal S,camp: though in that case, also, he believed, the money had been receiUed and expended but, to preserve the principle invi- Olate, it was received under sort of nretert, namely, that furnishing the means to do a thing was no participation in the doing of it. Bat it acas received. The good dollars were all counted and paid out at the Treasury i; and he had observed that this case was very seldom quoted as one of the mischievious pre- cedents. There had been much less frequent mention oft, he suggested, than of the llli- nois Canal; nor did its passage through con gress draw such briny tears down venerable and patriotic faces, as flowed conspicuously at the last Session, when the harbor, piers,& 1 lighthouse bill travelled its way through the two Houses.\n\n Here, as the learned Counsel seemed to dwell 80 long in his preliminaries, the Court intimated they must rise, but said, after the manner of Lord Chancellor Eldon, that they would hear him, further, another day, and in the mean time carefully read over all the papers in the cause.\n\n And so the Court was adjourned until the next time of meeting, and the labor of our Reporter ends for this day. God save the United States, and the people thereof, who constitute this honorable Court\n\n l From Ghs Ns,o- York Ame,icon.\n\n 1 Gen. Jackson aud the Miiitia.-It is, perhaps not generally known, though as indicative of the real nature of Gen. Jacksons pretensions which are strictly of a military character, to support for the presidency, it should be that great efforts are made to obtain, and much reliance is placed upon, the favor of militia soldiers and officers and sOldiers-as such not in their capacity as citizens, not as farm- CTS, mechanics, or professional men, interest ed in the preservation of civil order and free dom, but as soldiers, banded together under leaders, with arms in their hands, and with military glory as their incentive. The hero 1 of New Orleans, not the Statesman, is tke cry, and amid the clangor of arms, and the ! rustling of banners, and the swelling of mar tial minstrelsy, all arrayed to do honour to the chieftain; the still small whispers of req son, the warning voice of all the past, the prophetic misgiving of even Jefferson for the future, all are attempted to be silenced. Under these circumstances it cannot be mis- placed to callthe attention of the militia in particular, and of OUT readers generally, to the treatment by Gen. Jackson of certain militia under his command at the close of the war. In doing so, we shall not, we trust, be understood as upholding any sickly doctrines about the hardship of enforcing discipline a. gainst the militia when in service we too well know its value-we have had too much occasion to see it's necessity to commit any such blunder. But we do mean to say, that in the case we are about to refer to, if the official documents do not Lie, there was, under all the circumstances of the case, uncalled for severity, nay, unjustAable cruelty,in the ex- cautions ordered and fulfilled.\n\n Briefly then to the facts; Six militia men were by order of Gen. Jackson carrying into effect the sentence of a Court Martial, shot on the 26th of Jan. 1915; eighteen days after the battle of New Orleans, and ;hlrty two days after the signing ofthe treaty of peace between the U. States and Great Britain. The circumstances which led to their con- demnation and death, and the degredation of their companions, are thus stated:--\n\n A detachment of Tennessee militia was drafted by order of Governor Blount in May 1874. They arrived at the place of the rendezvous on the goth of June. The pri- yates were told by their oflicers-A Captain Str0ther and lieutenant, whose name is not",
