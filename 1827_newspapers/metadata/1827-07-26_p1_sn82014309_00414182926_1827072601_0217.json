Their feet when examined by a microscope, are found to have fiat skin or flaps, like the feet of web-foOted animals, ,as ducks and geese; and they have towards the back part or heels, but inside of the skin or flap, two very small toes, so connected with the flap as to draw it close down upon the glass or wall the fly walks on, and to squeeze out the air com pletely, so that there is vacuum made be tween the foot and wall. The heconsequence is, that the air presses the foot on the wall with force greater than the weight of the fly,",

But even if Christianity were out of the question, and if, when had wheeled away the rubbish of the old Pagodas, had nothing bt tier than simple deism to erect in their stead, should still feel some of the anxiety which now ur- ges me. It is necessary to see idoatry, to be fully sensible of its mischievous effects on the human mind. But of all idolatres which I have ever read or heard of, the religion of the Hindoos, in which have taken some pains to inform myself, really appears to me the worst, both in the degrading notions which it gives ofthe Deity in the endless rounds of it's burdensome ceremonies, which occupy the time and distract the thoughts, without either instructing or interesting it's votaries in the filthy acts of uncleanness and cruelty not on- ly permitted but enjoined, and inseparably in- terwoven with those ceremonies in the sys- than any thing else the devil has invented, to destroy the feelings of general benevolence, and to make nine-tenths of mankind the hopeless slaves of the remainder: and in to- tai absence of any system of morals, or any SiuSlc ltSSOH, WHICH Lllc peOple al IafGe ever hear, to live virtuOusly and to do good to each other. do not say, indeed that there are not some scattered lessons of this kind to be- found in their ancient books; but those books are neither accessible to the people at large, nor are these last permitted to read them: and, in general, all the sins which a Sudra is taught to fear, are, killing a COW, offending Brahmin,or neglecting one of the many frivolous rights by which their deities are supposed to be concilated. Accordingly though the general sobriety of the Hindoos, Ia virtue which they possess, in common with most inhabitants of warm clmates) affords a very great facility to the maintenance ofpub- lie order and decorum, realIys have never met with race of men whose standard ol morality is so low, who feel so little apparent shame in being detected in a afaIshood, or so little interest in the sufferings of neighbour not being of their own cast or family whose ordinary and familiar conversation is SO licen. tious or, in the wilder and more lawless districts, who shed blood with so little re.

            "raw_text": "A curious circumstance in Natural History is related in the last number of the American Quarterly Review. The large winged grass hopper, which flutters with SO much vivacity through our meadows during the autumn, feeds upon vegitable matter, and deposits its eggs upon vegitables for the purpose of being supported until matured. Before the grass hopper takes wing, another insect, the ichneu- mon, alights upon its body,and rhrusts under it's skin a number of eggs, by means of tu- bula, awl shaped oviduct.-These eggs slow ly acquire perfection, become living worms, and feed upon the body of the hapless grass hopper, until themselves are ready to take wlng. So admirably do they perform their office, ,that they do not injure the vital organs of the insect they are internally devouring, until they are just ready to change their state; and at the proper season, hundreds of grasshoppers, in this condition, have just strength enough to futter to a tree or fence, and with a dying effort fix their hooked feet so firmly as to retain that position long after death. Examine their bodies at this season, and you will find an empty shell, or one filled with large and active worms, just ready to burst their coverings and become winged insects.\n\n The recently published number of the North American Review supplies us with a. nOther description of natural object, but lit- tie known, to common readers, though said to be familiar to the sight of those who navi- gate between the trophics-the beautiful ,and enigmatical insect, commonly named the Portugues man-of-war. It is from memoir by DOctar Tilesias, who accompanied M. de Krusenster, in his voyage around the world. \"This singular animal had for several times been delineated, described, and endOw ed with names, yet not only its denOmina- tions were various, but also the nature and characteristic ascribed to it. According to some it was Polypus, according to others a ZoOphyte. and others ranged it among the Mollusca.-Naturalists who followed in the steps of Lime have called it the PhysGLis' Wonderful as is all the works of Providence, | admirably fitted as are the several parts of each created being for their several functions, complex in composition as they somtiemes at first seem, while yet they are always found l to be really so simple and suitable in their action, on a nearer investigation. we may nevertheless, venture to rank this little animat- ed creature among the most curious phenOm- ena of nature. A worm between and inches in length, which is found but in certain attitudes, has seemingly the skill and know ledge of an experienced navigator, and IS in | itself little ship. Its evolutions are accord ing to the winds; it raises and lowers its sail which is membrane provided with eleyating | and depressing organs. When filled with aiI it is so light, that it swims on the surface o alcohol, and is at the same time provided with structure, which furnishes it the neces- Sary ballast.\n\n When high winds would endanger its ex. istance, it descends into the deep. and is nev' CT seen on the surface of the water.

Her wealth and charms attrac- ted crowds of knightly wOOers to her fathers castle; but the maiden, like another Camilla was entirely devoted to the bOsterOus exer- cises of the chase, in which she excelled many of her suitors she would hear no tale OflOve and dreaded marriage as she did prison. At length to free herself from all importunities, she made a solemn vow, never to give her hand but to the knight who would ride round the castle on the outer wall. Now, this wall is not only too narrow to furnish secure or pleasing promenade in many circumstances, but,throughOut nearly its whole course, it runs along the very brink of hideOus ,precipices, & in one place, hangs over the brink of a fright full abyss, which to this day, bears the name of Hell. The number of theslady's lovers rap idly diminished. The more prudent wisely considered, that the prize was not worth the rlsk; the vain proposed themselves to the tri- al,ln the hope that their presence would mol ify Cunigunda's heart and procure dispen- sation from the hard condition; but the mountain-beauty was proof against all arts, and when the moment of danger came, the courage of the suitor generally gave way. History has not recorded the precise number of those who actually made the attempt; it is only certain that every one of them broke his neck (as he well deserveda) and she lived on in her wild and virgin independence. At length young and handsome knight appear ed at the castle gate, and requested to be ad- mitted to the preseuce ofits mistress, that he might try his fortune. Cunigunda received him and her hour was come his manly beau ty, the courtesy ofhis behaviour, and his mo- ble spirit made her repent, for the first time, of the price which she had set upon her hand. Having received in presence of the in- mates of the castle her promlse to become his bride fine should return in safety from the trial, I,he rode forth to the wall, accompanied by the tears and wishes ofthe repentant beau- ty. In a short time shout from the menials announced that the adventu.e had been a. chieved and Cunigunda exulting that she was conquered hastened into the court, which the triumphant knight was just entering, to meet his ardent caresses.-Bat the knight stood aloof, gloomy and severe. \"I can claim you,\" said he; \"but am come, and have risked my life, not to win your hand but to humble your pride, ,and to punish your bar barity''-and tEereupOn he read her harsh lecture on the cruelty and arrogance of her conduct towards her suit0rs. The spirit of chivalry weeps at recording, that he finished his oration in giving the astonished beauty a box on the ear, sprung into his saddle, and galloped forth from the gate. It was the Landgrave Albert of Thuringia, already a married man, and who had long trained his favorite steed to this perilous exercise. The memory of the ulterior fate of Cunigunda has not survived.",

He was the son of very poor man, and at the age of thirteen was bound an apprentice to a respectable mechanic in neighbOuring village. He was active and ingenious. He was faithful to his work, and consequently found many leisure hours for sporting with other boys of the village. Several months passed away and Harry seemed to enjoy this tune extremely well. He, however, would sometimes mediate very seriously on the manner in which he had spent his leisure time.\n\n One night after he had gone to bed he lay awake for an hour or two. He said to himself, \"What good will all this play do me ? shall by and by be man, and then shall know but little more than barely to work my usual hours and then play like boy.' After many such firm reflections he fell asleep. He awoke the next morning with the thoughts fresh on his mind and rose with the determination to devote but half as much time as usual to sport and the rest of his spare time he would spend in reading books, if he could find any one who would lend him. He finished his regular portion of work for that day long before surdown. He then went to Esq. Tisdale, (whO was very good man) and asked him if he would lend him some books to read.-Esq. T. looked at him a moment with little surprise. yet with smile on his face. \"And why do you wish books to read ?\" said he. Because\" said HaTy, II have several hours spare time, du- ring the week, which usually spend with my pIayfellows; but was thinking last night, it would be great deal better for ne to spend part of the time in reading some books, that will do me good when become a man. have no money to buy them, and if you, Sir will he good enough to lend me one to begin with, will use it very carefully ,and be much obliged to you.\n\n The good man was always delighted with an opportunity of doing good; and the honest simplicity of the boy in making this applica- ton heightened his pleasure in granting the request. He not only lent him an interesting little volume for that week, but promised him the use of any books he might wish to read.\n\n Harry went home with this precious treas ure and began to read. He became so well pleased with the book, that he spent very lit- tie time in the company of his mates. He re- turned the volume and took another. .and sev- eral weeks passed in similar manner. They could not but miss him, as he had been the must active among them. After learning the reason ofthis absence, they began to laugh at him and asked him If he was going to turn Methodist? Harry had naturally proud heart, and was not altogether pleased with their ridicule. One night he considered a long time, after he had went to bed, doubtful whether he should keep to his favorite pursuit of reading, or yield to the entreaties of his friends, and spend all his spare time in play. He fell asleep without coming to any conclu- sion. The next morning he awoke, and thought of the subject few minutes before he arose. It took him but short time to decide. He bounced out of bed-snapped his fingers as sign ofhs resolution. :. Whats all their nonsense to me ?\" said he, they may call me Methodist ifthey please will get my knowledge in spite of them. Ihey may have their play and I'll have my book so good bye to ye, my lads, I'll not go with you at all now.' He quit their company, and month after month, and year after year, he pursued a course ofreading which stored his mind with the most valuable information. Esq. T. sought many occasions of conversing with him about what he had read and open ed his mind to that all important subject which relates to the immortality of the soul, and of the only way to escape eternal punish ment. He lent him religious books. The effort was not lost. The Holy Spirit accom- panied proper means, and Harry became a penitent believer in the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n Youthful reader, would you like to know what has become of Harry? He is now one ofthe most respectable men in our country. His knowledge is extensive,an his society is sought and esteemed by all good men. By his industry he has acquired competent for tune. He has enough to support his family, and to supply the wants ofthe poor and affiic- ted around him. He is, indeed, a happy man h,ncause his house is the house of prayer ---h,, loves the bible and his God, and is constantly looking forward to the day of his death, as to day that will introduce him to the glories of the heavenly world, where are the saints and angels of the Lord, and where his Jesus dwells to receive all those who love and serve him,into mansions of ev- erlasting happiness.\n\n CUNIGUNDA AND HER LOVERS.

            "article": "|\" In this work the most important part is to give them better religion. Knowing how strongly feel on this subject, you will not be surprised at my placing it foremost. But even if Christianity were out of the question, and if, when had wheeled away the rubbish of the old Pagodas, had nothing bt tier than simple deism to erect in their stead, should still feel some of the anxiety which now ur- ges me. It is necessary to see idoatry, to be fully sensible of its mischievous effects on the human mind. But of all idolatres which I have ever read or heard of, the religion of the Hindoos, in which have taken some pains to inform myself, really appears to me the worst, both in the degrading notions which it gives ofthe Deity in the endless rounds of it's burdensome ceremonies, which occupy the time and distract the thoughts, without either instructing or interesting it's votaries in the filthy acts of uncleanness and cruelty not on- ly permitted but enjoined, and inseparably in- terwoven with those ceremonies in the sys- than any thing else the devil has invented, to destroy the feelings of general benevolence, and to make nine-tenths of mankind the hopeless slaves of the remainder: and in to- tai absence of any system of morals, or any SiuSlc ltSSOH, WHICH Lllc peOple al IafGe ever hear, to live virtuOusly and to do good to each other. do not say, indeed that there are not some scattered lessons of this kind to be- found in their ancient books; but those books are neither accessible to the people at large, nor are these last permitted to read them: and, in general, all the sins which a Sudra is taught to fear, are, killing a COW, offending Brahmin,or neglecting one of the many frivolous rights by which their deities are supposed to be concilated. Accordingly though the general sobriety of the Hindoos, Ia virtue which they possess, in common with most inhabitants of warm clmates) affords a very great facility to the maintenance ofpub- lie order and decorum, realIys have never met with race of men whose standard ol morality is so low, who feel so little apparent shame in being detected in a afaIshood, or so little interest in the sufferings of neighbour not being of their own cast or family whose ordinary and familiar conversation is SO licen. tious or, in the wilder and more lawless districts, who shed blood with so little re. Dugnance.\"",

            "article": "A curious circumstance in Natural History is related in the last number of the American Quarterly Review. The large winged grass hopper, which flutters with SO much vivacity through our meadows during the autumn, feeds upon vegitable matter, and deposits its eggs upon vegitables for the purpose of being supported until matured. Before the grass hopper takes wing, another insect, the ichneu- mon, alights upon its body,and rhrusts under it's skin a number of eggs, by means of tu- bula, awl shaped oviduct.-These eggs slow ly acquire perfection, become living worms, and feed upon the body of the hapless grass hopper, until themselves are ready to take wlng. So admirably do they perform their office, ,that they do not injure the vital organs of the insect they are internally devouring, until they are just ready to change their state; and at the proper season, hundreds of grasshoppers, in this condition, have just strength enough to futter to a tree or fence, and with a dying effort fix their hooked feet so firmly as to retain that position long after death. Examine their bodies at this season, and you will find an empty shell, or one filled with large and active worms, just ready to burst their coverings and become winged insects.\n\n The recently published number of the North American Review supplies us with a. nOther description of natural object, but lit- tie known, to common readers, though said to be familiar to the sight of those who navi- gate between the trophics-the beautiful ,and enigmatical insect, commonly named the Portugues man-of-war. It is from memoir by DOctar Tilesias, who accompanied M. de Krusenster, in his voyage around the world. \"This singular animal had for several times been delineated, described, and endOw ed with names, yet not only its denOmina- tions were various, but also the nature and characteristic ascribed to it. According to some it was Polypus, according to others a ZoOphyte. and others ranged it among the Mollusca.-Naturalists who followed in the steps of Lime have called it the PhysGLis' Wonderful as is all the works of Providence, | admirably fitted as are the several parts of each created being for their several functions, complex in composition as they somtiemes at first seem, while yet they are always found l to be really so simple and suitable in their action, on a nearer investigation. we may nevertheless, venture to rank this little animat- ed creature among the most curious phenOm- ena of nature. A worm between and inches in length, which is found but in certain attitudes, has seemingly the skill and know ledge of an experienced navigator, and IS in | itself little ship. Its evolutions are accord ing to the winds; it raises and lowers its sail which is membrane provided with eleyating | and depressing organs. When filled with aiI it is so light, that it swims on the surface o alcohol, and is at the same time provided with structure, which furnishes it the neces- Sary ballast.\n\n When high winds would endanger its ex. istance, it descends into the deep. and is nev' CT seen on the surface of the water.

At length to free herself from all importunities, she made a solemn vow, never to give her hand but to the knight who would ride round the castle on the outer wall. Now, this wall is not only too narrow to furnish secure or pleasing promenade in many circumstances, but,throughOut nearly its whole course, it runs along the very brink of hideOus ,precipices, & in one place, hangs over the brink of a fright full abyss, which to this day, bears the name of Hell. The number of theslady's lovers rap idly diminished. The more prudent wisely considered, that the prize was not worth the rlsk; the vain proposed themselves to the tri- al,ln the hope that their presence would mol ify Cunigunda's heart and procure dispen- sation from the hard condition; but the mountain-beauty was proof against all arts, and when the moment of danger came, the courage of the suitor generally gave way. History has not recorded the precise number of those who actually made the attempt; it is only certain that every one of them broke his neck (as he well deserveda) and she lived on in her wild and virgin independence. At length young and handsome knight appear ed at the castle gate, and requested to be ad- mitted to the preseuce ofits mistress, that he might try his fortune. Cunigunda received him and her hour was come his manly beau ty, the courtesy ofhis behaviour, and his mo- ble spirit made her repent, for the first time, of the price which she had set upon her hand. Having received in presence of the in- mates of the castle her promlse to become his bride fine should return in safety from the trial, I,he rode forth to the wall, accompanied by the tears and wishes ofthe repentant beau- ty. In a short time shout from the menials announced that the adventu.e had been a. chieved and Cunigunda exulting that she was conquered hastened into the court, which the triumphant knight was just entering, to meet his ardent caresses.-Bat the knight stood aloof, gloomy and severe. \"I can claim you,\" said he; \"but am come, and have risked my life, not to win your hand but to humble your pride, ,and to punish your bar barity''-and tEereupOn he read her harsh lecture on the cruelty and arrogance of her conduct towards her suit0rs. The spirit of chivalry weeps at recording, that he finished his oration in giving the astonished beauty a box on the ear, sprung into his saddle, and galloped forth from the gate. It was the Landgrave Albert of Thuringia, already a married man, and who had long trained his favorite steed to this perilous exercise. The memory of the ulterior fate of Cunigunda has not survived.",

            "article": "From the JWuerHe Maguzine.\n\n HARRY THE APPRENTICE.\n\n Twenty years ago knew Henry Mandin. He was the son of very poor man, and at the age of thirteen was bound an apprentice to a respectable mechanic in neighbOuring village. He was active and ingenious. He was faithful to his work, and consequently found many leisure hours for sporting with other boys of the village. Several months passed away and Harry seemed to enjoy this tune extremely well. He, however, would sometimes mediate very seriously on the manner in which he had spent his leisure time.\n\n One night after he had gone to bed he lay awake for an hour or two. He said to himself, \"What good will all this play do me ? shall by and by be man, and then shall know but little more than barely to work my usual hours and then play like boy.' After many such firm reflections he fell asleep. He awoke the next morning with the thoughts fresh on his mind and rose with the determination to devote but half as much time as usual to sport and the rest of his spare time he would spend in reading books, if he could find any one who would lend him. He finished his regular portion of work for that day long before surdown. He then went to Esq. Tisdale, (whO was very good man) and asked him if he would lend him some books to read.-Esq. T. looked at him a moment with little surprise. yet with smile on his face. \"And why do you wish books to read ?\" said he. Because\" said HaTy, II have several hours spare time, du- ring the week, which usually spend with my pIayfellows; but was thinking last night, it would be great deal better for ne to spend part of the time in reading some books, that will do me good when become a man. have no money to buy them, and if you, Sir will he good enough to lend me one to begin with, will use it very carefully ,and be much obliged to you.\n\n The good man was always delighted with an opportunity of doing good; and the honest simplicity of the boy in making this applica- ton heightened his pleasure in granting the request. He not only lent him an interesting little volume for that week, but promised him the use of any books he might wish to read.\n\n Harry went home with this precious treas ure and began to read. He became so well pleased with the book, that he spent very lit- tie time in the company of his mates. He re- turned the volume and took another. .and sev- eral weeks passed in similar manner. They could not but miss him, as he had been the must active among them. After learning the reason ofthis absence, they began to laugh at him and asked him If he was going to turn Methodist? Harry had naturally proud heart, and was not altogether pleased with their ridicule. One night he considered a long time, after he had went to bed, doubtful whether he should keep to his favorite pursuit of reading, or yield to the entreaties of his friends, and spend all his spare time in play. He fell asleep without coming to any conclu- sion. The next morning he awoke, and thought of the subject few minutes before he arose. It took him but short time to decide. He bounced out of bed-snapped his fingers as sign ofhs resolution. :. Whats all their nonsense to me ?\" said he, they may call me Methodist ifthey please will get my knowledge in spite of them. Ihey may have their play and I'll have my book so good bye to ye, my lads, I'll not go with you at all now.' He quit their company, and month after month, and year after year, he pursued a course ofreading which stored his mind with the most valuable information. Esq. T. sought many occasions of conversing with him about what he had read and open ed his mind to that all important subject which relates to the immortality of the soul, and of the only way to escape eternal punish ment. He lent him religious books. The effort was not lost. The Holy Spirit accom- panied proper means, and Harry became a penitent believer in the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n Youthful reader, would you like to know what has become of Harry? He is now one ofthe most respectable men in our country. His knowledge is extensive,an his society is sought and esteemed by all good men. By his industry he has acquired competent for tune. He has enough to support his family, and to supply the wants ofthe poor and affiic- ted around him. He is, indeed, a happy man h,ncause his house is the house of prayer ---h,, loves the bible and his God, and is constantly looking forward to the day of his death, as to day that will introduce him to the glories of the heavenly world, where are the saints and angels of the Lord, and where his Jesus dwells to receive all those who love and serve him,into mansions of ev- erlasting happiness.\n\n CUNIGUNDA AND HER LOVERS.
