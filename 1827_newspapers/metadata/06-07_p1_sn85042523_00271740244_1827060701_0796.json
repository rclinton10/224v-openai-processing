            "raw_text": "soon on the alert. In some degree enyied them\nthe comfortable sleep they had experienced -\nsuch pleasure wasaened to me by the constant\nnausea which had not left me during the night.\nme thermometer marked two degrees Reaumur\nbelow zero; and how much lower it had been I\ncoliid not ascertain, not having one of Cavallo's\nhorizontal thermometers, which indicate in the\nmorning the extreme cold during the night. It\nIS, however, general opinion, that at the breah\nof day, and Just before the sun rises the coId !.\nat the greatest, and do not think the thermorn-\nctcr has been much lower.\n\n\nA good fire was soon blazing in one corner\nOF our ormitory; snow was melted, some me-\ngus made, and two or three cold fowl, soon dis\nappeared; was thirsty, but my appetite was\ngone.\n\n\nAs soon as breakfast was finished, we made\npreparations for our second DAYS march; and\nhaving determined, if we possibly could, to sleep\nat the same place the second night, we left great\npart OF our baggage, taking with us provisions\ntor midday meal, and two or three bottles O\nvine; our shoes and stockings were hung up to\ndry IN the sun, there being no fear, as Coutet\nobserved, hat they would be stolen by any pass.\ncrsby. Towards five O'Clock, we were all in\nreadiness, the ropes were again affixed to us as\nyesterday, and we started forth, linked together\nlike criminals to be tried for life or death. Cou.\ntet gave us paper of raisns and figs, which he\nsaid would be very acceptable to MUNICH occa-\nsonally with handful of snow. On descending\nfrom Les Grands Mulets, we passed by the ruins\not the small hut which Monsieur de Saussurc had\nerected during his visit to Mont blanc in 1887.\nIt was good deal encumbered with snow, and\nthe walls did not appear more than two or three\nfeet high. lprcferred the spot we had chosen\nfor our nights lodging, as the views were more\nextensive.\n\n\nAlters cursory review of the remains of the hut\nwhich the iudefatipahlS Gam b,l\npied, we almost immediately found ourselves on\nthe Glacier dc Iacconai. Our guides felt very\n! san8lnne as to the weather. The sky was clear,\nand the morning cold, although the sun had al.\nready influenced our thermometer before we left\nthe Grands Mulets; for between four and five\no'clock 1t had risen one degree, and was thus\ny one degree below sero when we commenced\nour second days journey.\n\n\nThe Glacier dc facconai s not so difficult to\ntraverse as the one we had encountered yestere\nday, but should say it was more replete with\nbeauties ofits own kind. 1t would be endless\nto detail toyou our progress over the crcvices\nour descent INTO them, and the difficulties of O.\nvercoming the irregularities on the ice. These\n! glaciers, as well as others among the Alps, are\nsupposed to be in many places five hundred OF\nSIX hundred feet thick Where the inclination\notthe rock on which they are formed, makes an\nangle OF thirty or forty degrees, their descent\nmust be supposed to be somewhat rapid towards\nthe valleys, although their movements is of course\nimperceptiblc TO the eye. Passing, as they do,\nover very rugged foundation, parts of them are\nimpeded, while other parts arc proceeding; and\nhence arise the crevices or cracks, some ofwhch\n! | have seen not wider than half an inch, appara\n/ emily just made, while others were much too\nlarge for us TO pass over. Once we made bridge\nby laying four or five of our poles in Horizontal\ni position, close together, where the chasm uss\nnot very wide, but of unknown depth. The ice\nof the glaciers has different appearance from\n! that which we see on ponds or lakes. in no case\ncould skates be used: the ice is porous and\nscarcely ever can you find piece exempt from\nlnntmcrable air bubbles, except in icices, the\nformation OF which arc evidently different. We\nwere obliged frequently to cut ladders or steps\nin the rapid ascents or walls of ice; and think\nit Was seldom so hlrd as the common ice in our\nvalleys, the globulcs of air naturally rendering it\nless compact. The ice in these lofty regions is\nplainly formed in . different manner from all 0.\nthcr ice. There IS constant, though gentle,\ntliaw, III the day, and this humidity freezes every\nnight; thus an ice is produced Which might be\nsaid to be composed Of an endless succession Of\nstrata, and the midday thaw not being sufficient\nTO dissolve all the snow, the air consequently is\nnot driven out; hence the innumerable instersti-\nces. II is well KNOWN and easily understood,\n\n\nthat whenever it rains in the valleys, it SHOWS oil\n\n\n,hesc mountains; so that, in fact, it never rains\n\n\non the summit of the Alps.\n\n\nThese glaciers are constantly fed, not only by\nthe SHOWS, but by u thousand smaller glaciers,\n\n\nwhich descend from the peaks through the rs-\n\n\nvines, to aid the growth of the greater. On ma.\nny sides of these perpendicular aiguilles, the\n\n\nsnow finds no place to lodge, as is very evident\n\n\non that face of Mont Blanc next to the Alice Bian.\n\n\nche; consequently in long and heavy snow\n\n\nstorms, the accumulation on the glaciers, which\n\n\nbecome the rese# oir, is double what it would\n\n\nbe, if tho surrounding country was plain*.\n\n\nWe continued our journey across the Glacier\n\n\ndc Tacconai, in . direction leading towards the\n\n\nDome de Goutc. In about two hours We en-.\ncountered fresh difficulties, such as we had not\nexperienced before from the fresil,fallcn SHOWS.\nnot more than three or four days old the sur\nface frozen of the thickness of shilling, but\nnot sufficiently TO bear our weight consequent\ny the fatigue of walking became very great, as\nwe had lost all solid footing. This fresh snow\nretarded our progress very much, for the guides\nwere obliged to advance considerable disiauc>\nbefore MS i'll order to ascertain the most prscti.\ncable Path the crevices being partly obscure!,\nthe danger Of passing them was very much in\ncreased We frequently halted some minutes\nfor their return, and, if their report was mfu'\nvonrble, we changed our direction and pursue ]\nanother The anxiety and perseverance of the\nguides We're beyond all praise, and could only be\n\\ equaed by degree Of calmness and prudence\n\n\nrarely met with in such hardy fellows.",

The sky was clear,\nand the morning cold, although the sun had al.\nready influenced our thermometer before we left\nthe Grands Mulets; for between four and five\no'clock 1t had risen one degree, and was thus\ny one degree below sero when we commenced\nour second days journey.\n\n\nThe Glacier dc facconai s not so difficult to\ntraverse as the one we had encountered yestere\nday, but should say it was more replete with\nbeauties ofits own kind. 1t would be endless\nto detail toyou our progress over the crcvices\nour descent INTO them, and the difficulties of O.\nvercoming the irregularities on the ice. These\n! glaciers, as well as others among the Alps, are\nsupposed to be in many places five hundred OF\nSIX hundred feet thick Where the inclination\notthe rock on which they are formed, makes an\nangle OF thirty or forty degrees, their descent\nmust be supposed to be somewhat rapid towards\nthe valleys, although their movements is of course\nimperceptiblc TO the eye. Passing, as they do,\nover very rugged foundation, parts of them are\nimpeded, while other parts arc proceeding; and\nhence arise the crevices or cracks, some ofwhch\n! | have seen not wider than half an inch, appara\n/ emily just made, while others were much too\nlarge for us TO pass over. Once we made bridge\nby laying four or five of our poles in Horizontal\ni position, close together, where the chasm uss\nnot very wide, but of unknown depth. The ice\nof the glaciers has different appearance from\n! that which we see on ponds or lakes. in no case\ncould skates be used: the ice is porous and\nscarcely ever can you find piece exempt from\nlnntmcrable air bubbles, except in icices, the\nformation OF which arc evidently different. We\nwere obliged frequently to cut ladders or steps\nin the rapid ascents or walls of ice; and think\nit Was seldom so hlrd as the common ice in our\nvalleys, the globulcs of air naturally rendering it\nless compact. The ice in these lofty regions is\nplainly formed in . different manner from all 0.\nthcr ice. There IS constant, though gentle,\ntliaw, III the day, and this humidity freezes every\nnight; thus an ice is produced Which might be\nsaid to be composed Of an endless succession Of\nstrata, and the midday thaw not being sufficient\nTO dissolve all the snow, the air consequently is\nnot driven out; hence the innumerable instersti-\nces. II is well KNOWN and easily understood,\n\n\nthat whenever it rains in the valleys, it SHOWS oil\n\n\n,hesc mountains; so that, in fact, it never rains\n\n\non the summit of the Alps.\n\n\nThese glaciers are constantly fed, not only by\nthe SHOWS, but by u thousand smaller glaciers,\n\n\nwhich descend from the peaks through the rs-\n\n\nvines, to aid the growth of the greater. On ma.\nny sides of these perpendicular aiguilles, the\n\n\nsnow finds no place to lodge, as is very evident\n\n\non that face of Mont Blanc next to the Alice Bian.\n\n\nche; consequently in long and heavy snow\n\n\nstorms, the accumulation on the glaciers, which\n\n\nbecome the rese# oir, is double what it would\n\n\nbe, if tho surrounding country was plain*.\n\n\nWe continued our journey across the Glacier\n\n\ndc Tacconai, in . direction leading towards the\n\n\nDome de Goutc. In about two hours We en-.\ncountered fresh difficulties, such as we had not\nexperienced before from the fresil,fallcn SHOWS.\nnot more than three or four days old the sur\nface frozen of the thickness of shilling, but\nnot sufficiently TO bear our weight consequent\ny the fatigue of walking became very great, as\nwe had lost all solid footing. This fresh snow\nretarded our progress very much, for the guides\nwere obliged to advance considerable disiauc>\nbefore MS i'll order to ascertain the most prscti.\ncable Path the crevices being partly obscure!,\nthe danger Of passing them was very much in\ncreased We frequently halted some minutes\nfor their return, and, if their report was mfu'\nvonrble, we changed our direction and pursue ]\nanother The anxiety and perseverance of the\nguides We're beyond all praise, and could only be\n\\ equaed by degree Of calmness and prudence\n\n\nrarely met with in such hardy fellows.",
