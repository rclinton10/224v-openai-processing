The uniformity and certainty of the Law, contributes to the con- venience and safety of the people, prevent litigation and promote the peace of the com munity. Alterations of that code therefore ought not to be made without the most de- liberate consideration.\n\n In discharging the duties enjoined on the Executive by the Constitut on, of giving to the General Assembly information of the state of the Government, and recommending to their consideration such measures as he may deem expedient, the attention is naturally drawn to the instrument prescribing it.\n\n Notwithstanding the constitution was strong ly opposed in its reception, and the necessity of its rejection earnestly urged, when 1t was submitted to the immediate consideration of the people, for their appreciation, it will now, it is presumed, be generally admitted that 1t has, not only better defined our civil and reli- gious rights, but more effectually secured those rights, by establishing and perpetuating the republican principles transmitted to us from our ancestors. But being the production of human councils, in which diversity Ofviews, not unfrequently renders necessary compro- mise and yielding of opinions, its framers an- ticipated that experience might prove it to be like all other instt utons Of man, in some re- speets, imperfect among the powers delegated by the constitution, is that of proposing to alter or amend it. This is an important power, and in its exercise, great caution shouldb be observed. A change of the supreme law of d state should not be made ex- cept for the most weighty reasons.\n\n On the stability of that law in great degree depends it's utility. Propositions of a mere speculative character, tending to produce ex- ctement in the public mind, ought to be dis cOuntenanccd.\n\n The power to propose alterations of the fundamental law of the State, is committed exclusively to the House of Representatives.\n\n TO the mode of electing Senators prescri- bed by the constitution, objections were ur- ged before its ratification, which, being con- tinued, and having considerably agitated the public mind, are entitled to deliberate, careful and dispassiOnate consideration.\n\n In approaching this subject, involved as it unquestionably is, in real difficulties resulting from the civil divisions and long established usages of the state, the most solicitous and faithful respect and regard, should be paid to the rights and liberties of the people, who are the only legitimate source of political power, and for whose benefit civil governments are instituted, and ought invariably to be adminis- tered. >.\n\n It has been objected that in voting for the entire senate, according to the provisions of the constitution, the Electors, in order to se- cure an equal apportionment of the members of that body, among the several counties in the state, are often obliged to act with an inn perfect knowledge of the talents, qualifications and characters of some of the persons to whom they entrust the exercise of the high authority and important powers delegated to 1 that body, and are exposed 10 be deceived by misrepresentation; that the value and power ofthe right of suffrage are thereby diminished; that the difficulty of exercising the elective franchise correctly and satisfactorily to the conscience of the electors, may lead to its dis use, and that the fundamental principles of government, ,are thus infringed, and our republican institutions endanger. These objections to the constitutional mode of electing senators, are entitled to grave con- sideration. Whether any or all the evils alled- ged have in fact been produced by the provis- ions of the constitution in relation to the cleo tion of senators, the House to whom the sub ject is delegated, will judge. The admission that such results have arisen, from the exis- ting mode of electing the senate, would prove the constitution in this particular defective, & form powerful reason for it's amendment, & a departure from system long established. The evils complained of may be to consid- erable extent prevented by an amendment of the constitution, which shall establish the numbers of which the senate shall consist, and provide that the General Assembly. by law, to be passed for that purpose. shall divide the State, as soon as may be, after the adoption of the amendment by the Electors, into such number of districts, for the purpose of felecting senators as may be deemed expedient that the districts so to be constituted, shall be com posed of contiguous territory. and that in each district there shall be chosen number of sen atOrs. bearing as nearly as may be practicable. the same proportion to the number of which the senate may consist. as the population of such district shall bear to the aggregate pop uiatlon of the State.

RUFUS KING.\n\n MT. King entered into public life at an early age.- After completing his legal stu- dies, he was chosen,a the close of the rev. olution 1784, to represent the state of Massachusetts in the old Continental Con- gross. In this body he acquired great in- fluence, and was the mover of a proposi- ton, which will always render his name distinguished and respected in the annals of his country. We refer to the prohibi- ton of slavery in the old North West Ter ritory. After serving in that body to the entire satisfaction of his constituents, he was deputed by the same State 10 the con- the United States. This instrument hav- ing been prepaired and submitted to the States for their ratification, MT. King Was sent, by the town of Newburyport, with MT. Parsons and Robert Treat Paine, to the State Convention, which gave the sanction of Massachusetts to the new con- sttuton. In procuring this sanction, MT. King was mainly instrumental. Objections were made in Massachusetts, as well as in New Y ork and Virginia {; and whilst the talents of Hamilton and Madison were engaged in surmoun;ing tho obstacles op- posed to it by the anti-federalist of the two latter States, MT. King was performing an act of equally vital importance to his coun- try, by soothing the fears and prejudices which operated againsts it, in State that was still agitated by the feelings which produced the Shay rebellion. When the requisite number of States had signifed their assent, and the constitution went in- to opperation under the auspicies of Wash ington, Mir. King was chosen by the Le- gislature of this State, their representative in the Senate of the United States, Here he acquired the particular confidence of Washington, by whom he was selected as the minister of this country to the Court of St. James. Although federalist, such was the confidence reposed in his talents and character by MT. Jefferson, that upon his succeeding Mir. Adams, he expressed his special desire to MT. King, that he should continue to represent the United States, at the British Court. In compli- ance with this request he continued until, having completed all the negotiations en- trusted to his care, in 1905 he requested permission to return to his native land, from which he had been absent about eight",

The income of the fund, it is believed, under the manage ment of the Commissioner, may, by its judi cous investment. be considerably augmented. The proper and faithful application of the in- terest of this fund fo the encouragement of education, will materially affect the character and happiness of all successive generations. The system of Common Schools established by our ancestors, widely dift,se the inteilectn- al attainments and moral principles, indispen- sable to the perpetuity of republican govern ment The division of the State into school societies and districts, affords peculiar facilities for extending the benefits of education, while the distribution ofthe interest of the School Fund, among the several school districts ac- cOrding to the number of persons in each, be- tween the ages of four and sixteen years, un' der the existing laws, secures to every youth ln the State, the priviledge of acquiring com mon education. fthe results of our system, improvedas it has been, by the lights of ex- perience, are not such as entirely to fulfil the anticipatiOns or it's founders, and the wishes of the phlanthropist, it is not perceived IS to\n\n be attributed as much to any radical defect in the system, as to remissness in its execution, on the part of those who have the immediate superintendeDce of the primary schools. Ev- cry effort should be made to impress upon their minds deep sense of the responsibility resting upon them, and of the blessings resuI- ting from literary and moral instruction.\n\n To elevate the character of our common schools, and to cause the utility to correspond with the munifcent means which are pledged for their support, instructors distinguished for learning. sobrety and virtue, must be employ ed, and the schools, as we'll as the instructors, subjected to a rigid examination and inspec- ton.\n\n The duties of the visitors of schools, as pre- scribed by law, are highly important; and on their faithful and thorough performance. the\n\n intellectual and moral improvement of our\n\n youth greatly depends. Your information\n\n and experience will enable you to determine,\n\n whether any further legal provision be neces- sary to insure such performance. The i'm proyement of system which has been admi- red and initiated in other States, is worthy of your deliberate and careful attention. To neg lect it would be contempt of those from W pOsterity.\n\n The emigration ofour citizens has arrested the progress of the population ofthls state, and diminished our political power in the Union. To retain our youthful, intelligent and enter prisng citizens within the State, their attach ment to theirnative soil, always strong, must be l by offering them combineda ad- which they will not easily find else where. They must see our colleges, and other seminaries of learning patronised; the public 1 burthens made equal and light; rigid econO- my practised in the various departments of the government justice speedily and impar- tially administered |: agriculture, manufac- lures, commerce and the arts encouraged and the condition of the State generally inn proved.\n\n ?

But the of woollen cloths needs encour- agement.\n\n The large importation of wool and wool len goods have injured both the grower and the manufacturer of wool and by depressing those interests, may reduce us to depen- dence on a foreign supply, for an article of prime necessity.\n\n These evils can only effectuay be removed by the National Government, in which is de- posted the power to le, duties Oh imports; and it is to be regretted, that a measure tho roughly matured for that purpose, and intend ed to protect and sustain the agricultural and | interests, after having been l passed by the immediate representatives of the people, was finally defeated in the other branch of Congress. Correct information, however, regarding the true interests and pol icy of our country, and steadiness of purpose, and an effort in maintaining them, may, at a future day, produce a different result.\n\n The object ofpunishment is to prevent the commission of crimes, either by destroying the power, or removing the disposition to | commit them.

No reason IS discovered why our State Prison, instead of occasiOning an annual expense of several thousand dollars, by an of it's police, may not be made source of actual profit to the state, while all the objects of punishment will be more effect. ualIy accomplished. This interesting and inn portant subject, occupied the deliberate at- tention of the General Assembly at the last session, and the erection of new State Pris- on was directed.\n\n The building of the ediice has been com under the direction of the cOmmis- sioners appointed to superintend it, whose re- port will be duly laid before you.-As the building will probably be completed before the termination of the current year, the expe- diency of establishing, during the present ses- sion, system for the regulation and govern ment of the prison, is presented to your con- sideration.\n\n To the National Government is committed the power to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia. Scarcely any difference of opinion has existed among the most enlightened and patriotic statesmen, as 10 the necessity of giving all possible efficien- cy to this powerful arm, of our defence; and this subject has recently attracted the special attention of the National Government. Du- ring the past year, Board of Officers was convened at Washington, to take into consid- eration the present organization of the militia system, and to propose such alterations as their skill and experience might enable them to suggest, and their judgment should ap- prove. Their report was laid before Con- gress, at its late session, but the principles it expressed were not made the sub ject of de- fnitye action. The report presents the ex- cess of the number of men which the law of Congress requires to be enrolled in the mill tia, as the primary defect of the system and proposes so to alter the existing law that no person shall be enrolled in the militia who shall not have arrived at the age of twenty one years: it being considered by the Board, tEat the public interest and safety in time of peace, do not require an enrolment in the mi Etia at an earlier age. The proposed exemp- ton would preserve the rightful control of masters, parents. and guardians, oyer their apprentices, wards, and children the due ex- ereise of which, is at all times important to the best interests of society. The opinion has also been expressed, by committee in one branch of Congress, in accordance with\n\n  cers, that it is expedient to exempt all persons above the age of thirty-fve years, from the performance of service in the militia. A mod |\n\n ication of the militia system, which should init the liability to enrolment in the militia, | o the period of life between the ages of l wenty-one and thirty five years, will consid- 'rably reduce the number of the militia, but | will increase its efficiency. It is not deem- d necessary to hold our citizeus enrolled for\n\n longer period, to accomplish any of the pur- 'oses for which the militia may be called into l ne service of the United States. The ne- essity which demanded the enrolment that vas required, when the population of the U. 'tates did not exceed four millions, no longer 1 xists, when their population is augmented | more than ten millions; and their mara me frontier will be defended by powerful ayy, and by formidable Notifications.\n\n No public exigency is discovered, which ow demands that masters shall be placed in le ranks with their apprentices, and that fla e trained by the side of their sons, or un- CT their command. The expeeliency ofshor- sning the period during which the citizens of lilitia, must be apparent, and it is hoped the 1easure will soon be adopted by the Nation Government.\n\n The states have reserved to themselves the of the officers, and the author y of training the militia, according to the discipline prescribed by Congress, and on the legislatures of the respective states, devolves he duty of passing laws to effect these ob- ects.\n\n The Militia of this state may be safely ! to be equal in organization, e. luipment, discipline, and efficiency, to the militia of any state in the Union.\n\n The exemption of such of our citizens as 'erform military service, and are armed, c. uipped, and dressed in uniform, according to aw. from the poll tax, has had a powerful endency to improve the militia, and has 'een followed by results demonstrative of the correctness of that policy. The reduction of he tax, by diminishing the induce,nent to a | complete equipment, and full compliance with the law, may impair the efficiency, and | cypress the spirit and ardor of the militia. It 5 therefore worthy of consideration, whether he burthens of that class in the community 1 'ught not to be diminished\n\n In my Judgment, frequent musters of the | militia, as they are generally, and perhaps ne- ,essariiy conducted, produce no considerable | advantage. They are Onerous to the militia, 1 'y calling them from their homes, and their employments occasion consid- erabie expense, and a loss of time, and un- | 1OubtedIy have Dernicious influence upon",

The uniformity and certainty of the Law, contributes to the con- venience and safety of the people, prevent litigation and promote the peace of the com munity. Alterations of that code therefore ought not to be made without the most de- liberate consideration.\n\n In discharging the duties enjoined on the Executive by the Constitut on, of giving to the General Assembly information of the state of the Government, and recommending to their consideration such measures as he may deem expedient, the attention is naturally drawn to the instrument prescribing it.\n\n Notwithstanding the constitution was strong ly opposed in its reception, and the necessity of its rejection earnestly urged, when 1t was submitted to the immediate consideration of the people, for their appreciation, it will now, it is presumed, be generally admitted that 1t has, not only better defined our civil and reli- gious rights, but more effectually secured those rights, by establishing and perpetuating the republican principles transmitted to us from our ancestors. But being the production of human councils, in which diversity Ofviews, not unfrequently renders necessary compro- mise and yielding of opinions, its framers an- ticipated that experience might prove it to be like all other instt utons Of man, in some re- speets, imperfect among the powers delegated by the constitution, is that of proposing to alter or amend it. This is an important power, and in its exercise, great caution shouldb be observed. A change of the supreme law of d state should not be made ex- cept for the most weighty reasons.\n\n On the stability of that law in great degree depends it's utility. Propositions of a mere speculative character, tending to produce ex- ctement in the public mind, ought to be dis cOuntenanccd.\n\n The power to propose alterations of the fundamental law of the State, is committed exclusively to the House of Representatives.\n\n TO the mode of electing Senators prescri- bed by the constitution, objections were ur- ged before its ratification, which, being con- tinued, and having considerably agitated the public mind, are entitled to deliberate, careful and dispassiOnate consideration.\n\n In approaching this subject, involved as it unquestionably is, in real difficulties resulting from the civil divisions and long established usages of the state, the most solicitous and faithful respect and regard, should be paid to the rights and liberties of the people, who are the only legitimate source of political power, and for whose benefit civil governments are instituted, and ought invariably to be adminis- tered. >.\n\n It has been objected that in voting for the entire senate, according to the provisions of the constitution, the Electors, in order to se- cure an equal apportionment of the members of that body, among the several counties in the state, are often obliged to act with an inn perfect knowledge of the talents, qualifications and characters of some of the persons to whom they entrust the exercise of the high authority and important powers delegated to 1 that body, and are exposed 10 be deceived by misrepresentation; that the value and power ofthe right of suffrage are thereby diminished; that the difficulty of exercising the elective franchise correctly and satisfactorily to the conscience of the electors, may lead to its dis use, and that the fundamental principles of government, ,are thus infringed, and our republican institutions endanger. These objections to the constitutional mode of electing senators, are entitled to grave con- sideration. Whether any or all the evils alled- ged have in fact been produced by the provis- ions of the constitution in relation to the cleo tion of senators, the House to whom the sub ject is delegated, will judge. The admission that such results have arisen, from the exis- ting mode of electing the senate, would prove the constitution in this particular defective, & form powerful reason for it's amendment, & a departure from system long established. The evils complained of may be to consid- erable extent prevented by an amendment of the constitution, which shall establish the numbers of which the senate shall consist, and provide that the General Assembly. by law, to be passed for that purpose. shall divide the State, as soon as may be, after the adoption of the amendment by the Electors, into such number of districts, for the purpose of felecting senators as may be deemed expedient that the districts so to be constituted, shall be com posed of contiguous territory. and that in each district there shall be chosen number of sen atOrs. bearing as nearly as may be practicable. the same proportion to the number of which the senate may consist. as the population of such district shall bear to the aggregate pop uiatlon of the State.

In this body he acquired great in- fluence, and was the mover of a proposi- ton, which will always render his name distinguished and respected in the annals of his country.

Parsons and Robert Treat Paine, to the State Convention, which gave the sanction of Massachusetts to the new con- sttuton. In procuring this sanction, MT. King was mainly instrumental. Objections were made in Massachusetts, as well as in New Y ork and Virginia {; and whilst the talents of Hamilton and Madison were engaged in surmoun;ing tho obstacles op- posed to it by the anti-federalist of the two latter States, MT. King was performing an act of equally vital importance to his coun- try, by soothing the fears and prejudices which operated againsts it, in State that was still agitated by the feelings which produced the Shay rebellion.

King was chosen by the Le- gislature of this State, their representative in the Senate of the United States, Here he acquired the particular confidence of Washington, by whom he was selected as the minister of this country to the Court of St. James.

King, that he should continue to represent the United States, at the British Court.

Ev- cry effort should be made to impress upon their minds deep sense of the responsibility resting upon them, and of the blessings resuI- ting from literary and moral instruction.\n\n To elevate the character of our common schools, and to cause the utility to correspond with the munifcent means which are pledged for their support, instructors distinguished for learning. sobrety and virtue, must be employ ed, and the schools, as we'll as the instructors, subjected to a rigid examination and inspec- ton.\n\n The duties of the visitors of schools, as pre- scribed by law, are highly important; and on their faithful and thorough performance. the\n\n intellectual and moral improvement of our\n\n youth greatly depends. Your information\n\n and experience will enable you to determine,\n\n whether any further legal provision be neces- sary to insure such performance. The i'm proyement of system which has been admi- red and initiated in other States, is worthy of your deliberate and careful attention. To neg lect it would be contempt of those from W pOsterity.\n\n The emigration ofour citizens has arrested the progress of the population ofthls state, and diminished our political power in the Union. To retain our youthful, intelligent and enter prisng citizens within the State, their attach ment to theirnative soil, always strong, must be l by offering them combineda ad- which they will not easily find else where. They must see our colleges, and other seminaries of learning patronised; the public 1 burthens made equal and light; rigid econO- my practised in the various departments of the government justice speedily and impar- tially administered |: agriculture, manufac- lures, commerce and the arts encouraged and the condition of the State generally inn proved.\n\n ? Our large manufacturing establishments, and the various mechanic arts, by furnishing lucrative employmen have kept in the state many valuable citizens and stimulated agri- culture, navigation, and commerce. But the of woollen cloths needs encour- agement.\n\n The large importation of wool and wool len goods have injured both the grower and the manufacturer of wool and by depressing those interests, may reduce us to depen- dence on a foreign supply, for an article of prime necessity.\n\n These evils can only effectuay be removed by the National Government, in which is de- posted the power to le, duties Oh imports; and it is to be regretted, that a measure tho roughly matured for that purpose, and intend ed to protect and sustain the agricultural and | interests, after having been l passed by the immediate representatives of the people, was finally defeated in the other branch of Congress. Correct information, however, regarding the true interests and pol icy of our country, and steadiness of purpose, and an effort in maintaining them, may, at a future day, produce a different result.\n\n The object ofpunishment is to prevent the commission of crimes, either by destroying the power, or removing the disposition to | commit them. The former can only be ac- complshed by capital punishment, or the per- petual seclusion of the criminal from society 1; l and the latter, by his reformation. ~ In effecting the reformation of the criminal, | Ian object of high moment, and uniformly sought by the benevolent and good, his con 6nement to hard labour, with strict silence, while engaged in work, and absolute seclusion from the society of man. in solitary cells, du- ring the hours ofrest, has powerful influence.

No reason IS discovered why our State Prison, instead of occasiOning an annual expense of several thousand dollars, by an of it's police, may not be made source of actual profit to the state, while all the objects of punishment will be more effect. ualIy accomplished. This interesting and inn portant subject, occupied the deliberate at- tention of the General Assembly at the last session, and the erection of new State Pris- on was directed.\n\n The building of the ediice has been com under the direction of the cOmmis- sioners appointed to superintend it, whose re- port will be duly laid before you.-As the building will probably be completed before the termination of the current year, the expe- diency of establishing, during the present ses- sion, system for the regulation and govern ment of the prison, is presented to your con- sideration.\n\n To the National Government is committed the power to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia. Scarcely any difference of opinion has existed among the most enlightened and patriotic statesmen, as 10 the necessity of giving all possible efficien- cy to this powerful arm, of our defence; and this subject has recently attracted the special attention of the National Government. Du- ring the past year, Board of Officers was convened at Washington, to take into consid- eration the present organization of the militia system, and to propose such alterations as their skill and experience might enable them to suggest, and their judgment should ap- prove. Their report was laid before Con- gress, at its late session, but the principles it expressed were not made the sub ject of de- fnitye action. The report presents the ex- cess of the number of men which the law of Congress requires to be enrolled in the mill tia, as the primary defect of the system and proposes so to alter the existing law that no person shall be enrolled in the militia who shall not have arrived at the age of twenty one years: it being considered by the Board, tEat the public interest and safety in time of peace, do not require an enrolment in the mi Etia at an earlier age. The proposed exemp- ton would preserve the rightful control of masters, parents. and guardians, oyer their apprentices, wards, and children the due ex- ereise of which, is at all times important to the best interests of society. The opinion has also been expressed, by committee in one branch of Congress, in accordance with\n\n  cers, that it is expedient to exempt all persons above the age of thirty-fve years, from the performance of service in the militia. A mod |\n\n ication of the militia system, which should init the liability to enrolment in the militia, | o the period of life between the ages of l wenty-one and thirty five years, will consid- 'rably reduce the number of the militia, but | will increase its efficiency. It is not deem- d necessary to hold our citizeus enrolled for\n\n longer period, to accomplish any of the pur- 'oses for which the militia may be called into l ne service of the United States. The ne- essity which demanded the enrolment that vas required, when the population of the U. 'tates did not exceed four millions, no longer 1 xists, when their population is augmented | more than ten millions; and their mara me frontier will be defended by powerful ayy, and by formidable Notifications.\n\n No public exigency is discovered, which ow demands that masters shall be placed in le ranks with their apprentices, and that fla e trained by the side of their sons, or un- CT their command. The expeeliency ofshor- sning the period during which the citizens of lilitia, must be apparent, and it is hoped the 1easure will soon be adopted by the Nation Government.\n\n The states have reserved to themselves the of the officers, and the author y of training the militia, according to the discipline prescribed by Congress, and on the legislatures of the respective states, devolves he duty of passing laws to effect these ob- ects.\n\n The Militia of this state may be safely ! to be equal in organization, e. luipment, discipline, and efficiency, to the militia of any state in the Union.\n\n The exemption of such of our citizens as 'erform military service, and are armed, c. uipped, and dressed in uniform, according to aw. from the poll tax, has had a powerful endency to improve the militia, and has 'een followed by results demonstrative of the correctness of that policy. The reduction of he tax, by diminishing the induce,nent to a | complete equipment, and full compliance with the law, may impair the efficiency, and | cypress the spirit and ardor of the militia. It 5 therefore worthy of consideration, whether he burthens of that class in the community 1 'ught not to be diminished\n\n In my Judgment, frequent musters of the | militia, as they are generally, and perhaps ne- ,essariiy conducted, produce no considerable | advantage. They are Onerous to the militia, 1 'y calling them from their homes, and their employments occasion consid- erabie expense, and a loss of time, and un- | 1OubtedIy have Dernicious influence upon",
