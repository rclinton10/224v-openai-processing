Captain Parry came to In\nverness by the Chichester Revenue Cutter, comman-\nded by Capt John Stewart. having fortunately fall\nlen in with Capt s. in the Orknes, on being driven\nin there the 22d ult. The history of the present\nenterprise is brief; and while we have to commune\ncate the agreeable of the safe return of Capt\nParry to his country and friends, able, at the\nsame time to vouch for the accuracy of the follow\nling particulars. Capt. Parry, on leaving the Dis\ncovery Ship at the appointed place. off the Spitz-\nbergen coast betook himself to the sledge boats pre-\npared for his conveyance over the ice in pursuance\nIof his original Intentions and Instructions and was\nout for the space Of sxtyone days. of the boats\nbeing underhis charge, and the other under that\nof Lieut.. Ross. These two boats were hauled over\nthe ice by the crew of the ship, twelve men to each;\nand after undergoing incredible fatigue, they felt\nthat for great part Of the time, they float\ning icebergs which carried them southwark, while\nthey were stretching every nerve to proceed north\nward; and thus, of necessity, they were compelled\nportant fact in the clearest point of view, we have\nto mention that during the last three days ofthe exp\ndtion, and on taking his observations by the chron-\nometer, Capt Parry found that his boats had gained\ntwo miles only. The expedition arrived at latitude\n82 45 and had il proceeded but fifteen miles fur\nther. Capt. Parry and his men would have obtained\nthe pecuniary remuneration to which they enti-\ntitled reaching 49,; but even this short distance\nwas found unattainable by any physical effort Near\nly in the same line we proceeded, to the Hecla. I'm\nmediately on reaching the ship the expedition then\nproceeded homeward. We are happy to add, that\nCapt. Parry his officers and men, are in good health.\n\n\n\nThere is now in Paris female named Elizabeth\nThomas Cordieux, native of Savoy, who was born\non the 9th December, 17l4 !; and who is, in all pro-\nliability, the French say, the Doyenne (the senior)\nuf the human race.

She pas\nsed through Lyons and Dion, where she attended\nher liberal compensation for the benefit they obtain\ned from her presence, people coming from all parts\nto behold the senior Of the hannan race.

The expedition arrived at latitude\n82 45 and had il proceeded but fifteen miles fur\nther. Capt. Parry and his men would have obtained\nthe pecuniary remuneration to which they enti-\ntitled reaching 49,; but even this short distance\nwas found unattainable by any physical effort Near\nly in the same line we proceeded, to the Hecla.
