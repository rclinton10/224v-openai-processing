            "raw_text": "How should the hours OF the Sabbath, tAat\nar. not occupied by public worship. be spent!\nThis question is often asked The answer\nte it must depend in some degree on tne\ncircun stances of the person by whom II is\nmade. 1t is easy to say in general terms that\nthe day should not be spent IN indoience-\nnor sloth-nor worldly pleasure, but that u\nshould be devoted to personal and SOCIAL\nImprovement. The methots best suited 70\naccomplish this end will vary with indlvla-\nal situation. Domestic instruction should\nbe especially regarded on the Sabbath, when\nchildren are released from the exercises OF\nschool, and parents have opportunities OF\nreaching their minds, which their own en-\ngagements during the week may perhaps\nconfne to this season. Charitable sevlces\nare appropriate to the day Visiting the\nmoor and the sick, is an Office to which\nportion of the Sabbath may be given with\npeculiar benefit. Sunday Schools require,\nthe attendance Of considerable number oi\nserious persons, and we know no class OF\nChristians who are entitled to higher com\nmendation, than they who are willing to\nforeeo the pleasures of private meditation and\nreading, that they may give religious IN,\nstruction to the children of the Ignorant and\nvicious. Few persons will find it profitable\nto spend the whole day in seclusion; 1t was\nnot meant to be day of unnatural re-\nstraint. Few also, from their habits, can\nderive pleasure from long continued exer-\nelse of reading. Useful conversation should\nbe NEUTRALITY-SUSPICIOUS. in its tone, but easy\nand interesting, and having, as much as pos\nsble, direct Influence on the religious char'\nacter. Sunday is not a day for fasting. but\nneither is it day for feasting. we sus'\npend our usual pursuits, but it is not sea\nson for idleness to waste, nor for levity tt\nprofane. 1t should be so employed that vt\nmay be better and happier for it through\nthe week.",

The world had caused IT,\n\n\nThe voice of nattery had been poured IN\n\n\nthe ear of the rich and handsome Steinfordi\n\n\nthe eve Of an English maiden had beamed OH\nhim-and Roslne was forgotten.\n\n\ni II ;s not that the heart of man IS unform-\n\n\ned to centre it's affections on one object, anu\nthat one alone; but it is the desire. the pro\"\n\n\nnppsity.

The methots best suited 70\naccomplish this end will vary with indlvla-\nal situation. Domestic instruction should\nbe especially regarded on the Sabbath, when\nchildren are released from the exercises OF\nschool, and parents have opportunities OF\nreaching their minds, which their own en-\ngagements during the week may perhaps\nconfne to this season. Charitable sevlces\nare appropriate to the day Visiting the\nmoor and the sick, is an Office to which\nportion of the Sabbath may be given with\npeculiar benefit. Sunday Schools require,\nthe attendance Of considerable number oi\nserious persons, and we know no class OF\nChristians who are entitled to higher com\nmendation, than they who are willing to\nforeeo the pleasures of private meditation and\nreading, that they may give religious IN,\nstruction to the children of the Ignorant and\nvicious. Few persons will find it profitable\nto spend the whole day in seclusion; 1t was\nnot meant to be day of unnatural re-\nstraint. Few also, from their habits, can\nderive pleasure from long continued exer-\nelse of reading. Useful conversation should\nbe NEUTRALITY-SUSPICIOUS. in its tone, but easy\nand interesting, and having, as much as pos\nsble, direct Influence on the religious char'\nacter. Sunday is not a day for fasting. but\nneither is it day for feasting. we sus'\npend our usual pursuits, but it is not sea\nson for idleness to waste, nor for levity tt\nprofane. 1t should be so employed that vt\nmay be better and happier for it through\nthe week.",
