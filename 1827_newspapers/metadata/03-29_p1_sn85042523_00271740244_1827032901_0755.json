In\nhis comfortable homestead, and hoary with\n\n\nage, he would delight the young with tales\n\n\nof fearful interest of the Indian wars, while\n\n\nhis own wars ended, at peace with the world,\n\n\nhe feebly trimmed the lamp of life, which,\nhaving burned for more than eighty years,\n\n\ncould but for little longer be kept from\n\n\nsinking in its socket\n\n\notwithstanding his perfect reverence for\n\n\nhis patron, this old soldier weuld sometimes.\n\n\npresuming on the privilege of age and long\n\n\nservices, chafe his protector on points of ex-\n! pedency, though never on those of obedi-\n\n\ncnce.

The ancient follow\n\n\ner of Braddock, however, knew his man,\n\n\nand knew exactly what was best to do; he\n\n\nwisely became silent; and the storm which\n\n\nappeared to be brooding quickly passed e.\n\n\nway, when a returning sunshine cheered\nwith the warmth of its kindness the veteran\n\n\nof '56.\n\n\nThe Washington family were subjected\n\n\n10 hereditary gout-the Chief never expert\nenced pang. His temperance, and the en-\n, ergetic employment of both his body and\n\n\nmind, seemed to forbid the approach of a dis\n\n\nease. which severely afflicted several of his\n\n\nkindred. His illnesses were of rare occur\n\n\nrenee, but were particularly severe; his a\n\n\nversion to the uses of medicine was extreme:\n\n\nfor, even when in great suffering, it was only\n\n\nby the entreaties of his lady, and the respect\n\n\ntul, yet beseeching look, of his oldest friend\nand companion in arms, (Dr. James Craik, }\n\n\nchat he could be prevailed upon to take the\n\n\nslightest preparation of medicine.
