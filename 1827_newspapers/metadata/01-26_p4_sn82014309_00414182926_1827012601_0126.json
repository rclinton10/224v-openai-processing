The whole number of Paez's troops cannot be estimated at more than 5000, ,probably less. The citizens of Caracas and Venezuela are apparently opposed to all these meas ures, and are loudly crying for peace on any terms.

The mis- tress of the house, after seeing it was dis engaged, apparently not much hurt, turn- ed to go to another part of the room. Presently the mother of the kitten came in, went up to it, and then flew furiously at the mistress of the house, first biting and scratching her legs and thighs and arms, and proceeding to her neck, upon which she fixed the woman used her hands to preserve her eyes, lowering her head to save her throat, her cries alarmed her hus- band, who came into the room to her as- sistance the cat then let go her hold, re- ceived kick, passed unde the stove to the other side of it, where she was followed by the man, she then repassed making again at the woman but being pursued she went out the door, which was immediately clos- cd. She then began to fly up against the door uttering hideous cries; the family was so much alarmed that assistance was had, and finally the cat was killed on entering the door, partially opened for the purpose. The woman was much hurt. but her wounds are nearly healed.

After he left the cellar, the two Forsyths offered the fireman of the steam boat, Long Branch, who was present, three dollars if he would Ego and beat the d-d rascal\" while they were to stand by with clubs, and knock the first man down who attempted to interfere The frman clo- sed with the proposal, followed Spencer, and knocked him down in the street. Af- ter some struggle, Spencer succeeded in getting to the Hole-n-the-Wal public house, though not until he had received a severe foging. The fireman afterwards went to Spencer, expressed his sorrow for what he had done, and by way of settle ment paid him the three dollars received from the Forsyth, and took his receipt in full for the Aoging. Spencer afterwards died, and on Saturday the fireman and two Forsyths were lodged in gaol to await their trial. The same day, Saturday the wife of Spencer, being somewhat intoxica- ted met Mrs Barns, who was no friend of hers. A quarrel ensued, severe blows were interchanged, and Mrs. went off severely pounded. Yesterday morning she died; and the deceased Spencer's widow was lodged in prison with those who had compassed tbn death of her husband-a!l to meet their trials together.",

PacZ. First.\n\n The persons who are considered the prime\n\n movers of this faction, are said to be Dr..\n\n Pena, Col. Carabana, and one other per-\n\n son whose name is not recollected. These\n\n are the advisers of Gen. Paez aud Gen.\n\n Merino, but Gen. Paez in particular, as\n\n Chief in command. Dr. Pena is said to\n\n be a man of the greatest talents, who has\n\n figured as such in intrigue during the whole\n\n of the Revolution. He held civil office\n\n high in the government, (believed first\n\n Judge in the high court of Bogota, and\n\n was implicated or impeached for some mis-\n\n confederation which he was entrusted\n\n with about 50O,OOO dollars at Bogota or\n\n Carthagena, to deliver at Caracas, by the\n\n Government of Colombia, being for the benefit of the landholders, loan for them, or a part of one of the Engliah loans, ap- propriated for the planters on bond and mortgage-Pena receipted for the amount in dollars. There is a difference in the value of currency, or cut money, at Car thagena and Bogota, from the value at La Guayra and Caracas; at the former $l6 of cut money is equal to doubloon, and at the latter SIS to the doubloon. Pena made disposition of his cut money and invested the amount in doubloons, and on his arrival at Caracas, he answered the receipt of so many dollars, in doubloons at SIS, thereby realizing 12 12 per cent nett profit. His conduct was made sub- ject of severe remark in the public news papers, and he replied, II receipted for so many dollars; ! have paid the same a. mount of dollars, ,and have made certain sum of money by the operation; and if this is crime go to Bogota where learnt my vices, for remedy\" He was under arrest at the time of the Paez insurrec- ton.\n\n Pena stated to friend of the writer at Caracas, that his country had disgraced him, had robbed him of his honor, and he should do all in his power to ruin the gov- \n\n Caraband.-Of this man, who held al Colonel's commission, the writer knows\n\n little, except that he is represented as pos- sessing fine talents, and was educated in Europe. Pena and Carabana are the prin- cipal advisers of Paez.\n\n MorinO.-This man who holds the of ice of second Military Chief under Paez, las been it is believed a long time dissat- sGed with the rulers of Bogota. He is represented as a turbulent spirit, destitute ] of principle, and of flimited talents, but one who was disappointed at not receiving such appointments from the government of Bogota, as were in his opinion equal to lis merits.\n\n Pacz.-A great deal has been said of his man, and frequently he has been ter ned negro. The writer has frequently 'een him. He is about five feet and seven nches in height,e stout muscular frame, asd very keen black eye. His complex ion is dark (though not darker than many of our countrymen) but nothing of the ne- gro he is fairly termed Creole of the country. Paez is said to be an illiterate man, and until the recent events in Vene- zuela was considered an honest man and 1 true patriot. But in consequence of his arrest, owing to his conduct relative to the citizens and militia, it is believed he be- came exasperated against the general gov ernment. Although he took the civil pow CT into his own hands, yet it was believed the state of the country justified it. That Gen. Paez at the time of his arrest was much irritated, and that his passions were then worked upon by Pena and his other advisers, cannot be doubted, and has even\n\n been proved by his subsequent conduct in joining these people for remedy of abu-\n\n ses. That Paez on reflection has most\n\n sincerely regretted it, there is no doubt.-\n\n He is now placed in situation of great\n\n hazard. It is believed he will use his en- deavors to prevent any bloodseed, and re- tain his command until the arrival of Boli- var, when his conduct will probably be overlooked, whatever may be the fate of his advisers. Venezuela as regards the\n\n General Government is certainly in a more\n\n promising state than many suppose. Col.\n\n Ruiz on the east holds possession of Gu\n\n mana with force of 900 men. He is one\n\n of the Paez faction. Gen. Bermudez, who\n\n attacked Cumana in November, and was\n\n defeated, and retired to Barcelona, short\n\n distance west of Cumana, on the coast. is\n\n one of the generals of the revolution. and",

In England they always have what we call very open winter, the weather changeable, and the ground bare the greater part of the time. Every one has observed the greater diff culty in keeping a stock upon straw in such winter. They also feed their straw to horses, COWS and oxen' and they would as soon waste their hay as their strw; and cannot perceive why it is not as useful for Vermont farmer to make s use of his straw for fodder as for the Eng fish farmer. I heard very intelligent and successful farmer of this county remark some years since, that he could not afford to keep stock of cattle without raising grain so that he could feed them princi- pally with straw, nor could he afford to raise grain unless he kept stock of cattle to feed upon his straw. But to make the best use of straw for the feed either of cattle or horses, it has long since been found that it is necessary to cut it in some kind of machine. The Dutch from their first settlement in the Stase of New York, kept their horses on cut straw and meal, making use of very simple machine con- slsting only of a box and knife, and this was the only machine for cutting straw known in New England until within few years past. In England various machines for cutting straw have been invented and in general use, but as is the case with most of the English labor saving machines, they are too complicated and too expensive ; those now in general use cost from fifty to eighty dollars. A variety of machines fol cutting straw have been invented in New England, more simple in their construction and less expensive the most valuable O. these is Saford's Straw Cutter. Accor ding to accounts given of Straw Cutters, straw can be cut by none of them with greater facility or despatch than with this although it costs but about one third the sum that those cost.\n\n A late Bordeaux paper relates the fol- lowing singular occurrence in the neigh borhood of that city: An old woman wh had formerly kept hotel, avowed to he confessor that she had amassed large sur of money which she kept in her house, Soon after this confession, made at tn tribunal of penitence, she permitted al old position who had formely lived witt her to sleep in her house. About o'clock at night some one knocked loudl at her door, and asked in pitiful voic to be admitted to her hospitality for tn night. Believing herself safe by hay ing the position in the house, the woma opened the door, when in rushed ( ma hidden by mask and armed with pistols who said, deliver me your money or will instantly kill you !'' The poor wo man at first was almost frightened to deat but gained little courage, conducted tn robber into the chamber where the post ilion was sleeping; he having heard ther coming in, hid himself behind the curtains My money is in that closet,\" said tn woman, at the same time showing an ol, peice or furniture almost hidden by a pill of linen.

But should he not, PaeZ has on the east Bermudez with many troops, on the south Meserez with 1900 men, and on the west Porto Cabello with the troops there opposed to him. The whole number of Paez's troops cannot be estimated at more than 5000, ,probably less. The citizens of Caracas and Venezuela are apparently opposed to all these meas ures, and are loudly crying for peace on any terms. The people in the interior know little and care less for the political state of the country. IfBolivar makes his appearance in Venezuek, doubtless all political troubles will be immediately qui- eted.-Mer.

The mis- tress of the house, after seeing it was dis engaged, apparently not much hurt, turn- ed to go to another part of the room. Presently the mother of the kitten came in, went up to it, and then flew furiously at the mistress of the house, first biting and scratching her legs and thighs and arms, and proceeding to her neck, upon which she fixed the woman used her hands to preserve her eyes, lowering her head to save her throat, her cries alarmed her hus- band, who came into the room to her as- sistance the cat then let go her hold, re- ceived kick, passed unde the stove to the other side of it, where she was followed by the man, she then repassed making again at the woman but being pursued she went out the door, which was immediately clos- cd. She then began to fly up against the door uttering hideous cries; the family was so much alarmed that assistance was had, and finally the cat was killed on entering the door, partially opened for the purpose. The woman was much hurt. but her wounds are nearly healed. The cat had frequent ly shown symptoms of boldness and feroci- ty, when irritated, but never before in a way to excite alarm in the family.",

We learn from correspondent at New London, that on Monday night last, u quarrel took place in cellar, occupied as grocery, between a man by the name of Spencer, and two brothers by the name of Forsyth. Spencer was, or had been, sailor. After he left the cellar, the two Forsyths offered the fireman of the steam boat, Long Branch, who was present, three dollars if he would Ego and beat the d-d rascal\" while they were to stand by with clubs, and knock the first man down who attempted to interfere The frman clo- sed with the proposal, followed Spencer, and knocked him down in the street. Af- ter some struggle, Spencer succeeded in getting to the Hole-n-the-Wal public house, though not until he had received a severe foging. The fireman afterwards went to Spencer, expressed his sorrow for what he had done, and by way of settle ment paid him the three dollars received from the Forsyth, and took his receipt in full for the Aoging. Spencer afterwards died, and on Saturday the fireman and two Forsyths were lodged in gaol to await their trial. The same day, Saturday the wife of Spencer, being somewhat intoxica- ted met Mrs Barns, who was no friend of hers. A quarrel ensued, severe blows were interchanged, and Mrs. went off severely pounded. Yesterday morning she died; and the deceased Spencer's widow was lodged in prison with those who had compassed tbn death of her husband-a!l to meet their trials together.",

PacZ. First.\n\n The persons who are considered the prime\n\n movers of this faction, are said to be Dr..\n\n Pena, Col. Carabana, and one other per-\n\n son whose name is not recollected. These\n\n are the advisers of Gen. Paez aud Gen.\n\n Merino, but Gen. Paez in particular, as\n\n Chief in command. Dr. Pena is said to\n\n be a man of the greatest talents, who has\n\n figured as such in intrigue during the whole\n\n of the Revolution. He held civil office\n\n high in the government, (believed first\n\n Judge in the high court of Bogota, and\n\n was implicated or impeached for some mis-\n\n confederation which he was entrusted\n\n with about 50O,OOO dollars at Bogota or\n\n Carthagena, to deliver at Caracas, by the\n\n Government of Colombia, being for the benefit of the landholders, loan for them, or a part of one of the Engliah loans, ap- propriated for the planters on bond and mortgage-Pena receipted for the amount in dollars. There is a difference in the value of currency, or cut money, at Car thagena and Bogota, from the value at La Guayra and Caracas; at the former $l6 of cut money is equal to doubloon, and at the latter SIS to the doubloon. Pena made disposition of his cut money and invested the amount in doubloons, and on his arrival at Caracas, he answered the receipt of so many dollars, in doubloons at SIS, thereby realizing 12 12 per cent nett profit. His conduct was made sub- ject of severe remark in the public news papers, and he replied, II receipted for so many dollars; ! have paid the same a. mount of dollars, ,and have made certain sum of money by the operation; and if this is crime go to Bogota where learnt my vices, for remedy\" He was under arrest at the time of the Paez insurrec- ton.\n\n Pena stated to friend of the writer at Caracas, that his country had disgraced him, had robbed him of his honor, and he should do all in his power to ruin the gov- \n\n Caraband.-Of this man, who held al Colonel's commission, the writer knows\n\n little, except that he is represented as pos- sessing fine talents, and was educated in Europe. Pena and Carabana are the prin- cipal advisers of Paez.\n\n MorinO.-This man who holds the of ice of second Military Chief under Paez, las been it is believed a long time dissat- sGed with the rulers of Bogota. He is represented as a turbulent spirit, destitute ] of principle, and of flimited talents, but one who was disappointed at not receiving such appointments from the government of Bogota, as were in his opinion equal to lis merits.\n\n Pacz.-A great deal has been said of his man, and frequently he has been ter ned negro. The writer has frequently 'een him. He is about five feet and seven nches in height,e stout muscular frame, asd very keen black eye. His complex ion is dark (though not darker than many of our countrymen) but nothing of the ne- gro he is fairly termed Creole of the country. Paez is said to be an illiterate man, and until the recent events in Vene- zuela was considered an honest man and 1 true patriot. But in consequence of his arrest, owing to his conduct relative to the citizens and militia, it is believed he be- came exasperated against the general gov ernment. Although he took the civil pow CT into his own hands, yet it was believed the state of the country justified it. That Gen. Paez at the time of his arrest was much irritated, and that his passions were then worked upon by Pena and his other advisers, cannot be doubted, and has even\n\n been proved by his subsequent conduct in joining these people for remedy of abu-\n\n ses. That Paez on reflection has most\n\n sincerely regretted it, there is no doubt.-\n\n He is now placed in situation of great\n\n hazard. It is believed he will use his en- deavors to prevent any bloodseed, and re- tain his command until the arrival of Boli- var, when his conduct will probably be overlooked, whatever may be the fate of his advisers. Venezuela as regards the\n\n General Government is certainly in a more\n\n promising state than many suppose. Col.\n\n Ruiz on the east holds possession of Gu\n\n mana with force of 900 men. He is one\n\n of the Paez faction. Gen. Bermudez, who\n\n attacked Cumana in November, and was\n\n defeated, and retired to Barcelona, short\n\n distance west of Cumana, on the coast. is\n\n one of the generals of the revolution. and",

            "article": "S1 1hAVs\n\n In England, wheat and rye straw are as carefully preserved and as economical- lv expended for fodder as hay.-Every farmer has what he calls his staw yard, where his young stock is kept wholly on straw, and this notwithstanding the disad- vantages of the climate. In England they always have what we call very open winter, the weather changeable, and the ground bare the greater part of the time. Every one has observed the greater diff culty in keeping a stock upon straw in such winter. They also feed their straw to horses, COWS and oxen' and they would as soon waste their hay as their strw; and cannot perceive why it is not as useful for Vermont farmer to make s use of his straw for fodder as for the Eng fish farmer. I heard very intelligent and successful farmer of this county remark some years since, that he could not afford to keep stock of cattle without raising grain so that he could feed them princi- pally with straw, nor could he afford to raise grain unless he kept stock of cattle to feed upon his straw. But to make the best use of straw for the feed either of cattle or horses, it has long since been found that it is necessary to cut it in some kind of machine. The Dutch from their first settlement in the Stase of New York, kept their horses on cut straw and meal, making use of very simple machine con- slsting only of a box and knife, and this was the only machine for cutting straw known in New England until within few years past. In England various machines for cutting straw have been invented and in general use, but as is the case with most of the English labor saving machines, they are too complicated and too expensive ; those now in general use cost from fifty to eighty dollars. A variety of machines fol cutting straw have been invented in New England, more simple in their construction and less expensive the most valuable O. these is Saford's Straw Cutter. Accor ding to accounts given of Straw Cutters, straw can be cut by none of them with greater facility or despatch than with this although it costs but about one third the sum that those cost.\n\n A late Bordeaux paper relates the fol- lowing singular occurrence in the neigh borhood of that city: An old woman wh had formerly kept hotel, avowed to he confessor that she had amassed large sur of money which she kept in her house, Soon after this confession, made at tn tribunal of penitence, she permitted al old position who had formely lived witt her to sleep in her house. About o'clock at night some one knocked loudl at her door, and asked in pitiful voic to be admitted to her hospitality for tn night. Believing herself safe by hay ing the position in the house, the woma opened the door, when in rushed ( ma hidden by mask and armed with pistols who said, deliver me your money or will instantly kill you !'' The poor wo man at first was almost frightened to deat but gained little courage, conducted tn robber into the chamber where the post ilion was sleeping; he having heard ther coming in, hid himself behind the curtains My money is in that closet,\" said tn woman, at the same time showing an ol, peice or furniture almost hidden by a pill of linen. The robber, laying his pistol on the table, prepared to take possession of her riches, but the postilion who hac observed his movements with great san!",
