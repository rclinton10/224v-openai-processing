In the midst of the bus,le the captain was sum- moned below, as it was said Campbell was dead, and his wife was dying. On enter ing the cabin, Mrs. Campbell was discov- cred lying on the bed in a swoon, beside the lifeless body of her husband. The melancholy expression of Campbell's coun- tenance still remained in death; but there was serenity about it which spoke more of hope than despair, though every line plain ly indicated deep rooted wretchedness.- Mrs. Campbell was gently removed from the body around which she clung in the agony of grief.\n\n 1t was scene caculated to awaken the sympathies of all present, and even the philosophical Frenchman, \"though \" all un- used to the melting mood,\" opened the sluices of his heart, and his time-beaten cheek was bedewed with a tear, though for years it had been moistened alone by the sea or the tempest. He caught my eye, and understood what was passing in my mind he wiped his tears away, and in vain attempted to assume the philosopher again. As we turned from the disconso- late woman, the captain muttered to him. self, \"oui, oui, je suis philosophe, nlais, ie suis honme\" I replied, |\" that being a man, it was impossible that philosophy should deaden the feelings to a scene of that description\" |\" can bear,' said he, like Seneca or Diogenes, whatever bur- then may be cast on my own shoulders, but not the aff1ictions that are visited on the heads of others\" grasped his hand: inc understood the pressure, and returned it.\n\n The storm continued with unabated fu- Sy, and as night approached, it was deem- ed expedient to consigu the remains of Campbell to watery grave. Prepara- tions were accordingly made, and the body was literally torn from the agonizing em- brace of the disconsolate wife, and wrap ped in saileloth to receive the last human rites. It was now light when the corpse was placed upon deck. The captain, the passengers and such of the crew as were not engaged, stood around it. Becoming sorrow was depicted in every countenance. Torches were brought, and l read brief service before consigning the body to the waves. Having performed this duty, Mrs. Campbell was gently raised from the corpse, over which she had knelt during the service, and two sailors taking hold of it by the head and feet, committed it to the sea. The heart-broken widow swooned. The solemn plunge was distinctly heard, and immediately followed by iend-like laugh. I turned to discover whence this ill-timed merriment proceeded, and beheld amongst the crowd, the ghastly visage of the ship-wrecked man. The clothing from his bed was wrapped around him, and his features were horribly distorted. He still laughed historically, and as the light of the torches rested on the dark surface of an as- cending pillow, and disclosed where the unhappy Campbell foated in his winding sheet, the sailor pointed at it and shouted with laughter. We were all struck with amazement; but on-securing him we dis covered that he had become a maniac.- The cause remained a mystery, but the physician aseribed it to the agitation his mind must have undergone at being inno- gently charged with murder, and to having exposed himself to the night breeze, whilst under the influence of burning fever.- He considered the explanation both learn ed and natural, and as no one on board was profound or bold enough to contradict a man whose businessit it was to deal out life and death at pleasure, his opinion was ta- ken, as we usually take physic, without ex- animation, and consequently received full as much credit as it deserved.\n\n Day after day passed on, and still the contending elements threatened us with destruction. Our ship had become mate.",

The unsuspect- ing and innocent maid discarded him who deserved her, and placed her hopes on a wretch defled with duplicity and baseness. We were married.

The thought horrible as it was, allayed tho poignancy of my feelings. My business necessarily drew me from home for months together.

If so, who can blame them if in a mc ment of phrenzy they spurned aside the miscre- ant who stood between them and happi- ness.

The sails and rig ging were torn away piece by piece; the masts were splintered, and finally there was little left but the hulk of the beautiful ship which had but few days before sailed so proudly over the waves. To add to our distress, on trying the pumps we found that there were foufsfeet of water in the hold. The alarm of all on board increased, and I could perceive by the heightened physi- ognomy of the captain, that he had never stood more in need of his philosophy than at that moment. He however still stormed at the sailors to urge them to exertion, and calmly quoted Seneca to satisfy himself of the vanity of life.\n\n The sailors labored night and day at the pumps to keep us afoat. We had been driven in this manner at the mercy of the waves for about week, every day the leak increasing, but as the wind was favor able, and we constantly sailed in nearly the same direction, we still hoped to reach some haven in safety. On the tenth day, when even the most sanguine began to de- spair, our dropping spirits were revived by the sight of land. The sea was running high, and we rapidly approached the coast, but our feelings of joy at thesprospect of being rescued from a watery grave, were now changed into those of terror, for the helmsman had lost all controul over the ship, and there were breakers ahead, upon which she must inevitably strike and go to pieces. The captain foresaw the danger, and ordered the long boat to be got in readiness. He then awaited patiently the moment that should decide our fate. The interval was truly awful, and as stood ga- zing on the coast now so near us, felt that death in the midst of the dreary waste of waters would not have been so terrible as in the sight of the haunts of men and place. of safety. All were assembled on deck: we drew near to the spot where the furious waves were lashed into foam: eve- ry eye was fixed upon it, and each held his breath in dreadful suspense, as the wreck was borne aloft by the irresistible surft was to dash it upon the pointed rocks indstincty seen in the chasm beneath.- The vessel struck, which was denoted by a shriek of terror. The long boat was has, tily lowered, and we got on board as speedi- ly as practicable. The little captain even in this extremity displayed the influence of the precepts of Seneca and Boetheus on his mind he was the last to leave the ship, though the fury of the waves threatened every moment to dash her to pieces. The boat pushed off from the wreck; it was we'll manned, and in few minutes we were beyond the danger of the breakers. Our eyes were still turned towards the ship, which was laboring to pass the shell wing rock, when suddenly two figures ap- pealed on board. Our hearts sunk within us, and each anxiously looked around to see if his friend were with us. A voice near me, scarcely articulate with grief, sobbed, Oh! my mother, my dear moth- CT !'' turned and beheld Mrs. Campbell's child in the arms of the boatswain. Those left behind proved to be the maniac, and the unhappy female, Mrs. Campbell. The Captain ordered the boat to put back, and we endeavored to approach the wreck, but in vain. The safety of those in the boat obliged us to desist, and with heavy hearts we turned round the prov towards the shore. The child continued to cry, my mother, my dear mother, Oh! take me back to my mother,\" while the rough boat swain, as he endeavored to sooth her, mingled his tears with hers.\n\n The figures on the wreck appeared un- concerned at their approaching fate. Mrs. Campbell was seen kneeiing at the feet of the maniac, who stood in the attitude of devotion. He placed his hand on her head, and raised his eyes, as if asking for giveness for her sins. He bent forward, and touched her forehead with his lips She arose and fell upon his bosom. He gave her one agonized embrace; her slen- der form lay upon his left arm, and his right was raised towards heaven. The ship was thrown violently on the breakers, went to pieces, and the objects of our solicitude disappeared among the waves.\n\n We reached the shore in safety, and soon learnt that we were on the coast of Spain. We found shelter in the cottages of the peasants, and the succeeding day, as the sailors were searching the strand for whatever might be washed ashore from the wreck they found the bodies of Mrs. Camp bell and the maniac locked in each others embrace; and as death had united those ,yho ;n life had heen r,arted we did not",

P.B. 1 The following anecdote is quoted from the last Philadelph Quarterly. The re- view of American Biography, from which this is taken, contains a number of interest ing indidents and characters.\n\n When the British army held possession of Philadelphia, Gen. Howe's headquarters were in Second-st. the fourth door below Spruce, in a house which was before occu- pied by Gen. Cadwallader. Directly op- posite, resided William and Lydia Darrah, members ofthe society of friends. A supe- rior officer of the Army, supposed to be the adjutant general fixed upon one of their chambers, back room, for private conference; and two of them frequently met there with fire and candies in close con- Sultation. About the 2d of December, the adjutant-general told Lydia that they would be at the room at o'clock, and remain late and that they wished the family to re- tire early to bed adding, that when they were going away they would call her to let them out, and extinguish their fires and candles. She accordingly sept all the fam lily to bed but as tho officer had been so particular her curiosity was excited. She took off her shoes, and put her ear to the key-hole of the conclave, and overheard an order read for all the British troops to march out late in the evening of the 4th, and attack Gen. Washington's army then encalnpedat White Marsh. On hearing this she return ed to her chamber, and laid down. Soon after, the officers knocked at the door, but she rose only at the third summons, having feigned herself asleep. Her mind was much agitated, so that from this. moment she could neither eat nor sleep supposing it to be in her power to save the lives of thousands of her fellow-countrymen; but not know ing how she was to convey the information to Gen. Washington, not daring to confde it to her husband. The time left, however, was short. She quickly determined to make her way, as soon as possible, to the A. merican outposts. She informed her family, that, as she was out of flour, she would go to Frankford for some 1; her husband insist ed that she should take the servant maid with her, but to his surprize she positively refused. She got access to Gen. Howe, & solicited, what he readily granted, pass thro' the British troops on the lines. Leav- ing her bag at the mill. she hastened toward the American lines, and encountered on her way an American lieutenant colonel Craig) of the light horse, who with some of his men was on the lookout for information. He knew her, and enquired where she was go- ing2 She answered, in quest of her son, an officer in the American army, and prayed the colonel to alight and walk with her, He did so, ordering his troops to keep in sight. To him she disclosed her secret, ,af- ter having obtained from him solemn promise never to betray her individually, as her life might be at stake with the Brit ish.\n\n He conducted her to house near at hand directed something for her to eat, and hast ened to head quarters, and brought Gen. Washington acquainted with what he had heard. Washington made, of course, all preparation for bafi1ing the meditated sur- prize. Lydia returned home with her four, sat up alone to watch the movement of the\n\n British troops; heard their footsteps; but\n\n when they returned, in few days after, did not dare to ask question, though so- lictous to learn the event. The next eve- ming the Adj. General came in, and re- quested her to walk up to his room as he wished to put some questions. She follow ed him ill terror; and when he locked the door and begged her, withan air of myste- ry, to be seated, she was sure that she was either suspected or had been betrayed He enquired earnestly whether any ofher family were up the last night he and the officers met she told him that they all retired at O clock.

In the midst of the bus,le the captain was sum- moned below, as it was said Campbell was dead, and his wife was dying. On enter ing the cabin, Mrs. Campbell was discov- cred lying on the bed in a swoon, beside the lifeless body of her husband. The melancholy expression of Campbell's coun- tenance still remained in death; but there was serenity about it which spoke more of hope than despair, though every line plain ly indicated deep rooted wretchedness.- Mrs. Campbell was gently removed from the body around which she clung in the agony of grief.\n\n 1t was scene caculated to awaken the sympathies of all present, and even the philosophical Frenchman, \"though \" all un- used to the melting mood,\" opened the sluices of his heart, and his time-beaten cheek was bedewed with a tear, though for years it had been moistened alone by the sea or the tempest. He caught my eye, and understood what was passing in my mind he wiped his tears away, and in vain attempted to assume the philosopher again. As we turned from the disconso- late woman, the captain muttered to him. self, \"oui, oui, je suis philosophe, nlais, ie suis honme\" I replied, |\" that being a man, it was impossible that philosophy should deaden the feelings to a scene of that description\" |\" can bear,' said he, like Seneca or Diogenes, whatever bur- then may be cast on my own shoulders, but not the aff1ictions that are visited on the heads of others\" grasped his hand: inc understood the pressure, and returned it.\n\n The storm continued with unabated fu- Sy, and as night approached, it was deem- ed expedient to consigu the remains of Campbell to watery grave. Prepara- tions were accordingly made, and the body was literally torn from the agonizing em- brace of the disconsolate wife, and wrap ped in saileloth to receive the last human rites. It was now light when the corpse was placed upon deck. The captain, the passengers and such of the crew as were not engaged, stood around it. Becoming sorrow was depicted in every countenance. Torches were brought, and l read brief service before consigning the body to the waves. Having performed this duty, Mrs. Campbell was gently raised from the corpse, over which she had knelt during the service, and two sailors taking hold of it by the head and feet, committed it to the sea. The heart-broken widow swooned. The solemn plunge was distinctly heard, and immediately followed by iend-like laugh. I turned to discover whence this ill-timed merriment proceeded, and beheld amongst the crowd, the ghastly visage of the ship-wrecked man. The clothing from his bed was wrapped around him, and his features were horribly distorted. He still laughed historically, and as the light of the torches rested on the dark surface of an as- cending pillow, and disclosed where the unhappy Campbell foated in his winding sheet, the sailor pointed at it and shouted with laughter. We were all struck with amazement; but on-securing him we dis covered that he had become a maniac.- The cause remained a mystery, but the physician aseribed it to the agitation his mind must have undergone at being inno- gently charged with murder, and to having exposed himself to the night breeze, whilst under the influence of burning fever.- He considered the explanation both learn ed and natural, and as no one on board was profound or bold enough to contradict a man whose businessit it was to deal out life and death at pleasure, his opinion was ta- ken, as we usually take physic, without ex- animation, and consequently received full as much credit as it deserved.\n\n Day after day passed on, and still the contending elements threatened us with destruction.

The unsuspect- ing and innocent maid discarded him who deserved her, and placed her hopes on a wretch defled with duplicity and baseness. We were married.

If so, who can blame them if in a mc ment of phrenzy they spurned aside the miscre- ant who stood between them and happi- ness.

            "article": "cy of the storm alarm began to DC Felt by all on board, and even the philoSoph- cal captain at length betrayed some appre- hensions for our safety. The sails and rig ging were torn away piece by piece; the masts were splintered, and finally there was little left but the hulk of the beautiful ship which had but few days before sailed so proudly over the waves. To add to our distress, on trying the pumps we found that there were foufsfeet of water in the hold. The alarm of all on board increased, and I could perceive by the heightened physi- ognomy of the captain, that he had never stood more in need of his philosophy than at that moment. He however still stormed at the sailors to urge them to exertion, and calmly quoted Seneca to satisfy himself of the vanity of life.\n\n The sailors labored night and day at the pumps to keep us afoat. We had been driven in this manner at the mercy of the waves for about week, every day the leak increasing, but as the wind was favor able, and we constantly sailed in nearly the same direction, we still hoped to reach some haven in safety. On the tenth day, when even the most sanguine began to de- spair, our dropping spirits were revived by the sight of land. The sea was running high, and we rapidly approached the coast, but our feelings of joy at thesprospect of being rescued from a watery grave, were now changed into those of terror, for the helmsman had lost all controul over the ship, and there were breakers ahead, upon which she must inevitably strike and go to pieces. The captain foresaw the danger, and ordered the long boat to be got in readiness. He then awaited patiently the moment that should decide our fate. The interval was truly awful, and as stood ga- zing on the coast now so near us, felt that death in the midst of the dreary waste of waters would not have been so terrible as in the sight of the haunts of men and place. of safety. All were assembled on deck: we drew near to the spot where the furious waves were lashed into foam: eve- ry eye was fixed upon it, and each held his breath in dreadful suspense, as the wreck was borne aloft by the irresistible surft was to dash it upon the pointed rocks indstincty seen in the chasm beneath.- The vessel struck, which was denoted by a shriek of terror. The long boat was has, tily lowered, and we got on board as speedi- ly as practicable. The little captain even in this extremity displayed the influence of the precepts of Seneca and Boetheus on his mind he was the last to leave the ship, though the fury of the waves threatened every moment to dash her to pieces. The boat pushed off from the wreck; it was we'll manned, and in few minutes we were beyond the danger of the breakers. Our eyes were still turned towards the ship, which was laboring to pass the shell wing rock, when suddenly two figures ap- pealed on board. Our hearts sunk within us, and each anxiously looked around to see if his friend were with us. A voice near me, scarcely articulate with grief, sobbed, Oh! my mother, my dear moth- CT !'' turned and beheld Mrs. Campbell's child in the arms of the boatswain. Those left behind proved to be the maniac, and the unhappy female, Mrs. Campbell. The Captain ordered the boat to put back, and we endeavored to approach the wreck, but in vain. The safety of those in the boat obliged us to desist, and with heavy hearts we turned round the prov towards the shore. The child continued to cry, my mother, my dear mother, Oh! take me back to my mother,\" while the rough boat swain, as he endeavored to sooth her, mingled his tears with hers.\n\n The figures on the wreck appeared un- concerned at their approaching fate. Mrs. Campbell was seen kneeiing at the feet of the maniac, who stood in the attitude of devotion. He placed his hand on her head, and raised his eyes, as if asking for giveness for her sins. He bent forward, and touched her forehead with his lips She arose and fell upon his bosom. He gave her one agonized embrace; her slen- der form lay upon his left arm, and his right was raised towards heaven. The ship was thrown violently on the breakers, went to pieces, and the objects of our solicitude disappeared among the waves.\n\n We reached the shore in safety, and soon learnt that we were on the coast of Spain. We found shelter in the cottages of the peasants, and the succeeding day, as the sailors were searching the strand for whatever might be washed ashore from the wreck they found the bodies of Mrs. Camp bell and the maniac locked in each others embrace; and as death had united those ,yho ;n life had heen r,arted we did not",

P.B. 1 The following anecdote is quoted from the last Philadelph Quarterly. The re- view of American Biography, from which this is taken, contains a number of interest ing indidents and characters.\n\n When the British army held possession of Philadelphia, Gen. Howe's headquarters were in Second-st. the fourth door below Spruce, in a house which was before occu- pied by Gen. Cadwallader. Directly op- posite, resided William and Lydia Darrah, members ofthe society of friends. A supe- rior officer of the Army, supposed to be the adjutant general fixed upon one of their chambers, back room, for private conference; and two of them frequently met there with fire and candies in close con- Sultation. About the 2d of December, the adjutant-general told Lydia that they would be at the room at o'clock, and remain late and that they wished the family to re- tire early to bed adding, that when they were going away they would call her to let them out, and extinguish their fires and candles. She accordingly sept all the fam lily to bed but as tho officer had been so particular her curiosity was excited. She took off her shoes, and put her ear to the key-hole of the conclave, and overheard an order read for all the British troops to march out late in the evening of the 4th, and attack Gen. Washington's army then encalnpedat White Marsh. On hearing this she return ed to her chamber, and laid down. Soon after, the officers knocked at the door, but she rose only at the third summons, having feigned herself asleep. Her mind was much agitated, so that from this. moment she could neither eat nor sleep supposing it to be in her power to save the lives of thousands of her fellow-countrymen; but not know ing how she was to convey the information to Gen. Washington, not daring to confde it to her husband. The time left, however, was short. She quickly determined to make her way, as soon as possible, to the A. merican outposts. She informed her family, that, as she was out of flour, she would go to Frankford for some 1; her husband insist ed that she should take the servant maid with her, but to his surprize she positively refused. She got access to Gen. Howe, & solicited, what he readily granted, pass thro' the British troops on the lines. Leav- ing her bag at the mill. she hastened toward the American lines, and encountered on her way an American lieutenant colonel Craig) of the light horse, who with some of his men was on the lookout for information. He knew her, and enquired where she was go- ing2 She answered, in quest of her son, an officer in the American army, and prayed the colonel to alight and walk with her, He did so, ordering his troops to keep in sight. To him she disclosed her secret, ,af- ter having obtained from him solemn promise never to betray her individually, as her life might be at stake with the Brit ish.\n\n He conducted her to house near at hand directed something for her to eat, and hast ened to head quarters, and brought Gen. Washington acquainted with what he had heard. Washington made, of course, all preparation for bafi1ing the meditated sur- prize. Lydia returned home with her four, sat up alone to watch the movement of the\n\n British troops; heard their footsteps; but\n\n when they returned, in few days after, did not dare to ask question, though so- lictous to learn the event. The next eve- ming the Adj. General came in, and re- quested her to walk up to his room as he wished to put some questions. She follow ed him ill terror; and when he locked the door and begged her, withan air of myste- ry, to be seated, she was sure that she was either suspected or had been betrayed He enquired earnestly whether any ofher family were up the last night he and the officers met she told him that they all retired at O clock. He observed 'sI knew you were asleep, for I knocked at your chamber door three times before you heard me am entirely at loss to ima- zine who gave Gen.
