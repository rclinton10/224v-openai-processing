No doubt, the disorterly bands\nof Portuguese insurgents are, before now,\ncrushed, dispersed, or driven back into\nSpain, whence they came.

If the\nPortuguese rebels fall back ,as it is to be ex-\npectcd they will, into the Spanish territory\nwe are not sure that the British army will\nnot follow them: for the English are not\napt to be very punctilous on such occasions\n+ even when they ought; much less when they\nought not.\n\n\nit is evident that the British Government\nis determined to investigate when the in\nvaders procured arms, ammunition and sup\n= plies.

The same state of feeling exist\nIII Portugal, perhaps, that Mr..

Next week we\nhope to give something more from this in\nteresting quarter; in the interim we present\nfew speculative opinions elected by a New\nYork Editor upon the subject\n\n\nIt's highly probable, that the appearance\nOF an English force of 5000 men, and pow\nfull squadron will instantly adjust matters\nin Portugal. No doubt, the disorterly bands\nof Portuguese insurgents are, before now,\ncrushed, dispersed, or driven back into\nSpain, whence they came. The stupid Fer\n,linand will stoutly disclam all knowledge\nor assistance. Whether the English will be\nsatisfied with his protestations or excess, is\nanother question. From what Mr. Canning\nsaid about him in his speech, we think it\nlikely that they will subject him TO a strict\nand very summary examination. If the\nPortuguese rebels fall back ,as it is to be ex-\npectcd they will, into the Spanish territory\nwe are not sure that the British army will\nnot follow them: for the English are not\napt to be very punctilous on such occasions\n+ even when they ought; much less when they\nought not.\n\n\nit is evident that the British Government\nis determined to investigate when the in\nvaders procured arms, ammunition and sup\n= plies. Whether they will succeed in their\n\n\n\n\n\nfound, however upon examination, that thai\nnotorious meddler with human affairs, no\n: BODY, did it. Whether Ferdinand will no\n/, be punished for permitting nobody to do it\nis a different question again. 1t is imposs\n\n\nBILE to foresce what the lion may not do\nwhen he pounces on the jackall.\n\n\nIn our opinion the British armament ant\nJ. expedition to Portugal will only result in ar\n= occupation of that c9untry by the English\n\n\nThe duration of possession will be dctcrmin\ned by circumstances. The Portuguese consti\n: tuition was obtained by means, which not evel\n\n\nthe \"Holy Allies\" themselves can object to\n\n\nfor it is after the plan which they devised\n\n\nTo he sure, they adopted the rule, thinkin!\nthat no Sovereign would grant charter II\nhis subjects but they have been deceived\n\n\nand it is too late to retract.-Whatever in\n\n\nfuence they can secretly exert against it\n\n\nthey will. The same state of feeling exist\nIII Portugal, perhaps, that Mr.. Canning al\n\n\nlots to Spain; that the vast majority OF thu\n\n\npeople are devoted to absolute monarchy\n=. and opposed to free institutions. But wha\n\n\nmatters the majority of the people! Hav\n+ not the Holy\" monarchs declared, that th\nII people have nothing to say on the subject\nG This costitution has been granted 'legitim\n\n\nately by,\" by the legitimate Don Pedro; am\n\n\n\n\n\ny free, in spite of themselves.\n\n\nC These thoughts, no doubt, occurred to tn\nL. British Cabinet and finding that \"cordo\nd sanitaire,\" composed of the same relativ\nmaterials (refugees) as its prototype a\nVI the Pyrenees, was gathering on the frontier\nOF of Portugal, they determined that the sam\nre ruthless gau,e should not be repeated, an\n,r that constitutional liberty should not be hun\nr ed and eut-lawed on the continent OF Europ.\noi We make no sort of doubt, that there woul\n\n\nhave been a revolution in Portugal, nut te\nIN their interference.\n\n\nm Whether the \"koy\" abettors OF this VIZ\n=, gitmate\" rebellion will persist and thro\ny aside the mask and cloak for more emerge\n1t, ic efforts, we will not venture to predict. o'\na. we think that they will not. single gro'\nn of the mastiff will bring them to stand.\n- We cannot persuade ourselves that tn\n\n\nis the unpromoted and unassisted act\n\n\nSpain; although, perhaps, Ferdinand al\n=, the absolutsts' fierce, but impotent hatrt\n~ of free dom, might be sufficient to account\nae it.
