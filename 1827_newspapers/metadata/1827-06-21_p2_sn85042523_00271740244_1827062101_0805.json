Sprague's Address before the society\nfcr the suppression of intemperance, on\nThursday evening. attracted a crowded au-\ndience, and was heard with profound attcn-\ntion. 1t was powerful appeal to the pat\nriot, the philanthropist, and the Christian.\n20 unite in the determination of the vice OF\nintemperance. The appalling spectacles OF\nman falling away from his glorious destiny.\nand woman sinking from her angel character\nOf tae young bowing their faces in the oeau-\n~ of their promise, and the grey headed\nseeking the tomb in disgrace, we're present\ned in warm and glowing colours. and the du-\n~ OF exerton to arrest the progress OF the\ndestroyer--by example as well as by pre-\ncept-was enforced in strong and vigorous\nlanguage. The power of example, Mr.\nSprague contended, was the power on which\nthe society must chiefly rely for success in\ntheir labors; as laws for suppressing dram\nshops and laying heavy duties on imported\nor domestic liquors, could be of little avail,\nSO long as custom authorizes, and renders\nalmost indispensable, the constant use OF ar\ndent spirits, wines and cordials, on all occa-\nsions of hospitality OF festivity. The revolt\ning portraits he sketched of the son, the hus-\nband, and the wife, given over to the om-\nnipotent despotism of strong drink, It is fear\ned, are not the creation of a poetical ina\ngination, but the two faithful pictures OF\npainful and frequent realities. He traced\nthe all-pervading propensity to dangerous\nindulgence through all classes OF society\nfrom the rich, who boast Of their wine that\nhas been rocked upon the ocean and rlpen-\ned beneath an Indian sun, to the miserable\ntenants of the hovel, who will have rum,\nthough their children famsh for lack OF\nbread; and urged to the necessity of com\nmencing the reformation so much desired\namong the rich and fashionable.\n\n\nAfter touching upon many OF the evils ot\niitemperance. as they affect man in the life\nthat is, the orator alluded to the unspedkable\nImportance they assumed, when man was\nconsidered as a being born to live forever\nTime would cool the hot blood of youth. and\nPhilosophy might take the reigns that pas\nsion resigned, but the vampire lntenper.\nance would cling closer as it drew Its cap\ntive nearer to the grave. Is it not wonder\nfull, Che sad) that a creature glowing wits\nthe divinity of his Creator-cndowea with\nenergies TO control the things Of one world,\nand with attributes that capacitate him Tor\nthe joys of another--abe to bind to his will\nthe elements that surround him, making\nthe winds and the waters the ministers OF\nhis pleasure--riffling the caverns OF the\nearth of their unsunned MISUNDERSTANDING\n\n\n\nplaces-exploring TIL unbounaed realms OF\ncreation till he stands in speechleSs\nhomage at the footstool of creations awful\nFounder---is it not indeed wonderful, that\nsuch a being, so rarely endowed, should\ndare to quench the sacred fire that has de\nscended upon him--cumberng the earth he\nwas born to subdue, and torfeitlns the Hea-\nven he was ordained 70 enjoyt\n\n\nThe orator adiured the clergy, the anont-\ned ministers Of Christ, who enjoyed the prl-\nvilege and had the command to speak Il\nmen of their immortal destiny, TO aid II\nthe work Of reformation. fit were impor\nsant Che said) TO make men beGere right\nwas it not still more important to max,\nthem do right. If it were their duty as min\nlisters to point the way to Heaven, was It no\ntheir duty, to fit men for Heavens enjoy\nments. They could sharpen and burnisl\ntheir weapons, and set themselves IN aTa'\nagainst each other, in defence of their yari\nGus and contradictory creeds. and why coulc\nthey not unite their powers to overthrow\nthe giant sin that wars with every creed.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Mr.. Sprague cxhorted til\nSociety to persevere in their honorable la\nbors, not suffering themselves to be dishcart\nened because they could not accomplish al\nthey wished. All human efforts The said\nhowever laudable, must be marked by i'm\nperfection. Thar is the badge of earth an\nall that is earthly. 1t is hung round th\nneck Of man, before his first repose on hi\nmothers lap, and it remains there till hi\nlast sleep on the lap of the common mothe\nof all. 1t is impossible entirely to root ou\ndrunkenness--but it may be made so rare\n\n\ncrime, that the guilty ones shall stand OF\nlike dark pillars on the road of life, to remin\nthe innocent how far they have left then be\nhind. Go on, then, as YOU have begun. tn\nhealth and happiness of individuals, ii\ncomfort of families, the welfare Of societ\ncall upon you. The fiery serpents of il\ntemperance are abroad in the land, let yol\nexample be the symbol OF healing, which III\nafflicted may look up to and live. What !\nsay and do, others will initiate.

II such, after the use OF prop\ner means, cannot be reclaimed, the peace\nand harmony, and welfare Of the body re-\nqu're that ;hey should be separated from our\ncommunion.\n\n\nThe Apostle, aware Of the evils arising\nfrom Contention in religious communities,\nwarned his brethren against it, declaring that\n\"where envying and strife is, there is ceniu-\nsion and every evil work.\" aud they were\nexhorted to withdraw from every brother\nwho walked Slisorderly. And we know from\nexperience, that wherever this evil spirit\nhas appeared in any Of our meetings, weak\nness and jealousy, and divisions have been\nintroGuced; and that excellent order has\nbeen sunverted which has not only preserv-\ned us in love and concord, but protected the\nrights and privileges Of all our Members.\n\n\nWith deep concern and sorrow, we have\nobserved the introduction and increase ofthi.\ndesolatne spirit.

Sprague's Address before the society\nfcr the suppression of intemperance, on\nThursday evening. attracted a crowded au-\ndience, and was heard with profound attcn-\ntion. 1t was powerful appeal to the pat\nriot, the philanthropist, and the Christian.\n20 unite in the determination of the vice OF\nintemperance. The appalling spectacles OF\nman falling away from his glorious destiny.\nand woman sinking from her angel character\nOf tae young bowing their faces in the oeau-\n~ of their promise, and the grey headed\nseeking the tomb in disgrace, we're present\ned in warm and glowing colours. and the du-\n~ OF exerton to arrest the progress OF the\ndestroyer--by example as well as by pre-\ncept-was enforced in strong and vigorous\nlanguage. The power of example, Mr.\nSprague contended, was the power on which\nthe society must chiefly rely for success in\ntheir labors; as laws for suppressing dram\nshops and laying heavy duties on imported\nor domestic liquors, could be of little avail,\nSO long as custom authorizes, and renders\nalmost indispensable, the constant use OF ar\ndent spirits, wines and cordials, on all occa-\nsions of hospitality OF festivity. The revolt\ning portraits he sketched of the son, the hus-\nband, and the wife, given over to the om-\nnipotent despotism of strong drink, It is fear\ned, are not the creation of a poetical ina\ngination, but the two faithful pictures OF\npainful and frequent realities. He traced\nthe all-pervading propensity to dangerous\nindulgence through all classes OF society\nfrom the rich, who boast Of their wine that\nhas been rocked upon the ocean and rlpen-\ned beneath an Indian sun, to the miserable\ntenants of the hovel, who will have rum,\nthough their children famsh for lack OF\nbread; and urged to the necessity of com\nmencing the reformation so much desired\namong the rich and fashionable.\n\n\nAfter touching upon many OF the evils ot\niitemperance. as they affect man in the life\nthat is, the orator alluded to the unspedkable\nImportance they assumed, when man was\nconsidered as a being born to live forever\nTime would cool the hot blood of youth. and\nPhilosophy might take the reigns that pas\nsion resigned, but the vampire lntenper.\nance would cling closer as it drew Its cap\ntive nearer to the grave. Is it not wonder\nfull, Che sad) that a creature glowing wits\nthe divinity of his Creator-cndowea with\nenergies TO control the things Of one world,\nand with attributes that capacitate him Tor\nthe joys of another--abe to bind to his will\nthe elements that surround him, making\nthe winds and the waters the ministers OF\nhis pleasure--riffling the caverns OF the\nearth of their unsunned MISUNDERSTANDING\n\n\n\nplaces-exploring TIL unbounaed realms OF\ncreation till he stands in speechleSs\nhomage at the footstool of creations awful\nFounder---is it not indeed wonderful, that\nsuch a being, so rarely endowed, should\ndare to quench the sacred fire that has de\nscended upon him--cumberng the earth he\nwas born to subdue, and torfeitlns the Hea-\nven he was ordained 70 enjoyt\n\n\nThe orator adiured the clergy, the anont-\ned ministers Of Christ, who enjoyed the prl-\nvilege and had the command to speak Il\nmen of their immortal destiny, TO aid II\nthe work Of reformation. fit were impor\nsant Che said) TO make men beGere right\nwas it not still more important to max,\nthem do right. If it were their duty as min\nlisters to point the way to Heaven, was It no\ntheir duty, to fit men for Heavens enjoy\nments. They could sharpen and burnisl\ntheir weapons, and set themselves IN aTa'\nagainst each other, in defence of their yari\nGus and contradictory creeds. and why coulc\nthey not unite their powers to overthrow\nthe giant sin that wars with every creed.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Mr.. Sprague cxhorted til\nSociety to persevere in their honorable la\nbors, not suffering themselves to be dishcart\nened because they could not accomplish al\nthey wished. All human efforts The said\nhowever laudable, must be marked by i'm\nperfection. Thar is the badge of earth an\nall that is earthly. 1t is hung round th\nneck Of man, before his first repose on hi\nmothers lap, and it remains there till hi\nlast sleep on the lap of the common mothe\nof all. 1t is impossible entirely to root ou\ndrunkenness--but it may be made so rare\n\n\ncrime, that the guilty ones shall stand OF\nlike dark pillars on the road of life, to remin\nthe innocent how far they have left then be\nhind. Go on, then, as YOU have begun. tn\nhealth and happiness of individuals, ii\ncomfort of families, the welfare Of societ\ncall upon you. The fiery serpents of il\ntemperance are abroad in the land, let yol\nexample be the symbol OF healing, which III\nafflicted may look up to and live. What !\nsay and do, others will initiate. Alread\nthere is rustling among the leaves Of II\nforest, and it foretells the rising wind tn;\nshali come in its parity to cleanse the sufft\neating atmosphere.
