Little accompanied this report with few verbal explanations, stating that the committee proposed to establish the ratio of representation at one member to 1000 inhabitants. This rate it was believed by the committee, would continue in the House about the present number of mem bers, which number it was not wished to increase. These remarks, however, were intended chiefly to draw the attention of the House to the subject general ly-every gentleman would of course, be able to make the calculation for himself.\n\n The bill was twice read, and madethe order of the day for tomorrow.\n\n Friday, Jan. 5.\n\n The House was again engaged on the bill to provide for the surviving officers of the army of the revolution, which was act- ed on in Committee of the Whole. The amendatory bill, reported by Mir. Burges, and moved by him as an amendment was re- jected; and the old bill, which embraces both officers and soldiers, passed through the committee, and was reported to the House with blanks filled. The amend ment as now proposed covers every branch of the army. It in the first place provi- des for the distribution of$8OO,OOO among the oficers,an then gives $2OO,OOO to the widows of the deceased officers. To the officers and soldiers who are not provided for by this provision, it appropriates 1,20- O,OOO: and to the widows of those who are deceased of this last class, it gives SS- OO,OOO. It embraces all classes, as we'll as those who served from 1782 to the end ofthe war. It ought, therefore, to satisfy all. The Journal of Saturday says-this he fate ofthe bill will probably be decided, IS there appears to be a very proper dispo- aition on the part of the House not to waste sine in the discussion of a bill on which eve- ry member must have made up his mind long since.",

Our limits will not admit the mass of intelligence found in the New fork papers. We have given his Majesty's message upon the subject, and as much as possible of the speech of Mir. Secretary Canning. Different constructions are put upon this intelligence. Some have supposed that this step will lead to universal war in Europe; others quote Mir. Canning's rsmarks, as implying all that will be affected by this commencement of hos tilities, '' that this is war-not against Spain, but in defence of POrtugal,-not of aggression, but of repressi\"n.\"-Ifthis ground is adhered to,-which is not generally the case when nations commence deadly strife,-there can be no ground for alarms as regards the peace of the civilized world. But should new cau- ses of disaffection grow out this beginning of strife-should new reasons be adduced for con- tinuing war already began,-then there is reason to anticipate that not only the peace of Europe, but even of this country is at stake.- The Spanish island of Cuba would be prize invaluable to England; and the only possible prize which can compensate the British gov ernment for the expense of war with Spain; but our government will never admit that important post to fall into the possession of England, to be held by her upon the tenure of her other w. I. possessions, without enter ing protest of force and arms. This is the universal opinion throughout the country, and it is an opinion which will warrant our gov ernment to act decisively upon the subiect.- The London papers, however, ofdiffercnt pol itics, all seem to agree in the opinion that the war will be of short duration, and that no con- quests will grow out oft. It is difficult to say which party appears most in favor of the war, the ministerial, or the opposition; but one sen- timent prevails in England, and that is senti- ment of appreciation of the Course pursued by the ministers.\n\n House of Lords, Dec.

Greece is country of mountains. The plains are few, and chiefly on the frontier. A mighty parallel of mountains closes it on the north running from sea to sea. From this ridge shoots off to the south, penetrating the entire of Greece down to the Mediterranean, where it ends in the Tanarian promontory, dividing in its way the Eastern from Western Hell las, and filling the region on both sides with perpetual branches of hills. Four rivers rise from the chain of Pindus, that great central elevation from which the southern ridge is projeted-the Aracthus, flowing south west, into the gulf of Arta--the Achelaus, flowing south among the mountains, and entering the sea near the memorable site of Missolonghi- the Peneus, tor Salympria,) flowing east\n\n \n\n to the Archipelago through the defles of Tempe-and the Aous, (Viosa) flowing north east to Tepeleni, and entering the Adri- atic very near the site of the ancient Appel lonia.\n\n The divisions adopted by the late and pres ent governments are important for understan ding the narrative of the war. The Turks governed by four chief Paschas. The pa shalik of Tripolizza included the Morea. The pashalk of Negropont included that island (Eubea) with Bpotia and the eastern district of Phocis. The pashiIik of Salonica included the southern portion of Macedonia. The pa shilik of Joannina included Epirus, Thessaly, and portion of Livadia. Athens, Livadia, and Larissa, had each it's own separate gover- nor. s...\n\n The first impulse of the Greek war origina- ted Tn the French Revolution. That great explosion, which for its time kept mankind in terror, was perhaps designed to be mighty agent of good as well as of evil; it has al- ready broken off the New World from Spain and may be at this hour renovating the ex- haulsted soil of the Old. During the Revolu- tion, commerce had unexpectedly fallen into the hands of the Greek islanders, and with it comparative opulence. The general excite ment of the European mind had reached c. ven to the vassals of the Turk, and spirit of education and improvement had combined with a sense of their wrongs, and hope of their ultimate liberation among the fortunate consequences of time of change. Greece had also assumed sudden interest with the great belligerents French agents had been despatched through the country. Russian agents had been sent to cOunteract them.- Greek students. traders, and military men, had occasionally returned, animated by the know ledge, the wealth, or the distinctions of Flu rope. The great Turkish ship still floated heavily upon the waters, without anchor or sail, but the clouds were gathering, and the storm was to come.\n\n FORET(rN TNIVET TTCENTE",

The amendatory bill, reported by Mir. Burges, and moved by him as an amendment was re- jected; and the old bill, which embraces both officers and soldiers, passed through the committee, and was reported to the House with blanks filled. The amend ment as now proposed covers every branch of the army. It in the first place provi- des for the distribution of$8OO,OOO among the oficers,an then gives $2OO,OOO to the widows of the deceased officers. To the officers and soldiers who are not provided for by this provision, it appropriates 1,20- O,OOO: and to the widows of those who are deceased of this last class, it gives SS- OO,OOO. It embraces all classes, as we'll as those who served from 1782 to the end ofthe war. It ought, therefore, to satisfy all.

            "article": "A late arrival at New York brings the inn portant intelligence that Portugal, having been invaded by Spain, had called upon the Brit lsh government for that assistance which trea- ties of alliance had engaged on the part of Eng land. Our limits will not admit the mass of intelligence found in the New fork papers. We have given his Majesty's message upon the subject, and as much as possible of the speech of Mir. Secretary Canning. Different constructions are put upon this intelligence. Some have supposed that this step will lead to universal war in Europe; others quote Mir. Canning's rsmarks, as implying all that will be affected by this commencement of hos tilities, '' that this is war-not against Spain, but in defence of POrtugal,-not of aggression, but of repressi\"n.\"-Ifthis ground is adhered to,-which is not generally the case when nations commence deadly strife,-there can be no ground for alarms as regards the peace of the civilized world. But should new cau- ses of disaffection grow out this beginning of strife-should new reasons be adduced for con- tinuing war already began,-then there is reason to anticipate that not only the peace of Europe, but even of this country is at stake.- The Spanish island of Cuba would be prize invaluable to England; and the only possible prize which can compensate the British gov ernment for the expense of war with Spain; but our government will never admit that important post to fall into the possession of England, to be held by her upon the tenure of her other w. I. possessions, without enter ing protest of force and arms. This is the universal opinion throughout the country, and it is an opinion which will warrant our gov ernment to act decisively upon the subiect.- The London papers, however, ofdiffercnt pol itics, all seem to agree in the opinion that the war will be of short duration, and that no con- quests will grow out oft. It is difficult to say which party appears most in favor of the war, the ministerial, or the opposition; but one sen- timent prevails in England, and that is senti- ment of appreciation of the Course pursued by the ministers.\n\n House of Lords, Dec. II.\n\n Message from His Majesty.-Earl Bathurst informed the House that he had to deliver Message from his Majesty. ...\n\n The Message having been handed to the Lord Chancellor, the Noble and learned Lord read as follows\n\n GEORGER.\n\n His Majesty acquaints the House of Lords, that his Majesty has received an earnest ap- plication from the Princess Regent of Portu- gal, claiming, in virtue of the ancient obliga- tlons of alliance and amity subsisting between his Majesty and the Crown of Portugal, his Majesty's aid against an hostile aggression from Spain.\n\n His Majesty has exerted himself for some tune past, in conjunction with his Majesty's ally, the King of France. to prevent such an aggression; and repeated assurances have been given by the Court of Madrid, of the de- termination of his Catholic Majesty neither to commit, nor to allow to be committed, from ms Catholic Majesty's territory, any aggres- sion against Portugal:\n\n But his Majesty has learnt with deep con",

Greece is country of mountains. The plains are few, and chiefly on the frontier. A mighty parallel of mountains closes it on the north running from sea to sea. From this ridge shoots off to the south, penetrating the entire of Greece down to the Mediterranean, where it ends in the Tanarian promontory, dividing in its way the Eastern from Western Hell las, and filling the region on both sides with perpetual branches of hills. Four rivers rise from the chain of Pindus, that great central elevation from which the southern ridge is projeted-the Aracthus, flowing south west, into the gulf of Arta--the Achelaus, flowing south among the mountains, and entering the sea near the memorable site of Missolonghi- the Peneus, tor Salympria,) flowing east\n\n \n\n to the Archipelago through the defles of Tempe-and the Aous, (Viosa) flowing north east to Tepeleni, and entering the Adri- atic very near the site of the ancient Appel lonia.\n\n The divisions adopted by the late and pres ent governments are important for understan ding the narrative of the war. The Turks governed by four chief Paschas. The pa shalik of Tripolizza included the Morea. The pashalk of Negropont included that island (Eubea) with Bpotia and the eastern district of Phocis. The pashiIik of Salonica included the southern portion of Macedonia. The pa shilik of Joannina included Epirus, Thessaly, and portion of Livadia. Athens, Livadia, and Larissa, had each it's own separate gover- nor. s...\n\n The first impulse of the Greek war origina- ted Tn the French Revolution. That great explosion, which for its time kept mankind in terror, was perhaps designed to be mighty agent of good as well as of evil; it has al- ready broken off the New World from Spain and may be at this hour renovating the ex- haulsted soil of the Old. During the Revolu- tion, commerce had unexpectedly fallen into the hands of the Greek islanders, and with it comparative opulence. The general excite ment of the European mind had reached c. ven to the vassals of the Turk, and spirit of education and improvement had combined with a sense of their wrongs, and hope of their ultimate liberation among the fortunate consequences of time of change. Greece had also assumed sudden interest with the great belligerents French agents had been despatched through the country. Russian agents had been sent to cOunteract them.- Greek students. traders, and military men, had occasionally returned, animated by the know ledge, the wealth, or the distinctions of Flu rope. The great Turkish ship still floated heavily upon the waters, without anchor or sail, but the clouds were gathering, and the storm was to come.\n\n FORET(rN TNIVET TTCENTE",

The other was to make the possession of that country harmless in rival hands-to make it worse than harm less, to make it injurious to the possessor. The latter mode have adopted.
