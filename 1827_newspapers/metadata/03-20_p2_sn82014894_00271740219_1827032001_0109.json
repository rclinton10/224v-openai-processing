You are at liberty to state to the councils\nbefore whom you represent the interests and rights\nOf this State, what has been repeatedly represent\ned to the President himself, that the Governor OF\nGeorgia has never, at any time, entertained the\nidea of resorting to military force to counteract\nmeasures of the Government of the United States,\nbut on the occasion where it was deemed better\nin honor, in conscience, and in duty, to sacrifice\nevery thing we hold dear, than unresistngly tol\nsubmit. On the last occasion, when military co.\nercion was threatened, the President was promptly\nand candidly informed of my resolution to meet\nthat coercion in military manner. So far as\ndetermination expressed to resort to the civil\nprocess, it was decided to resort to the like pro-\ncess 10 sustain, according to the Constitution and\nlaws of the United States and the Constitution\nand laws Of the State, the public officers OF Geor-\ngia engaged in the execution Of their duties under\nthe orders directly Of its Legislative and Execu-\ntive authorities-an obligation, on part enjoin\ned By the very sanction which the President, in\nhis late message, refers to- as being paramount to\nany human power, and of course, equally impera-\ntive with US as with him. cannot acknowledge\na power in the United States TO bring before its\nJudicial Tribunals for trial, and judgment, and\npunishment, the Governor, or Judges, or Repre-.\nsentatiyes, or other Ohicers such, acting under\nthe authority of the Constitution and laws of the\nStates. Whilst, therefore. no intention exists to\nresist the Civil Authority Of the United States con-\nslider myself bound to afford to Officers of Georgia\nacting under my orders, all the protection can,\nconsistently with the Constitution aud laws and\ncan never admit that wrongs done by Officers oI\nthe United States to Officers Of the State, shall\nnot be inquired into and redresscd by the State\nTribunals.\n\n\n| consider all questions of mere sovereignty as\nmatter for negotiation between the States and\nUnited States. until the competent Tribunal shall\nbe assigned by the Constitution itself for the ad-\njustment Of them.\n\n\nl. am not wanting in confidence in the Supreme\nCourt Of the United States in all cases falling\nwithin their acknowledged jurisdiction. AS men,\nwould not hesitate to refer our cause to their ar.\nbtration or umpirage. On an amcable issue made\nup between the United States and ourselves, we\nmight have had difficulty in referring it to them\nas Judges, protesting, at the time, against the\njurisdiction. and saving rights of sovereignty\nII the United States will with without the con-\nsent Of Georgia, make question before the Su-\npreme Court. it will be for the Government of\nGeorgia ultimately to submit, or not to the deci-\nsion of that Tribunal But, according to my lin\ntied conception, the Supreme Court is not made.\nbv The Constitution Of the United States, the ar.\nsiter in controversies involving rights of sovereign.\nty between the States and the United States The\nSenate of the United States may have so consid.\ncred IT. because it has been proposed to make that\nhonorable body itself the arbiter and umpire be-\ntween them The States cannot consent to refer\nto the Supreme Court as of right and obligation,\nquestions OF sovereignty between them and the\nUnited States. because that Court, being Of exclu-\nsve appointment by the Government Of the Uni\nted States, will make the United States the Judge\nIN their own cause this reason is equally appca-\nble to State Tribunal. Hence, the difficulties\nlkely oarise even by resort to the civil process,\nand thus you wiperceive how infinitely preferable\nit is to carry into effect Immediately the measure\ncontemplated by the Instructions to the Agent.\n\n\n1t is indeed to be lamented, that person so well\nknown here for his unftness should have been char\nged with such an office. but this very knowledge\nwill make the failure, if the failure happen, not our\nfault, but the fault of his employers.\n\n\nOt all the wrongs wantonly and cruelty inflicted\nnone have been borne with more patience than the\ncharge Of seeking dissolution of the Union. Nv\nintentions have been to cement and perpetuate il.\nBY preserving, inyiolate the rights Of the parties\nto the compact, without which, the compact would\nbe Of no value, and to this end have Increasingly\n\n\nabored Time may probably disclose, that a very",

            "article": "ExEcuT,yE DEPARTMENT, GEoReIA,2\n\n\n.uilledrerille 21st Feb. 1897.\n\n\nGENTLEMEN: was glad to learn by the mail\nof today. that measures had been taken by the\nPresident, subsequently to the communication OF\nthe Secretary of War, of the 29th ut., 70 procure\nthe lands left out by the instrument called the\nNew Treaty. have uniformly urged TINS mea\nsure on the General Government, from the moment\nIl professed willingness, contlngently, to adopt\nit. and in no part of the correspondence more\nstrenuously than in my letter to the Secretary OF\nWar, of the Goth January, copy OF which was\ntransmitted to you by the last mail. 1t was known\nto me, that sincere desire to procure them, ac-\ncompanied BY corresponding efforts, could not fail\nof success, and had felt both surprise and regret\nthat any reluctance had been manifested to have\nrecourse to the necessary measure without ueiay.\nThe reasons assigned for the postponement were,\nin no aspect of them, satsfactory and so the Pre-\nsident was informed in candid and amicable spi-\nrit. You are at liberty to state to the councils\nbefore whom you represent the interests and rights\nOf this State, what has been repeatedly represent\ned to the President himself, that the Governor OF\nGeorgia has never, at any time, entertained the\nidea of resorting to military force to counteract\nmeasures of the Government of the United States,\nbut on the occasion where it was deemed better\nin honor, in conscience, and in duty, to sacrifice\nevery thing we hold dear, than unresistngly tol\nsubmit. On the last occasion, when military co.\nercion was threatened, the President was promptly\nand candidly informed of my resolution to meet\nthat coercion in military manner. So far as\ndetermination expressed to resort to the civil\nprocess, it was decided to resort to the like pro-\ncess 10 sustain, according to the Constitution and\nlaws of the United States and the Constitution\nand laws Of the State, the public officers OF Geor-\ngia engaged in the execution Of their duties under\nthe orders directly Of its Legislative and Execu-\ntive authorities-an obligation, on part enjoin\ned By the very sanction which the President, in\nhis late message, refers to- as being paramount to\nany human power, and of course, equally impera-\ntive with US as with him. cannot acknowledge\na power in the United States TO bring before its\nJudicial Tribunals for trial, and judgment, and\npunishment, the Governor, or Judges, or Repre-.\nsentatiyes, or other Ohicers such, acting under\nthe authority of the Constitution and laws of the\nStates. Whilst, therefore. no intention exists to\nresist the Civil Authority Of the United States con-\nslider myself bound to afford to Officers of Georgia\nacting under my orders, all the protection can,\nconsistently with the Constitution aud laws and\ncan never admit that wrongs done by Officers oI\nthe United States to Officers Of the State, shall\nnot be inquired into and redresscd by the State\nTribunals.\n\n\n| consider all questions of mere sovereignty as\nmatter for negotiation between the States and\nUnited States. until the competent Tribunal shall\nbe assigned by the Constitution itself for the ad-\njustment Of them.\n\n\nl. am not wanting in confidence in the Supreme\nCourt Of the United States in all cases falling\nwithin their acknowledged jurisdiction. AS men,\nwould not hesitate to refer our cause to their ar.\nbtration or umpirage. On an amcable issue made\nup between the United States and ourselves, we\nmight have had difficulty in referring it to them\nas Judges, protesting, at the time, against the\njurisdiction. and saving rights of sovereignty\nII the United States will with without the con-\nsent Of Georgia, make question before the Su-\npreme Court. it will be for the Government of\nGeorgia ultimately to submit, or not to the deci-\nsion of that Tribunal But, according to my lin\ntied conception, the Supreme Court is not made.\nbv The Constitution Of the United States, the ar.\nsiter in controversies involving rights of sovereign.\nty between the States and the United States The\nSenate of the United States may have so consid.\ncred IT. because it has been proposed to make that\nhonorable body itself the arbiter and umpire be-\ntween them The States cannot consent to refer\nto the Supreme Court as of right and obligation,\nquestions OF sovereignty between them and the\nUnited States. because that Court, being Of exclu-\nsve appointment by the Government Of the Uni\nted States, will make the United States the Judge\nIN their own cause this reason is equally appca-\nble to State Tribunal. Hence, the difficulties\nlkely oarise even by resort to the civil process,\nand thus you wiperceive how infinitely preferable\nit is to carry into effect Immediately the measure\ncontemplated by the Instructions to the Agent.\n\n\n1t is indeed to be lamented, that person so well\nknown here for his unftness should have been char\nged with such an office. but this very knowledge\nwill make the failure, if the failure happen, not our\nfault, but the fault of his employers.\n\n\nOt all the wrongs wantonly and cruelty inflicted\nnone have been borne with more patience than the\ncharge Of seeking dissolution of the Union. Nv\nintentions have been to cement and perpetuate il.\nBY preserving, inyiolate the rights Of the parties\nto the compact, without which, the compact would\nbe Of no value, and to this end have Increasingly\n\n\nabored Time may probably disclose, that a very",
