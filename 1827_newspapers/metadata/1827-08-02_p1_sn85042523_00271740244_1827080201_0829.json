            "raw_text": "The climate Of Cuba is remarkably fine\nand salubrious for a considerable part of the\nwear; say from the month of October to the\nfirst of June. During this period the ther-\nmometer ranges from 70 to 80 degrees Far.\nand for the remaining part of the year is a\nlittle above 80, though rarely so high as 90,\n1t will be seen by this that it is not subject\nto those severe and sudden changes which\noccur in our own country, and which are so\nextremely fatal in the production of pulmo..\nnary complaints. The subject of the climate\nof the city of Havanns. is but little under\nstood IN the United States. The locality of\nthe city is certainly as favorable tor health\nas most cities of equal magnitude in the u\nnited States. For the two years previous to\nthe 3Ist December, 1926, there was no yell\nlow fever there, although the rainy season\nmust be productive of much filth in the\nstreets as they are during the winter season\nvery dusty, and little or no pains are taken\nto remove this dust. Several American\nphysicians of good reputation are established\nat Havana. DR.. -, the eldest of these,\ninformed me that during his practice he had\nlost Of the fever, about one tenth of his pa\ntients; that he imputed good deal of the\nunhealthiness to the regularity of the trade\nwinds from the north east. Since the time\nthe fever had ceased, the winds had been\nvariable; that he could judge from this\nand from the appearance of the water in\nthe bay, what the state of health would be\nby anticipation. On such occasions the wa\nter had muddy appearance, and, he add.\ned, \"whitsh.\" Dr.. c.. another physician\nOf equally good standing, mentioned that dur\ning the last fever, he had, out of 1913 pa\ntients, lost Is. This, it will be seen, is more\nthan the proportion mentioned by the first\nstatement: but the first was general. without\nreference to any particular year. Both add\ned that when death cnsued, in most instan-\nces they had not been called IN season; nor\nuntil the very last stages of the disorder. IN\nthese cases too, the patients were generally\nsailors of foreign nations. However favor\"\nable this statement may be, II must not DC\nforgotten that eMigrants from all parts OF\nEurope. not excepting Spain, are subject to\ni. the first wear. One young American told\nme that during a residence of seven years\nat Havana and Matanzas, he had it three\ntimes. Few, after all, of mankind will be\nwilling TO take the chance of life and death,\neven of one in ten. Although it must be\nadmitted that many die from indulging in\nhabits contracted previously to their resi-\ndeuce in Cuba; and from the sudden change\nof diet and custom. 1t might be well tor\npeople on that account, to locate themselves\nin such public houses as would be found to\ncorrespond most with their previous habits\nand manners, particularly during their early\nresidence in Cuba.\n\n\nThe Island, from its peculiar sslubrity\nduring the season from November to May,\nof course offers great inducements to persons\nafflicted with pulmonary complaints. Hence\nit is visited great deal on this account\nThe country is generally preferred to The\ncities, and numbers of invalids are found on\nthe plantations in various parts Of the !slard",

During this period the ther-\nmometer ranges from 70 to 80 degrees Far.\nand for the remaining part of the year is a\nlittle above 80, though rarely so high as 90,\n1t will be seen by this that it is not subject\nto those severe and sudden changes which\noccur in our own country, and which are so\nextremely fatal in the production of pulmo..\nnary complaints. The subject of the climate\nof the city of Havanns. is but little under\nstood IN the United States. The locality of\nthe city is certainly as favorable tor health\nas most cities of equal magnitude in the u\nnited States. For the two years previous to\nthe 3Ist December, 1926, there was no yell\nlow fever there, although the rainy season\nmust be productive of much filth in the\nstreets as they are during the winter season\nvery dusty, and little or no pains are taken\nto remove this dust. Several American\nphysicians of good reputation are established\nat Havana. DR.. -, the eldest of these,\ninformed me that during his practice he had\nlost Of the fever, about one tenth of his pa\ntients; that he imputed good deal of the\nunhealthiness to the regularity of the trade\nwinds from the north east. Since the time\nthe fever had ceased, the winds had been\nvariable; that he could judge from this\nand from the appearance of the water in\nthe bay, what the state of health would be\nby anticipation. On such occasions the wa\nter had muddy appearance, and, he add.\ned, \"whitsh.\" Dr.. c.. another physician\nOf equally good standing, mentioned that dur\ning the last fever, he had, out of 1913 pa\ntients, lost Is. This, it will be seen, is more\nthan the proportion mentioned by the first\nstatement: but the first was general. without\nreference to any particular year. Both add\ned that when death cnsued, in most instan-\nces they had not been called IN season; nor\nuntil the very last stages of the disorder. IN\nthese cases too, the patients were generally\nsailors of foreign nations. However favor\"\nable this statement may be, II must not DC\nforgotten that eMigrants from all parts OF\nEurope. not excepting Spain, are subject to\ni. the first wear. One young American told\nme that during a residence of seven years\nat Havana and Matanzas, he had it three\ntimes. Few, after all, of mankind will be\nwilling TO take the chance of life and death,\neven of one in ten. Although it must be\nadmitted that many die from indulging in\nhabits contracted previously to their resi-\ndeuce in Cuba; and from the sudden change\nof diet and custom. 1t might be well tor\npeople on that account, to locate themselves\nin such public houses as would be found to\ncorrespond most with their previous habits\nand manners, particularly during their early\nresidence in Cuba.\n\n\nThe Island, from its peculiar sslubrity\nduring the season from November to May,\nof course offers great inducements to persons\nafflicted with pulmonary complaints. Hence\nit is visited great deal on this account\nThe country is generally preferred to The\ncities, and numbers of invalids are found on\nthe plantations in various parts Of the !slard",

The rustic choir endcav-\nored to \"snatch grace beyond the reach of\nart\" but some of their tongues seemed to\ntceave to the roofs of their mouths; the rec\ntors sermon was the best he could pick out\nfrom his bundle Of ffty-two, or thereabouts,\nwhich bundle having served for one year,\nwas then turned round and served mighti-\nly well for the next also; his auditors. sim\n! pie souls never suspecting that they were\ngetting the same dose over again.\n\n\nAt this church, the custom was to dismiss\nthe congregation with psalm, or portion\nos one; and the clerk (who was a celebrat-\ned singer Of profane melodies at the Red\nLion atoresaid) generally reserved his best\npiece of psalmody to conclude with; and at\nthe time in question, being determined, like\nall the rest, to immortalize himself as much\nas might be. he looked into the index to the\npsalms, and finding that the ffty-eighth\npsalm began With Speak, 0 We Judges of\nthe earth\" he thought he had hit upon the\nvery thing that would do; and when the rev.\nerend rector had concluded his sermon,\nboldly gave out the first four verses of the\naforesaid psalm, expecting, no doubt, APP\nplause and reward accordingly. The pitch\npipe granted and groaned, the singers growl-\n\"a their stcntorian voices into something\nlike unison, and off they went in grand\nst, le, and sang as follows:\n\n\n\"Spcak, ye Judges Of the earth,\nIf Just your sentence be;\n\n\nOr must not innocence appeal\n\n\nTo heaven from your decree'\n\n\nYour wicked hearts and iudments are\n\n\nAlike by malice swave;\n\n\nYour gripping hands, by weighty bribes,\n\n\nTo violence betrayed.\n\n\nTo virtue, strangers from the womb,\n\n\nTheir infant steps went wrong\n\n\nThey prattle SANDER, and in lies\n\n\nEmployed their lispng tongue.\n\n\nNo scrpe' of pnrched Africa's breed\n\n\nDoth ranker poison bear;\n\n\nThe drowsy adder will soon\n\n\nUnlock his sullen ear\"\n\n\n1t may readily be supposed that the con-\ngregation presently began to find out that\nthe clerks compliment was completely mai\nGhrohoS; as to those who were called, par\nexcellence, the regular singers, they went\non with their work as loud as usual; not be-\ning in the habit oftroubing thel heads about\nthe import of the words they were singing;\nbut those Of the congre cation who some\ntimes helped them in their chanting, and\nwho on this occasion, began as usual, upon\nfinding the tenor (this is not meant for mu-\nsca pun) of the psalm, dropped their voices\none after another, ard left all the glory and\nthe shame to the singing pew. The clerk\ntoo was frightened out of lis wits, or there\nabouts, at what he had done; and doubtless\nexpected some dreadful visitation from the\nstrong arm If the law for his temerity;\nwhile same Of the neighbours were not quite\nsure whether heavy fine would not be\nlain upon the parish for the insult; in short,\nthese four verses Of the fifty-eight psalm had\nthrown complete gloom upon the day\nwhich had seemed to dawn so glori0usly for\nthis little parish.\n\n\nWhen the judges had returned to the\nRed Lion, and were taking lunch TO fortify\ntheir legal stomachs till they should reach\nto dinner, deputation OF \"the pow\ners that be\" waited on them, as well to\nthank them for tre honor done to their\nexplanation tor poor Amen; who felt quite\nunable that day 10 do justice to his baked\nshoulder of mutton and potatoes. However,\nto his infinite comfort, he was assured by\nthe church wardens, On their return, that\nthe Judges had kindly promised not to hang\nhim that time\n\n\n",
