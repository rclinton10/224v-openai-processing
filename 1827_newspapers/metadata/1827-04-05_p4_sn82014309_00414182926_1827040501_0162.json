MT. Jefferson, in letter relating to him, ob- servcs-\"I served with him in the old Con- gress in the years 1775 and l776. He was very able and logical debater in that body steady in the principles of the revolution; al ways at the post of duty much employed in the business of Committees, and particularly was of the Committee of Dr. Franklin, MT. J. Adams and myself for preparing the Decla- ration of Independence\" He was also suc- cessively member of War and Ordnance, of the Treasury board and of the Marine com mittee. During the whole revolutionary strug- gle, he manifested a dauntless spirit as we'll as an ndefatigable zeal.\n\n In 1784 when New Haven was incorpora- ted, he was elected to the office of Mayor of the city, which he held for the remainder ol his life. About the same period, he was as- sociated with another of the Judges of the Superior Court, in the task of revising and digesting the statutes 0f Connecticut, SO as to produce an improved code for the State. This oppressive service was performed with his usual conscientiousness and success. In 1787, he was appointed a delegate to the General Convention to frame the Federal Constitution of the United States. One of his colleagues was the celebrated Oliver Els worth, who held the office of associate judge of the same court, and wLo as he himself de clared had made MT. Sherman his model in his youth. The venerable President Adams\n\n mentions that '' he never saw two men more\n\n alike, except that the late Chief Justice Els worth had the advantage of a liberal educa ton, and somewhat more extensive reading , Both were conspicuous in the Convention fo , the earnestness and usefulness of their coop eration in tho glorious work of that body Sherman wrote series of essays under thu 1 signature of\" Citizen,\" in favor of the con\n\n stitution, which are affirmed to have materi\n\n ally contributed to procure that full majority\n\n by which it was ratified in Connecticut. Wher I it went into operation, he was elected rep resentative in Congress, and though vergins toward his 7Oth year, took deep interest & active part in the proceedings of the new House.\n\n At the expiration of his first term, he was translated to the Senate, among whom he was never found backward, either in debate oI committee service, touching the various impOr- tant subjects which then came under discus sion. Providence, however, allowed him but two years more of a race thus signaized, in public and private, by dispositions and endea- yours which were well adapted to propitiate Divine favour for another life. He died at New-Haven, on the Sd July, 179S, aged sev- enty two. He had been from his youth de- vout christian, and constant reader of the Scriptures. He maintained correspondence, at different times, on abstruse points of the ology and metaphysics, with some of the most erudite and eminent among the New England clergymen.\n\n In person, Roger Sherman was tall his form was erect and well proportioned; his complexion fair, and his countenance manly and agreeable. Though reserved pnd taciturn in soclaintercourse,h he could not be taxed with austerity; nor with want of liberality, though frugal and abstemious. On all occasions his chief objects appeared to be the welfare of his country, and the triumph of justice.",

In his early boyhood he was apprenticed to shoemaker ana ne followed the same trade for some tune after he was twenty one years of age lie recet- ed from nature a vigorous and Inqn'sitlVe mino' the energies of which were net to be repres- s.d even by the drudgery of his mechanical labour. Books happened to be within his reach. such as tended to enlarge and fcrtify the understanding and with them he contrl- we'd, like Dr. Franklin, to gratify his thirst for knowledge, while he performed his work as an apprentice. Before he had reached his ma iority he became even proficient in geOgTa- phy, the mathematics, and the principles of moral science. Politics and the law equally engaged his attention, and in both he rose, as we shall see in the sequel to great emnence the more honorable as it was marked by su- perior usefulness and uniform public virtue. In no stage of his long career did he ever dis play the least desire to conceal the nature of his first calling, nor any pride in his transition to the most digniied pursuits and stations. During the revolutionary war, he W as placed on a committee of Congress to investigate cer- tain army accounts, among which were some relating to contract for the supply of shoes. He told the committee that the charges were exorbitant, which he prove by specifilng the cost of the different materials and the work manship. Perceiving that the minuteness & confidence with which this was done excited some surprise, he informed the committee that he was by trade shoemaker, and was perfectly acquainted with the cost of the arti- cles.\n\n At the decease of his father he was only nineteen years of age, and yet the mainte- nance of mother and a numerous family of brothers and sisters devolved chiefly on him :; charge which he bore with success, owing to his regular industry in the cultivation of the paternal acres and his skill as an artisan. In l743, it was deemed advisable for the family to dispose of their property at Newton. and remove to New Milford, Litchfeld County Connecticut.-There relinquishing his trade as a shoemaker. he commenced at once thu business of country merchant; and opened shop in connection with an elder brother. IT l745, two years after his removal into the colony of Connecticut, he was appointed q surveyor of lands for the county in which he resided-an advancement due to his mathe- nautical studies. Astronomical calculations oi SO early date as the year 1748 have been discovered among his papers. He made them for an Almanac then published in NewYork, which he supplied thus for several consecutive years.\n\n At the age of 28, he married respectable female, who gave him a numerous offspring Before this event, by private application to law books and enquiry into rules of practice. he had rendered himself no mean counsellor for his neighbors, and acquired no small repu- tation for legal learning and capacity. After his elevation to the bench, he often recurred with pleasure to the moment he appeared for the first time in the presence of regular law yer. An acquaintance happening to require the assistance of one, Mir. Sherman, who Was going to the county town, was commissioned to seek out the best. Before he left home he digested the case in writing and as he stated it to the gentleman whom he consulted, he frequently resorted to his manuscript, which wns at length demanded from curiosity. The lawyer, after reading it, remarked. with an air of surprise, that with few alterations in form, it would be equal 10 any petition which he could himself prepare and when he had asked some questions concerning his situation and views in life, advised him to adopt the profession of the law Such encouragement was not without its effect in awakening his ambition and concentrating his attention :-| his friends were as eager as himself that he should be a lawyer; and matters were so soon ripened, that in 1754, he was admitted in the courts to practice. In the following year he was placed in the commission of the peace of New-Milford, and chosen by the freemen to represent them in the colonial assembly. This was the commencement of his public career, at the thirty-third year of his age.\n\n He continued to practice the law with pro- fit and reputation until 1759, when he was ap- pointed judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the county. In 1761 he removed from New-Milford to New-Haven, a better sphere of action, in which he quickly attained all that he could desire. The town of New-Ha,en elected him repeatedly to the legislature. In l765, he was appointed one of the judges of the Court of Common Pleas. He became treasurer of the College, and receiv ed the hen orary degree of master of arts. He had large share in the legislative proceedings. not only as regarded the concerns of Connecticut, but those of the Colon'rs in general His sound, sagaeious sense, his comprehensive informa- ton, his close reasoning, enforced by plain, manly delivery, and his decision on principal questions, acquired for him an almost unri- vailed authority in the. Connecticut councils. In i766, he was raised to the office of judge of the Superior Court. station which he re- talned 2S years, and filled with an ahfv and",

MT. Jefferson, in letter relating to him, ob- servcs-\"I served with him in the old Con- gress in the years 1775 and l776. He was very able and logical debater in that body steady in the principles of the revolution; al ways at the post of duty much employed in the business of Committees, and particularly was of the Committee of Dr. Franklin, MT. J. Adams and myself for preparing the Decla- ration of Independence\" He was also suc- cessively member of War and Ordnance, of the Treasury board and of the Marine com mittee. During the whole revolutionary strug- gle, he manifested a dauntless spirit as we'll as an ndefatigable zeal.\n\n In 1784 when New Haven was incorpora- ted, he was elected to the office of Mayor of the city, which he held for the remainder ol his life. About the same period, he was as- sociated with another of the Judges of the Superior Court, in the task of revising and digesting the statutes 0f Connecticut, SO as to produce an improved code for the State. This oppressive service was performed with his usual conscientiousness and success. In 1787, he was appointed a delegate to the General Convention to frame the Federal Constitution of the United States. One of his colleagues was the celebrated Oliver Els worth, who held the office of associate judge of the same court, and wLo as he himself de clared had made MT. Sherman his model in his youth. The venerable President Adams\n\n mentions that '' he never saw two men more\n\n alike, except that the late Chief Justice Els worth had the advantage of a liberal educa ton, and somewhat more extensive reading , Both were conspicuous in the Convention fo , the earnestness and usefulness of their coop eration in tho glorious work of that body Sherman wrote series of essays under thu 1 signature of\" Citizen,\" in favor of the con\n\n stitution, which are affirmed to have materi\n\n ally contributed to procure that full majority\n\n by which it was ratified in Connecticut. Wher I it went into operation, he was elected rep resentative in Congress, and though vergins toward his 7Oth year, took deep interest & active part in the proceedings of the new House.\n\n At the expiration of his first term, he was translated to the Senate, among whom he was never found backward, either in debate oI committee service, touching the various impOr- tant subjects which then came under discus sion. Providence, however, allowed him but two years more of a race thus signaized, in public and private, by dispositions and endea- yours which were well adapted to propitiate Divine favour for another life. He died at New-Haven, on the Sd July, 179S, aged sev- enty two. He had been from his youth de- vout christian, and constant reader of the Scriptures. He maintained correspondence, at different times, on abstruse points of the ology and metaphysics, with some of the most erudite and eminent among the New England clergymen.\n\n In person, Roger Sherman was tall his form was erect and well proportioned; his complexion fair, and his countenance manly and agreeable. Though reserved pnd taciturn in soclaintercourse,h he could not be taxed with austerity; nor with want of liberality, though frugal and abstemious. On all occasions his chief objects appeared to be the welfare of his country, and the triumph of justice.",

            "article": "ROaER SHERMAN was born on the lSth OI April, 172l, at NewtOG in Massachusetts, the residence of his father, farmer ln niOderate circumstances. Roger enjoyed no other eu- ,,cat;on than the very limited one which the common country schools of New-Engiand afforded at that period. In his early boyhood he was apprenticed to shoemaker ana ne followed the same trade for some tune after he was twenty one years of age lie recet- ed from nature a vigorous and Inqn'sitlVe mino' the energies of which were net to be repres- s.d even by the drudgery of his mechanical labour. Books happened to be within his reach. such as tended to enlarge and fcrtify the understanding and with them he contrl- we'd, like Dr. Franklin, to gratify his thirst for knowledge, while he performed his work as an apprentice. Before he had reached his ma iority he became even proficient in geOgTa- phy, the mathematics, and the principles of moral science. Politics and the law equally engaged his attention, and in both he rose, as we shall see in the sequel to great emnence the more honorable as it was marked by su- perior usefulness and uniform public virtue. In no stage of his long career did he ever dis play the least desire to conceal the nature of his first calling, nor any pride in his transition to the most digniied pursuits and stations. During the revolutionary war, he W as placed on a committee of Congress to investigate cer- tain army accounts, among which were some relating to contract for the supply of shoes. He told the committee that the charges were exorbitant, which he prove by specifilng the cost of the different materials and the work manship. Perceiving that the minuteness & confidence with which this was done excited some surprise, he informed the committee that he was by trade shoemaker, and was perfectly acquainted with the cost of the arti- cles.\n\n At the decease of his father he was only nineteen years of age, and yet the mainte- nance of mother and a numerous family of brothers and sisters devolved chiefly on him :; charge which he bore with success, owing to his regular industry in the cultivation of the paternal acres and his skill as an artisan. In l743, it was deemed advisable for the family to dispose of their property at Newton. and remove to New Milford, Litchfeld County Connecticut.-There relinquishing his trade as a shoemaker. he commenced at once thu business of country merchant; and opened shop in connection with an elder brother. IT l745, two years after his removal into the colony of Connecticut, he was appointed q surveyor of lands for the county in which he resided-an advancement due to his mathe- nautical studies. Astronomical calculations oi SO early date as the year 1748 have been discovered among his papers. He made them for an Almanac then published in NewYork, which he supplied thus for several consecutive years.\n\n At the age of 28, he married respectable female, who gave him a numerous offspring Before this event, by private application to law books and enquiry into rules of practice. he had rendered himself no mean counsellor for his neighbors, and acquired no small repu- tation for legal learning and capacity. After his elevation to the bench, he often recurred with pleasure to the moment he appeared for the first time in the presence of regular law yer. An acquaintance happening to require the assistance of one, Mir. Sherman, who Was going to the county town, was commissioned to seek out the best. Before he left home he digested the case in writing and as he stated it to the gentleman whom he consulted, he frequently resorted to his manuscript, which wns at length demanded from curiosity. The lawyer, after reading it, remarked. with an air of surprise, that with few alterations in form, it would be equal 10 any petition which he could himself prepare and when he had asked some questions concerning his situation and views in life, advised him to adopt the profession of the law Such encouragement was not without its effect in awakening his ambition and concentrating his attention :-| his friends were as eager as himself that he should be a lawyer; and matters were so soon ripened, that in 1754, he was admitted in the courts to practice. In the following year he was placed in the commission of the peace of New-Milford, and chosen by the freemen to represent them in the colonial assembly. This was the commencement of his public career, at the thirty-third year of his age.\n\n He continued to practice the law with pro- fit and reputation until 1759, when he was ap- pointed judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the county. In 1761 he removed from New-Milford to New-Haven, a better sphere of action, in which he quickly attained all that he could desire. The town of New-Ha,en elected him repeatedly to the legislature. In l765, he was appointed one of the judges of the Court of Common Pleas. He became treasurer of the College, and receiv ed the hen orary degree of master of arts. He had large share in the legislative proceedings. not only as regarded the concerns of Connecticut, but those of the Colon'rs in general His sound, sagaeious sense, his comprehensive informa- ton, his close reasoning, enforced by plain, manly delivery, and his decision on principal questions, acquired for him an almost unri- vailed authority in the. Connecticut councils. In i766, he was raised to the office of judge of the Superior Court. station which he re- talned 2S years, and filled with an ahfv and",
