It would have been we'll\nto have committed the matter to some more skfu\nhand than Corporal Harker's. But the Corporal is\nf\" faithful and fearless\"-and no doubt considered\nhimself equal to the task In The FIRST place, the\nCorporal dslikes the bill and. in the next, from\nthe tenor Of his remarks, would throw the odium\nOf it iii there is any thing odous in IT'D upon the\nEastern States.\n\n\nNow what are the facts? The Woolen Bill\npassed the House BY LOG votes, not one third Of\nwhich were given by men from the Eastern States.\nWhy, them abuse the Eastern States, when more\nthan tco thirds OF the votes in favor Of this mea\nsure, were given by members from other States !?\n.New York, having \"a votes, gave more than\nthree fourths OF them for the bill.\nPennsylvania, having 26 votes, gave more than\nt,Uo thirds Of them for the bill.\nOhio, having IA votes. gave Is Of them for the\nbill.\n\n\nN'ew Jersey, having votes, gave all Of them for\nthe bill.\n\n\nBesides, there were votes in favor Of this bill,\nfrom Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana. Missouri. and\nMarylsnd\n\n\nThe article in the Gazette Of last Friday, there\nfore. was bungling, il not most base and wiiful\nattempt, to mislead the public the subject Of the\nWooden Bill. The Bill to \" overwhelm manufac.\nturers every where else\" excepting in the Eastern\nStates As if New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and\nNew Jersey, all roting Tor this measure, have no\nmanufactures Of their own, and did not know their\nown interests! To /\" \"overwhem manufacturers cv.\ncry where else y Very likely, to be sure, that SO\nmen could induce 70 others to commit suicide\nVery likely, to be sure, that 73 members Of Con\ngress never found out that they we're overwhelming\nthe manufactures of their own States, until the g.\ncute, penetrating, and most sagacious MIR. Samuel\nHarker had made the discovery for them.\n| All this won't do. We must have some other\nstate Of the case, approaching nearer to truth and\nto fact. BRANDYWINE.",
