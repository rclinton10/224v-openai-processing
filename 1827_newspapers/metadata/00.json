If Asia Minor had been overrun by the Barbarians of the North, it might have retained or recovered both it's civilization and religion, for those barbarians have been susceptible of both in Europe. If it had been seized by Persia; it would have been in the hands of peo- pie holding a high rank in Eastern civili- zation, not averse to European improve ment, not furiously bigotted to their own blind superstition. But a tribe of robbers was summoned from the mountains, where they had been kept like a frozen torrent for ages, till the moment when its whole loosened might was to rush down upon the plain. They had no letters, no legisla- ton, no knowledge they were utterly new race, separated from all the accesses by which civilization might approach, with no means of Government but the sabre, no law but the Koran, and no purpose but conquest. animal indulgence, and merciless tyranny they were sent forth to take pos session of the land, and fearfully they exc cuted their commission.\n\n But in all those visitations of Providence which we are permitted to follow, the ap- parent tardiness ofthe punishmentis scarce .ly less remarkable than the completeness, when all is done. The coming of the Turks was before the Church of Asia for the astonishing period of almost thousand years. From their first burst they were an object of acknowledged terror the thun- der cloud fixed every eye, from the emoment of it's gathering on the great central chain of the Asiatic hills; in its first advances it lad nearly broke over the empire, but it was strangely turned away, and thus con- tinued the storm, alternately approaching and retiring, till it was finally rolled upon Censtantinople. In the year 545, the Turks issued from the Imans. In half q century, they had conquered the huge Ta- ble land of the North, and touched with their standards at once the Roman borders, the Persian, and the Chinese. Warning at the head of the Tartar tribes, their chief force was cavalry, and their cavalry was computed by millions ''* They then paused. But other leaders reused them again, and in 844 they passed the head of the Caspian, and fixed a governmental in the greater Armenia. In 1O38 they again re- ceded, turned to the south, and overrun the Persian empire.\n\n The later princes of Constantinople had sometimes redeemed the character of the throne; and instances of vaIor, conduct, and virtue, are to be found even among chieftains bred up in the effeminacy of the most luxurious court of the world. The Saracens had been repelled, after long succession of tremendous battles, and the Roman territory had been extended by Ncephorus, and his successor Basil, to the eastern boundaries of Armenia. The em- pire reposed for while under the banners of this brave and unfortunate chieftain, when at once it was startled by an inun- dation of war. The Turkish cavalry had overspread the whole frontier, from Tau rus to Arzoum, a line of six hundred miles. Their progress was strewed with massacre, and this invasion cost of the subjects of the Greek Emperor, a hundred and thirty thousand lives; but while Constantinople was already closing its gates, the invasion sank away into the desert, and the lesson was forgotten. But it was rapidly renew ed |; in 1O62, the l\" Grand Sultan' of the Turks, Arparzlan, rushed upon Cesarea, at the head of an innumerable almy. He swept all before him for some years, but fortune at length gave moments respite to the Greeks, and in 1O6S the Sultan was forced to cross the Euphrates. He return ed with the swiftness and ferocity of bar barian revenge; and in 1O71, by one bloody battle, finally broke the power of the Em- perors in Asia.\n\n The blow was now ready to come down. It was still averted. A civil war begun a. mong the Turks, which perhaps saved the whole of Europe from desolation, like that of India by Timour. The western world had yet no force to oppose the sav- age, yet not undisciplined vigor, and the inexIlaustible multitudes of the Turkish cavalry. ss The fairest thrones of Europe might have still descended to succession of grim barbarians, and the mountain and the desert might have been the desperate refuge of her people. Europe might to this hour have been like Spain in the days of Pelayo. The civil war divided this ir- ror;ct;hIo n,aSs Of nower. and fOlIr dynas-",

            "raw_text": "We have long been anxious to make some observations on Greece. The na- tional interesttfelt in the fates of the coun- try, the deep political questions involved in the contest, and the formidable proba- bility that the -insurrectionary war may light flame Hthat will spread through Eu- rope, urges it upon us. But there was a general deficiency of facts; the friends and enemies of the cause had equally. given themselves up to romance, and it was es- sential to truth to wait until those mutual misrepresenlations had been, in some measure, cleared away. This has been lately accomplished some travellers, led only by a rational and intelligent curiosity, have within short period visited Greece. Their works are now before the public, and from those sources, and such others as our personal knowledge might supply, general view of the question may be formed, free from romance, partialty or fiction.\n\n We disclaim all renthusiasm. Yet we do not hesitate to pronounce the cause of Greece the cause of human nature. We allow the greater part of the imputations on the Greek character-that 1t IS rash, given to quarrel, suspicious, inconstant, and7 careless 'of blood. But the Crock has not had his trial. He has been for al- most five hundred years.fA broken man, His place of birth has beeA only larger prison; his education the bitterness of heart, the subteGfuge, the sullen treachery, and the furious revenge of the slaye.- What estimation can we form of the I, ,L Of decrepit and barbarous servitude Even the vices of the character may be an indi- cation of the Sigor of its capabilities. The perversion of the best things is the worst. The fiery element that, ill its rage, lays waste the land, is the great and exhaust less instrument of comfort and abundance. But the question may be decided at once we know what the Greeks have been If they are now barbarians, we must re- member that they were once the lights of the world.\n\n But the Turk is barbarian. All his vices are thoroughly and incurably barba- ate for plunder, and \"a lover of blood ,-his tastes are barbarian, eXtravagant splendor, gross indulgence, savage indolence of mind and body,-he enjoys none of the resour- ces of civilization,-he has no national lit- erature,-he cultivates no language,-he produces no picture, no statue, no music. Greeks are his linguists, ,and the navigators of his ships,-foreigners discipline his ar- my, and carry on his diplomacy. He re- sists the civilization of Europe with utter scorn, and even when forced upon him by circumstances, he resists it till it's nature is changed, and he is again the Turk of Ma homet the Second ,--he answers religious conviction by the dagger. He sits among the nations with no other instinct than that of the tiger, to seek out his prey, and hav- ing found 1t. to gorge and sleep.\n\n Yet no nation on earth has had such ad- yantages for the most cunsummate civiliza- ton. It has been seated in the central re- zion of the temperate zone,-the' master of its central sea on all it's borders from Syria to Italy on the one side, and to Mauritania OH the other. In the richest, most magnificent and inspiring realm that was ever under tho dominion ofsman-the land filled with those splendid remcmbran- ceS which have been the seed ofknowledge and highmindedness to the ends of the SdTtH llS pidilS anu iHouHtoHio o SuSSOS- sion of trophies to the civil or military glory of tho most illustrious spirits of mankind. Of all this superb dominion, the Turk has been the lord for almost five centuries. Yet he is barbarian still with all the ferocity of the old dweller of the Imans, cyenhis hospitality and bravery are but the virtues of barbarism; and wild, fierce and bloody he will remain, until the purpose of desolation, for which he was brought from his deserts, shall be done.\n\n The greatest and last of all the prophe- acies had declared that the light of the ear- ly Church shnqiassbe extinguished, and pure:G fstiaAity removed to lands remote from its original, throne. The noblest form that Christianity has yetsbeen per mitted to assume, was in its early state on the shores of the Mediterranean. The whole of Asia Minor, then the most four ishing, opulcnt, and' peaceful. portion of the Roman empire, was filled with Chris tian temples. The seven great cities to which the. Apocalypse is directed, were the heads ofthis commonwealth, and the foun- da,ion laid by the Apostles was finished by the work of the hands and blood of a long succession of pure and vigorous followers in the same services and the same glory AL. .I",

Yet there is some curiosity in marking the course by which the Turk advanced to the triumph, over the last citadel of the mightiest dominion that was ever placed in the hands of man. In 1858 the Ottoman armies crossed the sea and established their camp in Europe. Constantinople seems to have been rcspi- ted, like the churches. Her feuds, her op- ulence, and her feebleness, equally invited the military ardor and avarice of lie Sul- tan. Yet, though within a few hours march, ,and perhaps a few hours possession of this most magnificent city of the earth, he drew off his squadrons to the north, and pitched his tent among the solitudes and marshes of Dacia.s Iu 14O3 Bajazet, a chieftain of proverbial boldness and cruel- ty, advanced towards Constantinople. But he was suddenly summoned to, more deadly struggle by the approach ofTimour. The Tartar destroyed his army, but soon turned to triumphs in a more genial climate, and in 14S1, Mahomet the First restored the fallen honors of the Turkish standard. The end was now at hand. The Mosleim had been gradually narrowing their circle round Constantinople commencing almost from the ground on which the Russian troops stand, they had formnd vast cres- cent, touching Asia with one horn, and the Mediterranean with the other. In 1451, {, Mahomet the Second mounted the throne. Constantine Paleologus, the last of that race of Kings which had exhibited such momenteus variety ofguilt and fortune, twas yet not unworthy to close the line of the mightiest of all empires Pious to the best of his knowledge, ,and unquestionably brave, he saw the coming of the inevitable ruin, with determination to treat it as became < a king. He might have probably escaped, but he had evidently determined to perish with the wreck of his empire. He passed the night before the assault in the offices of religion, and on the next morning led his few troops to the breach, and died sword in hand. Constantinoplc was taken May the 29th 145s.\n\n The sudden cessation of the Turkish conquests is scarcely a less singular phe- nomenon. The conquerors of the Greek empire had the thunderbolts in their hands. Europe was open to them through the Mediterranean; they saw before them a vast Continent of struggling and rival states; they had an army of unlimited numbers, sustained by the whole warlike population of the Saracen faith, and whose discipline and equipment excited the aston ishment of the most warlike and enlighten- ed Europeans.t They had the old native thirst of rapine and conquest :; and more formidable than all, the combination, ,enthu- siasm, and devoted bravery of Islamism.-- But their career was suddenly closed it was said to this Ocean of living power, \"Here shall thy proud waves be stayed. .\"- The conquest of the territory ofthe prim- tive church was complete, and the work of the dynasty of Othman was done. The last permanent possession of the Turks was acquired in 1872, scarcely beyond a centu- ry iron, their sitting on the throne of Con- stantinople. In that year Mahomet the Fourth took the city of Kamcniec. Its territory of for,y-eight towns and villa ges was given up to the Ottomans by the peace.f ~-.\n\n Another not less singular phenomenon is the permanency of this empire. Forthese hundred and fifty years it has had upon its countenance all the symptoms of falling power. A fuctuating government, assail- ed by perpetual and bloody revolution, re- bellous provinces, and a mutinous army, a frontier pressed upon by two gigantic military despotisms ofthe South and North, Austria and Russia, long wars always att tended with defeat; yet what has Turkey lost All the politicians of Europe have for this century and half been predicting her speedy ruin :; yet, until the Greek in- snrrection, she had not lost province.- We disclaim the common rashness of at tributing things in the ordinary and trivial courses of life to an interposing Provi- dence; but it is not unsuitable to humility, nor unsupported by the declared acting of the great Disposer, to conceive him exer- cising his high perogative in the fates of nations; and above all, in the fates, the punishnents, and the preservations of his Church. When it shall be his will to re- lieve the fairest portion of early Christen- dom, the land of the apostles, the saints and martyrs, the Mount Zion of Christian ity, from the trampling of it's savage iords, it shall be accomplished, but not till then. The very difficulty in human eyes of con- tinuing this broken and tottering dominion, may have been for the purpose of compel lin0 ne in follow the path of that mightiest",

The Russian Government was at last in sight of the realization of all its splendid dreams; and was pouring out its whole in- finite strength to take possession of the Mother City of the Eastern Empire. In a moment the whole assault was checked, even at the foot of the rampant. The French trnmpets sounded in the rear of { this confident and triumphant lioSf. A new invader had been urged against Russia ] A great work was to be done there tco.- The long arrear of Western blood and hlas- phemy was to be paid in the Russian des- erts, and it was paid with aterrible fuluess, beyond the power or the expectatio1 of man. But it stopped the ruinsthat hung over the empire of the Ottomans. The Russian armies were torn back from the prey, like hounds that had alreadyf}s;ened their fangs in it's palpitaing flesh, and been sent to hunt down still more savage and guiltier victim. The Turks, from almost broken and suppliant enemies, were instan- taneously raised into equals and allies, and by the treaty of 1912, were gladly reinsta- ted by Russia in every right and province lost by the sword. 1 All those are things out of the common course of earth. 1t is an extraordinary l thing to see a nation of barbarians fixed in a Christian land, and that too the most sa- cred, the most fondly revered by Christian feelings. It tis an extraordinary thing to see a nation utterly resisting the approach es of that brilliant and productive civil!za- tion which absolutely surrounds aud urges itself on tin every form; stubborn and more than iron mass, that lying in the very furnace to which the ancient ruggedncss of all the European barbarism had given way, yet refuses to be softened, or purified, or even to be warmed. It is an extraordiuGt- ry thing to see an empire, the old an. per- petual object of ambition to its greater l military neighbors, who have often combi- ned for its spoliation feeble in all it's parts, yet firm in it's whole-unable to ad- vance foot beyond it own boundaries, vet defying the advance of all others within them-wth rcbelious and mutinous 1 army, short-sighted and brutal policy, King, taken from the Seraglio, and min +istry gathered from the shambles and the streets yet making head against the disci- plined strength, the regular resources, ,alhc improved and combined policy, and the accomplished knowledge, military and min- isterial, that are 'to be found along the whole immense line of hostility openly or secretly arrayed against them.

If Asia Minor had been overrun by the Barbarians of the North, it might have retained or recovered both it's civilization and religion, for those barbarians have been susceptible of both in Europe. If it had been seized by Persia; it would have been in the hands of peo- pie holding a high rank in Eastern civili- zation, not averse to European improve ment, not furiously bigotted to their own blind superstition. But a tribe of robbers was summoned from the mountains, where they had been kept like a frozen torrent for ages, till the moment when its whole loosened might was to rush down upon the plain. They had no letters, no legisla- ton, no knowledge they were utterly new race, separated from all the accesses by which civilization might approach, with no means of Government but the sabre, no law but the Koran, and no purpose but conquest. animal indulgence, and merciless tyranny they were sent forth to take pos session of the land, and fearfully they exc cuted their commission.\n\n But in all those visitations of Providence which we are permitted to follow, the ap- parent tardiness ofthe punishmentis scarce .ly less remarkable than the completeness, when all is done. The coming of the Turks was before the Church of Asia for the astonishing period of almost thousand years. From their first burst they were an object of acknowledged terror the thun- der cloud fixed every eye, from the emoment of it's gathering on the great central chain of the Asiatic hills; in its first advances it lad nearly broke over the empire, but it was strangely turned away, and thus con- tinued the storm, alternately approaching and retiring, till it was finally rolled upon Censtantinople. In the year 545, the Turks issued from the Imans. In half q century, they had conquered the huge Ta- ble land of the North, and touched with their standards at once the Roman borders, the Persian, and the Chinese. Warning at the head of the Tartar tribes, their chief force was cavalry, and their cavalry was computed by millions ''* They then paused. But other leaders reused them again, and in 844 they passed the head of the Caspian, and fixed a governmental in the greater Armenia. In 1O38 they again re- ceded, turned to the south, and overrun the Persian empire.\n\n The later princes of Constantinople had sometimes redeemed the character of the throne; and instances of vaIor, conduct, and virtue, are to be found even among chieftains bred up in the effeminacy of the most luxurious court of the world. The Saracens had been repelled, after long succession of tremendous battles, and the Roman territory had been extended by Ncephorus, and his successor Basil, to the eastern boundaries of Armenia. The em- pire reposed for while under the banners of this brave and unfortunate chieftain, when at once it was startled by an inun- dation of war. The Turkish cavalry had overspread the whole frontier, from Tau rus to Arzoum, a line of six hundred miles. Their progress was strewed with massacre, and this invasion cost of the subjects of the Greek Emperor, a hundred and thirty thousand lives; but while Constantinople was already closing its gates, the invasion sank away into the desert, and the lesson was forgotten. But it was rapidly renew ed |; in 1O62, the l\" Grand Sultan' of the Turks, Arparzlan, rushed upon Cesarea, at the head of an innumerable almy. He swept all before him for some years, but fortune at length gave moments respite to the Greeks, and in 1O6S the Sultan was forced to cross the Euphrates. He return ed with the swiftness and ferocity of bar barian revenge; and in 1O71, by one bloody battle, finally broke the power of the Em- perors in Asia.\n\n The blow was now ready to come down. It was still averted. A civil war begun a. mong the Turks, which perhaps saved the whole of Europe from desolation, like that of India by Timour. The western world had yet no force to oppose the sav- age, yet not undisciplined vigor, and the inexIlaustible multitudes of the Turkish cavalry. ss The fairest thrones of Europe might have still descended to succession of grim barbarians, and the mountain and the desert might have been the desperate refuge of her people. Europe might to this hour have been like Spain in the days of Pelayo. The civil war divided this ir- ror;ct;hIo n,aSs Of nower. and fOlIr dynas-",

            "article": "We have long been anxious to make some observations on Greece. The na- tional interesttfelt in the fates of the coun- try, the deep political questions involved in the contest, and the formidable proba- bility that the -insurrectionary war may light flame Hthat will spread through Eu- rope, urges it upon us. But there was a general deficiency of facts; the friends and enemies of the cause had equally. given themselves up to romance, and it was es- sential to truth to wait until those mutual misrepresenlations had been, in some measure, cleared away. This has been lately accomplished some travellers, led only by a rational and intelligent curiosity, have within short period visited Greece. Their works are now before the public, and from those sources, and such others as our personal knowledge might supply, general view of the question may be formed, free from romance, partialty or fiction.\n\n We disclaim all renthusiasm. Yet we do not hesitate to pronounce the cause of Greece the cause of human nature. We allow the greater part of the imputations on the Greek character-that 1t IS rash, given to quarrel, suspicious, inconstant, and7 careless 'of blood. But the Crock has not had his trial. He has been for al- most five hundred years.fA broken man, His place of birth has beeA only larger prison; his education the bitterness of heart, the subteGfuge, the sullen treachery, and the furious revenge of the slaye.- What estimation can we form of the I, ,L Of decrepit and barbarous servitude Even the vices of the character may be an indi- cation of the Sigor of its capabilities. The perversion of the best things is the worst. The fiery element that, ill its rage, lays waste the land, is the great and exhaust less instrument of comfort and abundance. But the question may be decided at once we know what the Greeks have been If they are now barbarians, we must re- member that they were once the lights of the world.\n\n But the Turk is barbarian. All his vices are thoroughly and incurably barba- ate for plunder, and \"a lover of blood ,-his tastes are barbarian, eXtravagant splendor, gross indulgence, savage indolence of mind and body,-he enjoys none of the resour- ces of civilization,-he has no national lit- erature,-he cultivates no language,-he produces no picture, no statue, no music. Greeks are his linguists, ,and the navigators of his ships,-foreigners discipline his ar- my, and carry on his diplomacy. He re- sists the civilization of Europe with utter scorn, and even when forced upon him by circumstances, he resists it till it's nature is changed, and he is again the Turk of Ma homet the Second ,--he answers religious conviction by the dagger. He sits among the nations with no other instinct than that of the tiger, to seek out his prey, and hav- ing found 1t. to gorge and sleep.\n\n Yet no nation on earth has had such ad- yantages for the most cunsummate civiliza- ton. It has been seated in the central re- zion of the temperate zone,-the' master of its central sea on all it's borders from Syria to Italy on the one side, and to Mauritania OH the other. In the richest, most magnificent and inspiring realm that was ever under tho dominion ofsman-the land filled with those splendid remcmbran- ceS which have been the seed ofknowledge and highmindedness to the ends of the SdTtH llS pidilS anu iHouHtoHio o SuSSOS- sion of trophies to the civil or military glory of tho most illustrious spirits of mankind. Of all this superb dominion, the Turk has been the lord for almost five centuries. Yet he is barbarian still with all the ferocity of the old dweller of the Imans, cyenhis hospitality and bravery are but the virtues of barbarism; and wild, fierce and bloody he will remain, until the purpose of desolation, for which he was brought from his deserts, shall be done.\n\n The greatest and last of all the prophe- acies had declared that the light of the ear- ly Church shnqiassbe extinguished, and pure:G fstiaAity removed to lands remote from its original, throne. The noblest form that Christianity has yetsbeen per mitted to assume, was in its early state on the shores of the Mediterranean. The whole of Asia Minor, then the most four ishing, opulcnt, and' peaceful. portion of the Roman empire, was filled with Chris tian temples. The seven great cities to which the. Apocalypse is directed, were the heads ofthis commonwealth, and the foun- da,ion laid by the Apostles was finished by the work of the hands and blood of a long succession of pure and vigorous followers in the same services and the same glory AL. .I",

In 1858 the Ottoman armies crossed the sea and established their camp in Europe. Constantinople seems to have been rcspi- ted, like the churches. Her feuds, her op- ulence, and her feebleness, equally invited the military ardor and avarice of lie Sul- tan. Yet, though within a few hours march, ,and perhaps a few hours possession of this most magnificent city of the earth, he drew off his squadrons to the north, and pitched his tent among the solitudes and marshes of Dacia.s Iu 14O3 Bajazet, a chieftain of proverbial boldness and cruel- ty, advanced towards Constantinople. But he was suddenly summoned to, more deadly struggle by the approach ofTimour. The Tartar destroyed his army, but soon turned to triumphs in a more genial climate, and in 14S1, Mahomet the First restored the fallen honors of the Turkish standard. The end was now at hand. The Mosleim had been gradually narrowing their circle round Constantinople commencing almost from the ground on which the Russian troops stand, they had formnd vast cres- cent, touching Asia with one horn, and the Mediterranean with the other. In 1451, {, Mahomet the Second mounted the throne. Constantine Paleologus, the last of that race of Kings which had exhibited such momenteus variety ofguilt and fortune, twas yet not unworthy to close the line of the mightiest of all empires Pious to the best of his knowledge, ,and unquestionably brave, he saw the coming of the inevitable ruin, with determination to treat it as became < a king. He might have probably escaped, but he had evidently determined to perish with the wreck of his empire. He passed the night before the assault in the offices of religion, and on the next morning led his few troops to the breach, and died sword in hand. Constantinoplc was taken May the 29th 145s.\n\n The sudden cessation of the Turkish conquests is scarcely a less singular phe- nomenon. The conquerors of the Greek empire had the thunderbolts in their hands. Europe was open to them through the Mediterranean; they saw before them a vast Continent of struggling and rival states; they had an army of unlimited numbers, sustained by the whole warlike population of the Saracen faith, and whose discipline and equipment excited the aston ishment of the most warlike and enlighten- ed Europeans.t They had the old native thirst of rapine and conquest :; and more formidable than all, the combination, ,enthu- siasm, and devoted bravery of Islamism.-- But their career was suddenly closed it was said to this Ocean of living power, \"Here shall thy proud waves be stayed. .\"- The conquest of the territory ofthe prim- tive church was complete, and the work of the dynasty of Othman was done. The last permanent possession of the Turks was acquired in 1872, scarcely beyond a centu- ry iron, their sitting on the throne of Con- stantinople. In that year Mahomet the Fourth took the city of Kamcniec. Its territory of for,y-eight towns and villa ges was given up to the Ottomans by the peace.f ~-.\n\n Another not less singular phenomenon is the permanency of this empire. Forthese hundred and fifty years it has had upon its countenance all the symptoms of falling power. A fuctuating government, assail- ed by perpetual and bloody revolution, re- bellous provinces, and a mutinous army, a frontier pressed upon by two gigantic military despotisms ofthe South and North, Austria and Russia, long wars always att tended with defeat; yet what has Turkey lost All the politicians of Europe have for this century and half been predicting her speedy ruin :; yet, until the Greek in- snrrection, she had not lost province.- We disclaim the common rashness of at tributing things in the ordinary and trivial courses of life to an interposing Provi- dence; but it is not unsuitable to humility, nor unsupported by the declared acting of the great Disposer, to conceive him exer- cising his high perogative in the fates of nations; and above all, in the fates, the punishnents, and the preservations of his Church. When it shall be his will to re- lieve the fairest portion of early Christen- dom, the land of the apostles, the saints and martyrs, the Mount Zion of Christian ity, from the trampling of it's savage iords, it shall be accomplished, but not till then. The very difficulty in human eyes of con- tinuing this broken and tottering dominion, may have been for the purpose of compel lin0 ne in follow the path of that mightiest",

The Russian Government was at last in sight of the realization of all its splendid dreams; and was pouring out its whole in- finite strength to take possession of the Mother City of the Eastern Empire. In a moment the whole assault was checked, even at the foot of the rampant. The French trnmpets sounded in the rear of { this confident and triumphant lioSf. A new invader had been urged against Russia ] A great work was to be done there tco.- The long arrear of Western blood and hlas- phemy was to be paid in the Russian des- erts, and it was paid with aterrible fuluess, beyond the power or the expectatio1 of man. But it stopped the ruinsthat hung over the empire of the Ottomans. The Russian armies were torn back from the prey, like hounds that had alreadyf}s;ened their fangs in it's palpitaing flesh, and been sent to hunt down still more savage and guiltier victim. The Turks, from almost broken and suppliant enemies, were instan- taneously raised into equals and allies, and by the treaty of 1912, were gladly reinsta- ted by Russia in every right and province lost by the sword. 1 All those are things out of the common course of earth. 1t is an extraordinary l thing to see a nation of barbarians fixed in a Christian land, and that too the most sa- cred, the most fondly revered by Christian feelings. It tis an extraordinary thing to see a nation utterly resisting the approach es of that brilliant and productive civil!za- tion which absolutely surrounds aud urges itself on tin every form; stubborn and more than iron mass, that lying in the very furnace to which the ancient ruggedncss of all the European barbarism had given way, yet refuses to be softened, or purified, or even to be warmed. It is an extraordiuGt- ry thing to see an empire, the old an. per- petual object of ambition to its greater l military neighbors, who have often combi- ned for its spoliation feeble in all it's parts, yet firm in it's whole-unable to ad- vance foot beyond it own boundaries, vet defying the advance of all others within them-wth rcbelious and mutinous 1 army, short-sighted and brutal policy, King, taken from the Seraglio, and min +istry gathered from the shambles and the streets yet making head against the disci- plined strength, the regular resources, ,alhc improved and combined policy, and the accomplished knowledge, military and min- isterial, that are 'to be found along the whole immense line of hostility openly or secretly arrayed against them. It isanex- traordinary thing to see Mahometanism preserved in portion of Europe, and pre- served in its original strictness, blindness and ferocity, when 1t has been superseded, or decayed in it's original seats, when as [, national religion, it has been !unsastained by any of those forms of privilege and emolument which seem necessary for the permanence of religion in the conflicting and worldly urgency ofhuman pursuits and professions; and even with a vast pro- portion of its productive subjects, nearly the entire of its tributaries, it's merchants, ! it's foreign agents, and its manufacturers, Christian. It is an extraordinary thing that. cruel and despotic Domination, over whose utter ruin every heart in Europe would exult--for which not voice would be raised, from one end of the earth to the other, to whose fall the most patriotic and enlightened philosophy looks as to life from the dead, to the restoration of Asia, to the recovery of the ,.loveliest region of the globe to knowledge, peace, and religion-- should Dc still undiminished, should cover thai glorious land, like the mass flung out from tho volcano, the fiery torrent, check cd indeed in it's headlong career, but there hardened into incorrigible rock, a huge and sullen heap of sterility, to be neither cul- tivated nor removed by the power of man.\n\n - IO De continued.\n\n @ *Gibbon. fSee Busbequius, &c.\n\n 4See Cantemir,---' Decay of the Otto- man Empire\"\n\n From the La Belle Assensblee.\n\n WEDDINGS;-BY A PARISH CLERK. f have seen, to be sure, many unwilling bridegrooms in my time.
