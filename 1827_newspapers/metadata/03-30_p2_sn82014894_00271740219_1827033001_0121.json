This evidence OF Gen. SMITH\nought to be deemed conclusive, as his speech ap-\n\n\npgars to have been so deemed by the majority OF\n\n\nthe Senate, Of whom he was one.\n\n\nMr.. JOHNSTON, Of Louisiana, IN ms speeGh'\n\n\nSAYS, \" At the last session, memorial, praying the\n\n\nremoval of the discriminating duty, was referred\n\n\nto the Committee of Commerce, who made report\ndeclining legislation, because it was proper sub\nect for negotiation A bill for that purpose was,\nhowever, introduced, but was not acted upon tor\n\n\nrant of time\" \"When the gentleman from Ma\nryland applied to the President and Secretary OF\nState, they both said it might be repealed they\n\n\nmade no objection they did not dissuade him ;\nthey both told him there was no longer any diff\nGuilty in the adjustment of the affair with Great\n\n\nBritain; that the negotiations were about TO be re-\nnewed. 1t was mere question, whether It was\nbetter to give them this in advance, or hold it in\nentirely at liberty, and he so stated in his speech\nof last year\"\n\n\nThus it appears that II was not the Aiministra-\nton, but the want of time, that prevented the pas\nsage of the bill. The President and Secretary OF\nState when applied to,t appears, frankly gave their\nopinion. They thought it best to effect the object\nby negotiation, the means in which both Govern\nments, up to that time, had confided; but they did\nnot attempt to control the action OF the Senate,\nwhich was left free to pursue its own course, and\nwhich appears would have passeda bill if it could\nhave found the time.\n\n\nAfter all. neither the Administration, nor the\n0pp f,np IN fhn dnin or N nh\naccount of the present state of this question:\nGreat Britain alone is chageable with the existing\ncondition Of the controversy. Had she notified the\nAmerican Government, in March, 1895, that she\nwould not negotiate, instead of inviting It to renew\n\n\nthe negotiation, the question might have been salts\nfactorily settled at the session Of Congress pre-\nvious to the last for the difference between an\nadjustment by legislation and by treaty is one OF\nmode only, not materially affecting the substance.\n\n\nThe past, however, ls gone by, and cannot be re-\ncalled Supposing both Governments to have bean\nactuated by equal sincerity, the case exhibited is\none Of mutual misapprehension. Our Executive,\nacting in conformity to the mode agreed upon by\nboth parties, appears to have supposed that the af\nfair would be adjusted by negotiation. The Brit\nish Government, without communicating any\nchange of its intentions in that respect, seems to\nhave expected an arrangement By reciprocal legis-\nlation. The present difference between them is\none Of FORM In this state Of things, the hope may\nbe INDUCED that the two Powers will yet reconcile\ntheir interests in some mode or other. In the\nmean time, as Congress has adjourned without\npassing any new law without afiording to the Ex-\necutive any additional aid, or any light as to its\nwishes, we can see other alternative but for the\nPresident to issue the proclamation which by the\nact of the 1st of March, 1928, he is enoed 70 put\nforth and which, it appears. he has felt himself\nbound to do.

            "raw_text": "\n\n\nTHE CoIohrAL QUESTION sTATEu-It was\nthe sentiment Of the gallant and lamented Deca\ntur that, in all collisions between his country and\nforeign nations, he was in favor OF his own, right\nor wrong. The sentiment may be supposed, by\nsome, to evince an excess Of patriotism, when\napplied to controversies in which ones country i\nCLEARLY in the wrong In all other respects, that IS\nin all cases of doubt, or where country IS clear\n~ right, it will command general concurrence\nIn pronouncing judgment on the difference be-\ntween Great Britain and the United States, in re\ngard to the colonial intercourse, we do not per\nceive that il is necessary to invoke the aid OF tt\nmore questionable part of the sentiment. Fo'\nhaving endeavored to take an unprejudiced we\"\nof this question, it appears to US that the brle\nstatement of the points in dispute, which we no\"\npropose to make, can hardly fail to induce at least\nall impartial citizens to lean to the side OF their\nown Government in this controversy. We ad\ndress the following remarks to such only as have\nnot as vet taken decided stand upon this ques\nton, and who may desire to have clear state\nment Of the case presented to them.\n\n\nDuring the last Administration, then, the two\nGovernments were willing to agree, BY convention,\nthat the trade between the United States and the\nBritish colonies should be limited, as, by their re-\nspectve laws, it was limited, to direct inter.\ncourse between the United States and those colo\nmes. Both were willing to abolish the alien or\ndiscriminating duties as they were levied in their\nrespective ports, Great Britain without condition,\nand the United States upon the condition that their\nproduce in the British West India colonies should\nnot be liable to pay higher duties than similar pro-\nduce coming from any other place, including Bri-\ntsh possessions This was the only point which\nseparated the two Powers. That removed, both\nwere willing to regulate the trade by treaty The\nnegotiation, with which Mr.. Rush was charged,\nwas suspended in 1924, on that only point. The\nparties separated with mutual understanding that\nthey would again renew the negotiation at some\nfuture day, and endeavor to settle the terms of\nthe intercourse BY treaty.\n\n\nSuch was the state of the question under the\nAdministration Of MIR. Monroe. That Admins\ntraton conceived that the produce Of the United\nStates could not sustain, in the British West In\ndia potts fair competition with Canadian pro-\nduce. if It were To be 6urthened with heavy duties\nfrom which Canadian produce was exempted. And,\n# any errar be mpuable ON this subject to the last\nAdministration, (Which is far from being certain)\nit was that Of contending too much in behalf Of\nthe interests Of the United States.\n\n\nThe duty Of deciding on this point Of differ\nence between the two Governments, thus lett un-\ndetermined, devoved on the present Administra-\ntion On full consideration, it appears to have been\nresolved by it, in spirit Of concession and concl-\niation, to yield the point which had prevented Mr..\nRush from concluding convention, in 1924, with\nthe British Government. AS late as the 22d of\nMarch, 1896, the British Minister at Washington,\nin pursuance of instructions, invited the Ameri\ncan Government to renew that negotiation, to\nwhich both parties, up to that time, constantly\nlooked as the means of settling, by treaty,\nthe terms of the colonial intercourse. MIR. Gal\nlatin shortly after went to England, authorized and\ninstructed to conclude convention on the very\nterms which Great Britain had herself proposed\nto Mr.. Rush. Upon his arrival, instead of being\nmet with corresponding disposition-nstead of\nthe British Government being ready to proceed in\nthat negotiation, for which the American Govern\nment had been notified. in the preceding March,\nthat preparations we're making, he was suddenly\nand unexpectedly met by an order in Council. Gle\nsing the British ports against from the first of\nthe ensuing December, and by the annunciatlon,\ntor the first time, of resolution of the British\nGovernment not to treat at all with that of the\nUnited States on the colonial trade.\n\n\nWhatever error, If any, the present Administra.\nton has committed, it certainly has not been that\nOF manitest!ng an unaccommodating spirit tow.\nards Great Britain. 1t may be well doubted in,\ndeed, whether it not disposed to yield too much\nin giving up the principle, insisted upon by the last\nAdministration, that American produce should be\nreceived in British colonial ports, at the sane rate\nu duties and charges with Canadian and other pro\nJnce.\n\n\nOn the point Whether il is most expedent that\nthe trade should be arranged by treaty or by recip\nroca' legislation, II is obvious TO our mind, that the\nformer mode has the advantages, of certainty in\nthe conditions, and permanency. The rule which\n\n\nIT fixes. by the common consent of both parties can\nonly be altered by the concurrence Of both. The\n\n\nafter mode Of arranging the trade, is Liable to the\nobjections OF uncertainty as to the terms Of the\ntrade, and frequency Of change, and may be varied\nby the separate legislation Of either.\n\n\nError has been attributed to the Administration\nbecause Congress did not egislate on the subject\nat the session before the last Well: what nre\nvented Congress from Iesisatns thens 1t is an\nextraordinary reproach to make to the Executive\nthat Congress tld not perform its duty sunnns,n.",

This evidence OF Gen. SMITH\nought to be deemed conclusive, as his speech ap-\n\n\npgars to have been so deemed by the majority OF\n\n\nthe Senate, Of whom he was one.\n\n\nMr.. JOHNSTON, Of Louisiana, IN ms speeGh'\n\n\nSAYS, \" At the last session, memorial, praying the\n\n\nremoval of the discriminating duty, was referred\n\n\nto the Committee of Commerce, who made report\ndeclining legislation, because it was proper sub\nect for negotiation A bill for that purpose was,\nhowever, introduced, but was not acted upon tor\n\n\nrant of time\" \"When the gentleman from Ma\nryland applied to the President and Secretary OF\nState, they both said it might be repealed they\n\n\nmade no objection they did not dissuade him ;\nthey both told him there was no longer any diff\nGuilty in the adjustment of the affair with Great\n\n\nBritain; that the negotiations were about TO be re-\nnewed. 1t was mere question, whether It was\nbetter to give them this in advance, or hold it in\nentirely at liberty, and he so stated in his speech\nof last year\"\n\n\nThus it appears that II was not the Aiministra-\nton, but the want of time, that prevented the pas\nsage of the bill. The President and Secretary OF\nState when applied to,t appears, frankly gave their\nopinion. They thought it best to effect the object\nby negotiation, the means in which both Govern\nments, up to that time, had confided; but they did\nnot attempt to control the action OF the Senate,\nwhich was left free to pursue its own course, and\nwhich appears would have passeda bill if it could\nhave found the time.\n\n\nAfter all. neither the Administration, nor the\n0pp f,np IN fhn dnin or N nh\naccount of the present state of this question:\nGreat Britain alone is chageable with the existing\ncondition Of the controversy. Had she notified the\nAmerican Government, in March, 1895, that she\nwould not negotiate, instead of inviting It to renew\n\n\nthe negotiation, the question might have been salts\nfactorily settled at the session Of Congress pre-\nvious to the last for the difference between an\nadjustment by legislation and by treaty is one OF\nmode only, not materially affecting the substance.\n\n\nThe past, however, ls gone by, and cannot be re-\ncalled Supposing both Governments to have bean\nactuated by equal sincerity, the case exhibited is\none Of mutual misapprehension. Our Executive,\nacting in conformity to the mode agreed upon by\nboth parties, appears to have supposed that the af\nfair would be adjusted by negotiation. The Brit\nish Government, without communicating any\nchange of its intentions in that respect, seems to\nhave expected an arrangement By reciprocal legis-\nlation. The present difference between them is\none Of FORM In this state Of things, the hope may\nbe INDUCED that the two Powers will yet reconcile\ntheir interests in some mode or other. In the\nmean time, as Congress has adjourned without\npassing any new law without afiording to the Ex-\necutive any additional aid, or any light as to its\nwishes, we can see other alternative but for the\nPresident to issue the proclamation which by the\nact of the 1st of March, 1928, he is enoed 70 put\nforth and which, it appears. he has felt himself\nbound to do.

The sentiment may be supposed, by\nsome, to evince an excess Of patriotism, when\napplied to controversies in which ones country i\nCLEARLY in the wrong In all other respects, that IS\nin all cases of doubt, or where country IS clear\n~ right, it will command general concurrence\nIn pronouncing judgment on the difference be-\ntween Great Britain and the United States, in re\ngard to the colonial intercourse, we do not per\nceive that il is necessary to invoke the aid OF tt\nmore questionable part of the sentiment. Fo'\nhaving endeavored to take an unprejudiced we\"\nof this question, it appears to US that the brle\nstatement of the points in dispute, which we no\"\npropose to make, can hardly fail to induce at least\nall impartial citizens to lean to the side OF their\nown Government in this controversy. We ad\ndress the following remarks to such only as have\nnot as vet taken decided stand upon this ques\nton, and who may desire to have clear state\nment Of the case presented to them.\n\n\nDuring the last Administration, then, the two\nGovernments were willing to agree, BY convention,\nthat the trade between the United States and the\nBritish colonies should be limited, as, by their re-\nspectve laws, it was limited, to direct inter.\ncourse between the United States and those colo\nmes. Both were willing to abolish the alien or\ndiscriminating duties as they were levied in their\nrespective ports, Great Britain without condition,\nand the United States upon the condition that their\nproduce in the British West India colonies should\nnot be liable to pay higher duties than similar pro-\nduce coming from any other place, including Bri-\ntsh possessions This was the only point which\nseparated the two Powers. That removed, both\nwere willing to regulate the trade by treaty The\nnegotiation, with which Mr.. Rush was charged,\nwas suspended in 1924, on that only point. The\nparties separated with mutual understanding that\nthey would again renew the negotiation at some\nfuture day, and endeavor to settle the terms of\nthe intercourse BY treaty.\n\n\nSuch was the state of the question under the\nAdministration Of MIR. Monroe. That Admins\ntraton conceived that the produce Of the United\nStates could not sustain, in the British West In\ndia potts fair competition with Canadian pro-\nduce. if It were To be 6urthened with heavy duties\nfrom which Canadian produce was exempted. And,\n# any errar be mpuable ON this subject to the last\nAdministration, (Which is far from being certain)\nit was that Of contending too much in behalf Of\nthe interests Of the United States.\n\n\nThe duty Of deciding on this point Of differ\nence between the two Governments, thus lett un-\ndetermined, devoved on the present Administra-\ntion On full consideration, it appears to have been\nresolved by it, in spirit Of concession and concl-\niation, to yield the point which had prevented Mr..\nRush from concluding convention, in 1924, with\nthe British Government. AS late as the 22d of\nMarch, 1896, the British Minister at Washington,\nin pursuance of instructions, invited the Ameri\ncan Government to renew that negotiation, to\nwhich both parties, up to that time, constantly\nlooked as the means of settling, by treaty,\nthe terms of the colonial intercourse. MIR. Gal\nlatin shortly after went to England, authorized and\ninstructed to conclude convention on the very\nterms which Great Britain had herself proposed\nto Mr.. Rush. Upon his arrival, instead of being\nmet with corresponding disposition-nstead of\nthe British Government being ready to proceed in\nthat negotiation, for which the American Govern\nment had been notified. in the preceding March,\nthat preparations we're making, he was suddenly\nand unexpectedly met by an order in Council. Gle\nsing the British ports against from the first of\nthe ensuing December, and by the annunciatlon,\ntor the first time, of resolution of the British\nGovernment not to treat at all with that of the\nUnited States on the colonial trade.\n\n\nWhatever error, If any, the present Administra.\nton has committed, it certainly has not been that\nOF manitest!ng an unaccommodating spirit tow.\nards Great Britain. 1t may be well doubted in,\ndeed, whether it not disposed to yield too much\nin giving up the principle, insisted upon by the last\nAdministration, that American produce should be\nreceived in British colonial ports, at the sane rate\nu duties and charges with Canadian and other pro\nJnce.\n\n\nOn the point Whether il is most expedent that\nthe trade should be arranged by treaty or by recip\nroca' legislation, II is obvious TO our mind, that the\nformer mode has the advantages, of certainty in\nthe conditions, and permanency. The rule which\n\n\nIT fixes. by the common consent of both parties can\nonly be altered by the concurrence Of both. The\n\n\nafter mode Of arranging the trade, is Liable to the\nobjections OF uncertainty as to the terms Of the\ntrade, and frequency Of change, and may be varied\nby the separate legislation Of either.\n\n\nError has been attributed to the Administration\nbecause Congress did not egislate on the subject\nat the session before the last Well: what nre\nvented Congress from Iesisatns thens 1t is an\nextraordinary reproach to make to the Executive\nthat Congress tld not perform its duty sunnns,n.",
