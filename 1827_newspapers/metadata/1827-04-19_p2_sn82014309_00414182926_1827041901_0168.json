These disputes were not calculated to cement or per petuate the harmony that ought to ensue af- ter long and bloody war. The Persians were the vanquished and bore with an i'll grace the naughty demeanor of their conqnerors. Still the manifest superiority of the Russian arms, and her own internal dissentiOns, con vinced Persia of the necessity of peace. At length all difficulties were supposed to be re- moved. A proposal from the Russian Charge d'Afairs, M. Mozarovitch, was acceded to by the Prince Royal; but when made known to General Yermaloff, he refused to ratify the proposal of his own agent. Another settlement was at length made, and this was rejected by the Shah. This last treaty was made by Fut- teh Alice Khan, and General Yernalolf at Te- Ais in 1925, and every effort was used by the Russian Government of Georgia, to induce the Shah to ratify it, but in vain. At length the Russians cut the matter short, by assuming that the treaty of Futteh Alice Khan was rat flied, and occupied with their troops the lands ccded by this treaty.\n\n Among these lands was small strip called GOkcheh; barren, and of little worth in itself but invaluable in military point of view, and had long been coveted by YermaIofr It is situated on the lake of that name and had been in the possession of Persia for time i'm memorial. The most strenuous rcmonstances were instantly made to the Russian authori- ties against an act which the Persians consid- cred as an usurpaton with a demand that the lands should be evacuated by the Musco- vite soldiery, during the negotiation at any rate. This, however, was refused, unless Per sia would give up, instead, the lands of Kapan, which were equally Persian property-equal- ly her right and honour to retain, and as e. qually arrogant and unreasonable for Russia to demand.\n\n A: this time the Mahomedan subjects of the conquered provinces complained of the mis- rule and interference of the Russian authori- ties with their religion, and preferred their complaints to the head of their church, who came forth from the sanctuary of Kerbelace as the protector of the faithful. A religious enthusiasm was now enkinded-the Moolahs inaamed the minds of the people with popu- IdI ndTdI1SueS--MOSqucS became the theatres of political fury, and the Shah was threatened with the curses of all Mahomedans, and eter- nal perdition, unless he immediately took arms in the holy cause.\n\n To appeasc the fury of this storm, the Shah agreed, that unless Gokcheh-this Malta of the east-was given up, he would declare war against the Russians. With this the Faithful were for the present pacified. The Shah then redoubled his efforts to obtain the possession of Gokcheh but without success.\n\n The Shah had been induced thus to pledge himself to the Moollahs under the conviction that Russia would abandon so insignificant tract of land rather than bring about another war. The Persian government was well a. ware of the dangerous nature of the Russian power. and none more so than the Shah but he had bound himself to this single point, and hls people, finding that the Russians remained lnexorable, called upon hlm to fulfil his prom lse or resign all hopes of heaven. The Prince Royal. Abbas Mirza, then put his army in motion. But even after the troops had march ed, the Shah would gladly have recalled them and SC led amicably all differences, if Russia would have consented to give up Gokcheh, a place which was really not her own, and which no other power, in the then state of negotia- tiOns, had any right to hut Persia. The Prince passed the Georgia frontier and recaptured several provinces subsequently, he met with two or three severe checks, and was compel led to retreat. What has taken place since IS not known hut we may anticipate further",

At times, he amu- sed the audience by flashes of taste and genius, interspersed in his rawlings. As he scattered his vituperations about him, he loved to seize on the feeble and unofend- ing, to show the length of his talons and the ferocity of his heart. He was allow ed to continue his course until the dignity ofthe Senate was lost, the People distress sed, the country disgraced, and the rever- euce heretofore been felt by the people for this high office entirely dispelled; and nothing is now more coEmon than to pity a high-minded man who happens to be found in the Senate, in the discharge of his duty. This leader now, who had nev- CT been followed before, was listened to with delight by those whose en- mites were ranking in their breasts, and who wanted power to unpluck their hearts.\n\n They caught theadisposition without the\n\n talents of their leader, if leader he may be\n\n called, whose cratic course no one could\n\n foretell, but who must be followed without\n\n system or calculation, guided only by the\n\n instinct of his own vengeance.\n\n During the last session ofthe Nineteenth\n\n Congress, it was discovered that the spirit\n\n had not aDated among his deciples in the House of Representatives, who were dis\n\n posed to initiate his example, while he was\n\n exhausted and rebuked by the voice of\n\n his own State, was silent.

He had been, and still was, the advocate for inc indeuendence of South America, and risked his reputation for sagacity OR the event of those countries being able to shake of the foreign yoke, so galiing and oppressive to the spirits struggling to be free. His political doctrines were promul- gated every where and were such as the administration are now favorable to, and now supporting. Distinguished for the mercurial temperament which is one of the constituent principals ot a great speaker, he took part in most important debates, and his inflence was felt in every vote of the House, and every section of the Union. His influence was still increased, when he was chosen to preside over that body for then, attentive to the duties of his office, he was not foreetful of his creed and of- ten. in the committee of the whole, took care\" that his country should be reminded of internal improvements, and suitable tar riffs, as the means of benei,ing the manu-. facturer and agriculturist, without iniuring the merchant. On the subject of State rights he was orthodox to the Constitu- ton that is, that thc true independence of each State IS best secMcd by the adrance- nent of the interest of the UhOLe country.\n\n There was no election of President by the People, and the latter candidate was no longer one, the three others being brought, by the Constitution, into the House of Representatives for selection. It was natural that one so gifted, and sol situated with regard to the people, should have no small influence in the choice, from those presented. The second candidate, for causes before mentioned twas only nom- inally before the House, and the election must fall of course on one of the two others. Who should be taken, and who left was for him to consider, being then member himself from Kentucky. He came to this momentous question with readines, yet with caution, weighing every matter relating to it in the exact balances of reason. He was not unwilling that the Hero of New\n\n Orleans should write his deeds of glory on every laurel in the groves of fame |; and that he might also hew down a thousand branches from the sacred trees to wave on his ovation; but could not consent that he should, at the same time, and for the same cause, wear the civic wreath, which was due to those who had elevated their coun- try by the great, but not less difficult duties of a statesman. Military fame, like Jo- nah's gourd, might grow up in a night, and wither as soon, but the qualifications of a statesman, such as our country demanded, like the elm, requires long succession of returning suns and wintry storms for their growth and perfection.\n\n The speaker, as wen as those WHO were\n\n about to act with him in the election of the\n\n President knew that we were not in a situation to require the talents of mili- tary Chief Magistrate. They were also often reminded, that those in other coun- tries who had been prophesying the down. fall of our republic, from hatred to repub- lican institutions, had named the form and manner in which it would come by rais- ang, sn some moment of thOughtless grati- tude, some Military leader to the Highest cieil hOnOrs and poa0tr 0f Me State. This, it $ true, was said in the days of Washing tOIFs 4 AC uuHSSI tHcu lCdICu was HUI realized but his temper and disposi- ton had been so well tried, that he was to trusted. An exception, however, as he was to all general rules, ,only proves the rule for keeping civil aud military officers distinct from each other, as far as active personal services are required. It could not be winked out of sight neither that the military candidate for this high civil office had twice required the strong arm and lnatchless skill of one great statesman, to shield him from the Peoples indignation, for his fondness for martial law; and this, too, when his garlands were dropping with freshest dews. Such disposition was not to be trusted with the reigns of Government. 1t required no small degree of irmness to discharge one's duty at such crisis. Eve ry engine was set to work to fatter some and awe others. Impatient malice, prompt ed ignorance and folly to impute to the Speaker sinister motives, and not to him alone, but to all the leading men who op- posed the military candidate. He felt these indignities with delicate fibre, but oppo- sed to them too vigorous spirit, and too firm nerve, to find them often repeated. The question at length was happily decid- ed greatly to the satisfaction of the major ity of the nation. Having assisted in put ting Mr. Adams into mower Mr., Clav'S",

That England is bound, now by treaty, to supply Persia with money for carrying on the war and, hereafter by policy and interest to main tain the integrity of Persia. The security of her Indian Empire from European attack is inseparably interwoven with the Independence and safety of Persia.\n\n Is not then this state of things one of para- mount interest to the politicians of Europe and may not great events be expected from what appear now to be very small causes? This subject will probably be agitatcd in Par lament during the present session, when the world may expect from Mir. Canning the frank and honest course which has ever marked his character.\n\n Those who may be desirous of fuller infor- nation on this subject, are referred to the February number of Bl0ckcood's Maguzine. to several recent articles in the Ne,v Times, & to the last three numbers of the Asiatic Jour- nal. From these several sources we have drawn our information.\n\n Expenses >of Monarchy.-A proposition has been made and carried in both houses of Parliament, in consequence of Royal Message, granting the Duke of Clarence an additional sum of G3OOO per annusn and the Dutches of Clarence a further sum of G6OOO per annum, during her life time. Their total allowance will thus amount to G38 500 per annum. In the Lords the grants passed without a division. The Commons, after some opposition divided flor the motion 167. Against it 75.\n\n Duke of York.-It is notorious how much the Duke of York's disorder was ac- celerated by the growing pressure of his pecuniary difficulties. So severe, so de- grading were the forms in which those em- barrassments assailed the illustrious and unfortunate Prince, that neither house, nor furniture, nor horse, nor tangible pro- perty of any kind, incidental to the condi- ton of a gentleman, remained towards the close of life, in his possession. Yet, thus destitute-owing to an enormous debt, of which he could not pay a shillng-with the resistless grasp of death about h:m, how was it that this i'll advised member of the Royal Family commenced building a palace, the construction, decoration, and furnishing of which, were not to be com- pleted for less than half million sterling. London Times. A Nea0 Var.-\" A dispute has arisen between Brazil and Paraguay of so serious 1 nature, that the latter state has suspend ed all communication with the former. Francis has stationed naval force at the mouth of Parsna, ,o prevent the entrance of the Brazilian ships. On this subject correspondence has taken place between the Brazilian Admiral, and the Commo- dore of the Paraguayan squadron. From this correspondence it is evident that at tempts have been made to establish the de- minion of Brazil in Paraguay.\n\n War between the two countries appears to be unavoidable, that all the municipali- ties have agreed to give the Government their revenues in kind, in order that the produce may be applied to defray the ex- pense of the armed force. The proprie- tors will retain only what is necessary for their maintenance.-Fdris Pa.\n\n COlonization Society.-The design of this institution seems to be gaining rapidly and extensively, the favourable opinion of our countrymen an act making an annual appropriation of one thousand dollars to aid the society has passed both houses of the legislature of Maryland.

These disputes were not calculated to cement or per petuate the harmony that ought to ensue af- ter long and bloody war. The Persians were the vanquished and bore with an i'll grace the naughty demeanor of their conqnerors. Still the manifest superiority of the Russian arms, and her own internal dissentiOns, con vinced Persia of the necessity of peace. At length all difficulties were supposed to be re- moved. A proposal from the Russian Charge d'Afairs, M. Mozarovitch, was acceded to by the Prince Royal; but when made known to General Yermaloff, he refused to ratify the proposal of his own agent. Another settlement was at length made, and this was rejected by the Shah. This last treaty was made by Fut- teh Alice Khan, and General Yernalolf at Te- Ais in 1925, and every effort was used by the Russian Government of Georgia, to induce the Shah to ratify it, but in vain. At length the Russians cut the matter short, by assuming that the treaty of Futteh Alice Khan was rat flied, and occupied with their troops the lands ccded by this treaty.\n\n Among these lands was small strip called GOkcheh; barren, and of little worth in itself but invaluable in military point of view, and had long been coveted by YermaIofr It is situated on the lake of that name and had been in the possession of Persia for time i'm memorial. The most strenuous rcmonstances were instantly made to the Russian authori- ties against an act which the Persians consid- cred as an usurpaton with a demand that the lands should be evacuated by the Musco- vite soldiery, during the negotiation at any rate. This, however, was refused, unless Per sia would give up, instead, the lands of Kapan, which were equally Persian property-equal- ly her right and honour to retain, and as e. qually arrogant and unreasonable for Russia to demand.\n\n A: this time the Mahomedan subjects of the conquered provinces complained of the mis- rule and interference of the Russian authori- ties with their religion, and preferred their complaints to the head of their church, who came forth from the sanctuary of Kerbelace as the protector of the faithful. A religious enthusiasm was now enkinded-the Moolahs inaamed the minds of the people with popu- IdI ndTdI1SueS--MOSqucS became the theatres of political fury, and the Shah was threatened with the curses of all Mahomedans, and eter- nal perdition, unless he immediately took arms in the holy cause.\n\n To appeasc the fury of this storm, the Shah agreed, that unless Gokcheh-this Malta of the east-was given up, he would declare war against the Russians. With this the Faithful were for the present pacified. The Shah then redoubled his efforts to obtain the possession of Gokcheh but without success.\n\n The Shah had been induced thus to pledge himself to the Moollahs under the conviction that Russia would abandon so insignificant tract of land rather than bring about another war. The Persian government was well a. ware of the dangerous nature of the Russian power. and none more so than the Shah but he had bound himself to this single point, and hls people, finding that the Russians remained lnexorable, called upon hlm to fulfil his prom lse or resign all hopes of heaven. The Prince Royal. Abbas Mirza, then put his army in motion. But even after the troops had march ed, the Shah would gladly have recalled them and SC led amicably all differences, if Russia would have consented to give up Gokcheh, a place which was really not her own, and which no other power, in the then state of negotia- tiOns, had any right to hut Persia. The Prince passed the Georgia frontier and recaptured several provinces subsequently, he met with two or three severe checks, and was compel led to retreat. What has taken place since IS not known hut we may anticipate further",

At times, he amu- sed the audience by flashes of taste and genius, interspersed in his rawlings. As he scattered his vituperations about him, he loved to seize on the feeble and unofend- ing, to show the length of his talons and the ferocity of his heart. He was allow ed to continue his course until the dignity ofthe Senate was lost, the People distress sed, the country disgraced, and the rever- euce heretofore been felt by the people for this high office entirely dispelled; and nothing is now more coEmon than to pity a high-minded man who happens to be found in the Senate, in the discharge of his duty.

He had earned his fame by bold and incessant efforts of general character. He had been, and still was, the advocate for inc indeuendence of South America, and risked his reputation for sagacity OR the event of those countries being able to shake of the foreign yoke, so galiing and oppressive to the spirits struggling to be free. His political doctrines were promul- gated every where and were such as the administration are now favorable to, and now supporting. Distinguished for the mercurial temperament which is one of the constituent principals ot a great speaker, he took part in most important debates, and his inflence was felt in every vote of the House, and every section of the Union. His influence was still increased, when he was chosen to preside over that body for then, attentive to the duties of his office, he was not foreetful of his creed and of- ten. in the committee of the whole, took care\" that his country should be reminded of internal improvements, and suitable tar riffs, as the means of benei,ing the manu-. facturer and agriculturist, without iniuring the merchant. On the subject of State rights he was orthodox to the Constitu- ton that is, that thc true independence of each State IS best secMcd by the adrance- nent of the interest of the UhOLe country.\n\n There was no election of President by the People, and the latter candidate was no longer one, the three others being brought, by the Constitution, into the House of Representatives for selection. It was natural that one so gifted, and sol situated with regard to the people, should have no small influence in the choice, from those presented. The second candidate, for causes before mentioned twas only nom- inally before the House, and the election must fall of course on one of the two others. Who should be taken, and who left was for him to consider, being then member himself from Kentucky. He came to this momentous question with readines, yet with caution, weighing every matter relating to it in the exact balances of reason. He was not unwilling that the Hero of New\n\n Orleans should write his deeds of glory on every laurel in the groves of fame |; and that he might also hew down a thousand branches from the sacred trees to wave on his ovation; but could not consent that he should, at the same time, and for the same cause, wear the civic wreath, which was due to those who had elevated their coun- try by the great, but not less difficult duties of a statesman. Military fame, like Jo- nah's gourd, might grow up in a night, and wither as soon, but the qualifications of a statesman, such as our country demanded, like the elm, requires long succession of returning suns and wintry storms for their growth and perfection.\n\n The speaker, as wen as those WHO were\n\n about to act with him in the election of the\n\n President knew that we were not in a situation to require the talents of mili- tary Chief Magistrate. They were also often reminded, that those in other coun- tries who had been prophesying the down. fall of our republic, from hatred to repub- lican institutions, had named the form and manner in which it would come by rais- ang, sn some moment of thOughtless grati- tude, some Military leader to the Highest cieil hOnOrs and poa0tr 0f Me State. This, it $ true, was said in the days of Washing tOIFs 4 AC uuHSSI tHcu lCdICu was HUI realized but his temper and disposi- ton had been so well tried, that he was to trusted. An exception, however, as he was to all general rules, ,only proves the rule for keeping civil aud military officers distinct from each other, as far as active personal services are required. It could not be winked out of sight neither that the military candidate for this high civil office had twice required the strong arm and lnatchless skill of one great statesman, to shield him from the Peoples indignation, for his fondness for martial law; and this, too, when his garlands were dropping with freshest dews. Such disposition was not to be trusted with the reigns of Government. 1t required no small degree of irmness to discharge one's duty at such crisis. Eve ry engine was set to work to fatter some and awe others. Impatient malice, prompt ed ignorance and folly to impute to the Speaker sinister motives, and not to him alone, but to all the leading men who op- posed the military candidate. He felt these indignities with delicate fibre, but oppo- sed to them too vigorous spirit, and too firm nerve, to find them often repeated. The question at length was happily decid- ed greatly to the satisfaction of the major ity of the nation. Having assisted in put ting Mr. Adams into mower Mr., Clav'S",

That Russia is in the wrong. at least that her officer in Georgia is so. 2. That Russia has pursued a systematic course of aggression towards Persia for upwards of century past. g. That Persia is the weaker power, and will ultimately fall prey to her enemy. unless she is sustained by some European power. 4. That England is bound, now by treaty, to supply Persia with money for carrying on the war and, hereafter by policy and interest to main tain the integrity of Persia. The security of her Indian Empire from European attack is inseparably interwoven with the Independence and safety of Persia.\n\n Is not then this state of things one of para- mount interest to the politicians of Europe and may not great events be expected from what appear now to be very small causes?

So severe, so de- grading were the forms in which those em- barrassments assailed the illustrious and unfortunate Prince, that neither house, nor furniture, nor horse, nor tangible pro- perty of any kind, incidental to the condi- ton of a gentleman, remained towards the close of life, in his possession.

Francis has stationed naval force at the mouth of Parsna, ,o prevent the entrance of the Brazilian ships. On this subject correspondence has taken place between the Brazilian Admiral, and the Commo- dore of the Paraguayan squadron. From this correspondence it is evident that at tempts have been made to establish the de- minion of Brazil in Paraguay.\n\n War between the two countries appears to be unavoidable, that all the municipali- ties have agreed to give the Government their revenues in kind, in order that the produce may be applied to defray the ex- pense of the armed force.
