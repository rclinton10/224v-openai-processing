The General, in his Carter Beverly letter,\nabove quoted, makes it g early IN January 1895 !\"\nand in his Address to the Public, dated July, 10,\n1927, he makes it in January 1885, rather more\nsafe period Of time, though not quite so precise.\n\n\ng. Mr.. Buchanan, from letters which he wrote on\nthree days, Dec. 30, and 81 1924, and January 2,\n1926, which letters he has probably since seen,\ns' fixes the time\" of his conversation on the Hirtleth\nday Of December, 1924.\n\n\n3. Mr.. Eatonsays that Mr. Buchanan talked with\nhim on the 9Th or 10Th Of Jam 1925, and then had\nhis interview with the General on the snext day\nviz. on the 9th or Goth.\n\n\nNow here seems to be some little difference be-\ntween the \" 30h December, 1894, early in JAN\nuary,\" 'sn January\" and the g 9th or Goth jan\nuary 1926\" Who's right and whose wrong\nMr.. Buchanan declares that he had but one con-\nversation, prior to the election, and we have seen\nthree several periods mentioned at which it took\nplace, with difference of three weeks between the\ntime specified by Mr.. Buchanan and Mr.. Eaton\nBoth are quite sure as to the time, but both cannot\nbe right.\n\n\nIf there are such errors as to time, when one\nfixes the precise day, another makes it early and\nthen sem January, and another the 18th OF goth\nJanuary, 1895, it is not difficult to believe that in\ntheir statements there are\n\n\nSome other differences.\n\n\nLet us see. Mr. Eaton says BY the showing of\nMr.. lsaacks and Mr. Buchanan, it now appears, that\nMr.. Markley was the negociatvr.\" Let us hear Mr..\nBuchanan :. ] called upon Gen. Jackson, on the\noccasion which have mentioned, solely as has friend\nupon my individual responsibility, and not as the\nagent of MIR. Clay, or any OTHER PERSON\"\nNow if Mr.. Markley ncgocidted, he must have ne\ngociated by Mr.. buchanan and yet Mr.. Buchanan\nsays he was neither the Agent Of Mr.. Clay, or\nany other person. and that the conception never\nentered his mind that he (Jackson) believed me to\nhave been the agent of Mr.. Clay, or his friends, or\nthat had intended to propose to him terms OF any\nkind for them,\" and that had he 'ever known or\neven suspected that Gen. Jackson believed he had\nbeen sent to him by Mr.. Clay or his friends, he\n:, should have Immediately corrected his erroneous\n| impression !\" and that he \"had no authority from\nMr.. Clay or his friends to propose any terms in re-\nlation to their votes, nor did he make any such\n: proposition\"\n\n\nPRAY, reader, can you now tell me how this nego\ni citation was carried on Mr.. Buchanan says he hat\nr no hand in the matter. If Gen. Eaton to believed\nIt when he says that Mr.. Markey, negotiated he mus\n# have negotiated the business between Messrs. Cla\nand Buchanan, and the latter gentleman must hav\n. laid the proposition before the Generel. Now, Mr.\n. Buchanan, as we have seen, Denies over and owe\nd again, that he was either the agent OF Mr.. Clay\n\n\nany other person, or that he submitted to the Genera\n# apy proposon on the behalf of MIR. Clay or hi\n!, friends. Mr.. Eaton and MIR. Buchanan, therefore\nE, are at points on this subject. Eaton says, virtually\nv that Buchanan was, and that Buchanan says he wa\n\n\nnot an agent. So it goes.nd so let 1t go, 1t benz\n!. purely Jackson affair altogether.\n\n\nn We cannot however, refrain from making on\nr more remark. It'll on record that DR.. Drake.\nOf man of honour and high character, esttes that MI\nIII CLAW had determined to vote for Mr.. Adams severe\n\n\nmonths before the election, and g that Mr..
