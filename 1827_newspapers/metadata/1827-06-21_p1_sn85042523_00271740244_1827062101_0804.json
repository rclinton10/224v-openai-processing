She frc-\nquenty spoke few words to an eunuch\nwho accompanied her; but the noise was so\ngreat that could hear nothing of their dis\ncourse. As she approached, the spectators\nbecame more quiet; and when she reached\nthe mortar, not sound was to be heard\nTaking advantage of the silence, she spoke\naloud, with distinctness and composure\nthat surprised every one, and made her\nwords ineligible to all. The officers per-\nceiyng that her wild address made some\nimpression on the multitude, here interrupt\n\n\ned her. She made no attempt TO proceecs\nbut resigned herself into their arms. They\nled her in front of the mortar, and yet her\n\n\nsteps never faltercd; neither did she speak\n\n\nor implore as is common for even men to do\nin her situation; neither did she curse as\n\n\nsome do; neither did she weep. They told\nher to kncel down with her breast against\nits muzzle, and she did SO. They put cords\nround her wrists, and bound them to stakes,\n\n\nwhich had been driven for the purpose; still\n\n\nshe showed no signs of emotion; she laid her\nhead upon the mortar, and waited her fate\n\n\nwith a camposure which soldier might\nhave envied. At length the signal was givens\n\n\nthe match was raised; it descended slowly\n\n\nand at the moment when it was about to\n\n\ntouch the powder, an audible shudder ran\n\n\nthrough the crowd The printing caught\n\n\nfire; a moment of sickenng suspense follow\n\n\ned; groan burst from the spectators; the\n\n\nsmoke passed away; and no explosion took\n\n\nplace. The unfortunate wretch raised her\n\n\nhead to see what had happened. 4 faint nope\n\n\nglimmered in my own heart that perhaps\nthis was a device to save her life, but 1t was\n\n\nnot permitted to live long. 1t had scarcely\nbegun to rise within me, when saw the\npriming renewed, and the match ra'sea a.\ngain. The condemned wretch laid her head\nonce more on its hard pillow, and uttered a\n\n\nlow groan as if her spirit had departed. It\n\n\nhad scarcely been uttered when the eSpio-\n\n\nsion took nlace. and the smoke covered eve\nrv thing from my view. AS it gradually\nrlaarrd away, it drew veil from over a\n,, horrid and revolving spectacle. The two\n,, hodiless a rms hung, with their mangled and\nblackrncd ends, from the stakes to which\n: they had been bound; and few yards dis\ntant Law a scorched and shattered foot and\nleg. No trace of body or of head remained\nand a few tattered remnants of clothes were\n= all besides that were left. The arms were\n: unbound from the stakes; and two women\nwho had issued from the ark at the sound\nthe explosion, rushed to the spot, seized then\n\n\nup, and concealing them under their wells\nhurried to the Harem with these proofs tina\n> the demands of justice had been fulfilled\n.

They\nled her in front of the mortar, and yet her\n\n\nsteps never faltercd; neither did she speak\n\n\nor implore as is common for even men to do\nin her situation; neither did she curse as\n\n\nsome do; neither did she weep. They told\nher to kncel down with her breast against\nits muzzle, and she did SO. They put cords\nround her wrists, and bound them to stakes,\n\n\nwhich had been driven for the purpose; still\n\n\nshe showed no signs of emotion; she laid her\nhead upon the mortar, and waited her fate\n\n\nwith a camposure which soldier might\nhave envied. At length the signal was givens\n\n\nthe match was raised; it descended slowly\n\n\nand at the moment when it was about to\n\n\ntouch the powder, an audible shudder ran\n\n\nthrough the crowd The printing caught\n\n\nfire; a moment of sickenng suspense follow\n\n\ned; groan burst from the spectators; the\n\n\nsmoke passed away; and no explosion took\n\n\nplace. The unfortunate wretch raised her\n\n\nhead to see what had happened. 4 faint nope\n\n\nglimmered in my own heart that perhaps\nthis was a device to save her life, but 1t was\n\n\nnot permitted to live long. 1t had scarcely\nbegun to rise within me, when saw the\npriming renewed, and the match ra'sea a.\ngain. The condemned wretch laid her head\nonce more on its hard pillow, and uttered a\n\n\nlow groan as if her spirit had departed. It\n\n\nhad scarcely been uttered when the eSpio-\n\n\nsion took nlace. and the smoke covered eve\nrv thing from my view. AS it gradually\nrlaarrd away, it drew veil from over a\n,, horrid and revolving spectacle. The two\n,, hodiless a rms hung, with their mangled and\nblackrncd ends, from the stakes to which\n: they had been bound; and few yards dis\ntant Law a scorched and shattered foot and\nleg. No trace of body or of head remained\nand a few tattered remnants of clothes were\n= all besides that were left. The arms were\n: unbound from the stakes; and two women\nwho had issued from the ark at the sound\nthe explosion, rushed to the spot, seized then\n\n\nup, and concealing them under their wells\nhurried to the Harem with these proofs tina\n> the demands of justice had been fulfilled\n.
