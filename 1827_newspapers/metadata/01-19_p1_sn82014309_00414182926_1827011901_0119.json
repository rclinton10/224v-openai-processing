From his manner, and his extreme destitute condition Mr. Rogers believed he wanted the arsenic for the purpose of tself-deStruction, and, therc- fore, he very humanely brought him before the alderman, in the hope that by receiv- idg some charitable relief, he might be di- vcrted from his miserable purpose.\n\n The poor fellow had no clothing, except coarse flannel shirt and very ragged can- vass trowsers, and the alderman, having eomplmented MT. Rogers, upon his hu- manity, proceeded to question the wretch ed being before him, as to who and what he was.\n\n His story was soon told-IIe was stolen was only seven years old, and sold into slavery at Rio Janeiro, where he was christened Louis Guled After some years, he was brought out of slavery by the cap- tain of an English merchant ship, and on his arrival in England he was re-christen- ed John Hampden. From that time he had been chiefly at sea-sometimes in the the royal navy. He had served on board the Mutine frigate, captain de Courcy, at the siege of Algiers after which he was turned adrift, and had ever since been wan dering about London, unable to obtain em- ployment, and \"getting more and more miserable every day\"\n\n \"Then, if you could find no employment said the alderman, how have you contri- yed to exist so long!\" :\" Sometimes l go about trying to gather few bones, he replied, holding, up a tattered bag, and if I can find enough to sell for six pence, pay four pence for my nights lodging, and spend the other two pence in food. But sometimes l can't get enough to buy me crust; and then go without food, and, lie down in the streets at night, until the watchman rouses me up from one place and drives me to another.- ] Twice have been sent to prison, three months each time, for asking for. two or three half pence, when | was so faint and hungry, that could not walk about any ! longer and in prison I have had nothing 1 but bread and water because they said l could get employment if would. i But you went to a chemists shop in cheapside, this morning-what was your object in going there' asked the alder l man.\n\n Il went for hap worth of arsenic-I had no money he replied. .....\n\n And what did you mean to do with the arsenic?'\n\n Why-if I must tell the truth, I meant to use it myself, that there might be an end to me at once. I am sick of hunger and nakedness, and of being brow beat, and put down, and imprisoned, by par eel of fellows; many of them not half so good as myself-for miserable as appear now, am gentleman, if I had my right.\n\n Alderman Crother asked him if he should like to be sent back to his own country, and he replied-' My country /: I have no country It is thirty years and more since I was stolen from my fathers house: and where am I to look for father or for friends, after thirty years! have no country mo friends-no home |: and it would be better should die out of the way.'\n\n ] The worthy alderman told him his case 1 certainly appeared worthy of much com misseration, and having pointed out to him 1 the wickedness of self destruction, he gave him couple of shillings for his immediate necessities, and directed that he should be taken care of in the Giltspur street comp ter, until something could be done for him,",

            "raw_text": "1 Moreote can read the ancient poet or histori- an with more familiarity than an Englishman can read even Chaucer, much less the Chron- lcles of the ancient Briton or the Saxon. The customs, modes of salutation, superstitiOns, sports of ancient Greece, are largely retained Tn the interior; and this strong similarity au- Jthentlcated in every color of national mind and manners, is found in the very spot which\n\n was the known and peculiar seatOf the unuol- iuted aud exclusive blood of ancient Greece. The conclusion is natural; the actual lineage that once filled the earth with its intellectual splendor, still exists, however limited; and when once it has been delivered from Its house of bondage, from the grave, which has had the power only over its form, not over its spirit, it may stand forth in some still mo- bier stature of power and genius imperisha- blc\n\n 1 The geographical formation of Greece gives us even some assurance ofthis renewed vigor From the beginning, Providence has done nothing imperfectly; it has made the people for the land and the land for the people. By the division of the finest portion of the terri tory into islands, or fragments of coast near | ly lnsular, the most curious and complete provision of which there is any example on 1 earth, was made for the perpetual excitement of the national genius. It is proof of the design of this arrangement, that nearly the whole of these matchless labours by which the Greek name lives, were achieved within sight of the sea-. The inland districts the en- tire mountain country to the north, west, and ] east were comparatively unintellectual Even where the distance was trivial what were the 1 intellectual trophies of Argolis, Laconia. or Arcadia The Islands were the original seat of all the true trumphs. Attica, itself penin- sular, and raised into sudden supremacy by the defeat of the Persians was but the bor- 1 rover from their treasures until she and her illustrious tributaries all fell under the suc- ctsssive yokcs of Sparta, Macedonia, and Rome.\n\n The singular deyeopement of ability in the Egean islands has long attracted the eye of the philosopher, and two theories have been formed for it's explanation. The one, the early freedom of their Constitutions the other, the rivalry of island with island. But neither theory, nor both put together, will solve this interesting problem. Republican, ism is not favorable to the arts. Itmay foster oratory, and the other meals of acquiring po- litical influence, hut its nature is to be narrow in its xpenditure,-inconsistan in it's patron- age,-and contemptuous of the arts. Even Athens was indebted for its noblest works to the reign of man, who held its sceptre with ESs Yet even Pericles was arraigned for the ex- penditure of public money in the Parthe- non,-Phidia perishcd in prison, and fell victim to the parsimony of a popular assem- bly,.\n\n The great patterns Of modern Italy were despots, or bodies allied to despotism. The Medci were despOts, the Popes were des- pots, the great monastic communities were | remote from all contAct with the popular spi- Tit of their day. What was the patronage of the French Republic, compared with any e. qual period ofthe reign of Louis the XIV !-- Despotsm loves luxury, and loves it in way the most inaccessible to the people-it is lav- ish, and after the first satiety of the senses, must look for it's indulgence in ornament and splendor. It expends its superhuties on fine pictures and statutes; it gratifes its own tastes by magnificent architecture and if it stoop to solicit popularity in any form, solcits by dazzling the public eye and feels some faint atonement for its public evils in the bril- liant profusion and lasting grandeur of its public memorials. This was the history of taste under the whole long line of French dcspotism, under the despots who lorded it over the nominal republics of modern Italy, under even the sluggish sun-withered, half Af- rcan sovereignty of Spain. Republicanism even in it's mildest form, is spirit of labOur, narrow equality ofmeans, ofstruggle and sus- picion, the rugged denizen ofa scanty and re- luctant soil-the genius of the spade and the sword. Despotism is the lordly and volupt- uous spirit that disdains to shake it's wings in the open air of Heaven, shape of the palace and ofthe banquet-the picture and the song; the splendid sensualist encircled by splen- dour.\n\n The mutual rivalry of the islands is not suf- fcient for the problem. There are but few evidences of general competition. The pub lie rivalry was almost totally limited to the fatal struggle ofthe sword. The only places open to the competition of the Greek blood were the games, as the Olympian and Isthy- milan. But these were notoriously, almost without exception, for manual and bodily dis play.\n\n l The real solution may be in that primitive work of nature, by which the region was di- vided into islands, in general sufficiently large | for separate governments, yet sufficiently near to make whole. Emulation is the secret of all extraordinary emineuce; and the true em- ulation is like the true tlade, internal. The separate existence of those little communities supplied sources of emulation, in which even the confgura:ion of other parts of the globe can afford no parallel. To be the first poet. ' -4- E..

It being exclusively diplomatic, and .fgmative of the various shifts and turns of diplomacy, I looked on until felt my head beginning to turn ,when ! descended into the passage, to get my cap and cloak, which l had left upon a tadle. Here l found the ''confusion worse contounded,\" sunk knec-deep in cloaks, and trod upon fine merno shawls, hats and great coats. I saw one man touzling q heap in one place, another lifting up lots in another-some turning over this parole, some that. l at last met with my cap and cloak, at opposite ends ofthe passage, they being rather of an inferior quality, to pre- vent folks from feeling too much tempted to make an exchange, and exit.\n\n *To prevent misapprehension, the Ed itors take leave to add, that the kisS that's spoken of, is the name given to species of confection.\n\n In an action for an assault x battery, it was deemed important to ascertain the size of certain stone, by which it was alledg- ed the battery was committed. For this purpose witness was called to the stand and the following brief report of his ex- animation will show how perfectly his tes- timony must have satisfied the jury.\n\n Q. Did you see the defendant throw the tone? A. I saw the stone and I am pret- ty sure D. threw it. 0. Was it stone of considerable dimensions? A. Why it was considerable of stone. Q. How large was il '? A. I should say it was a largish stone. 0. What was its size1 A. Why it was sizeable stone. Q. Can't you answer delinitely-how big was it! A. I should say it was stone of some bigness. c. You are singular witness-can't you give the jury some idea of the stone :? A. Why as near as l can recollect, it was something of stone. Q. Can't you compare it with some other ob- ject? A. Why was to compare it, so as to give my notion of the stone, I should say as near as can judge, it was about as big as a piece of chalk.-Iroy Sen.\n\n 1He Lion m the Desert.---A part of the country between Tunis and Tripoli in Africa) cannot be passed without great danger, on account of wild beasts, who fre- quently attack travellers. A Sicilian phy- sician, who performed this journey with his wife and two children, describes its horrors to us in very strong terms. He joined caravan of some thousand persons, which is the only method of passing the desert in safety. They passed gloomy and impenetrable forests, where the re- peated howlings of wild beasts, attracted by the cattle accompanying the caravan, in- creased as it drew near to their horrible dens. Sometimes the caravan was con- strained to remain several days near these woods to avoid approaching hurricanes.- No sooner were the tents pitched, and the caravan become stationary, than a pecu- liar noise in the forest announced that the wild beasts were assembling on the boar ders, waiting for favorable opportunity to rush out and seize their prey the .dread- ful roar of the lion was not heard during the day time, but when darkness came on, continued murmurs announced hlm,and his voice becoming louder and louder, broke like peaIs of thunder on the stiffness of the ",

The climate of Italy was scarcely less genial. the land less diversified, the sea less magnificent or less animating Yet the whole surviving literature of tke twelve hundred years of Rome is not equal to third of the literature of Greece during the little more than a century aid a half | from the battle of Marathon, in the year 49O before the Christian era, to the reign of Alex ander.\n\n But no due estimate can be formed of the vigor and industry, the almost preternatral energy of the Greek mind without recollect- ing under how slight stimulant it threw out its powers. It is true, that in the free repub-\n\n lies of Greece, some kinds of ability were the very wings of ambition; the soldier, the statesman, and the orator, had the noblest vision of public life glittering and expanding before them. But without the art of printing, without the general taste for reading, which has sprung up from that art, that second gift ot lHmg soul, and q speech comprehensive as the world, writing wanted vast portion of its later settlements; yet what literature of modern nations can compete with dead Greece in the multitude of her works of genius Yet have we the tenth part of these that deserved to he immortal or what have we but the. remnant snatched from the plunder of her cities, the ruin of her libraries, the utter dis persion and waste of hel fortunes Glorious and unrivalled relics of mind, more worthy of homage than all the saints of Rome, vet still but relics, sacred fragments, the scattered jewels of a magnifcence that all the wealth of later days must despair to outshine What | comparison can the literature of France, from ] the time of Francis the First, to the present | hour, from the commencement of the six teenth century to the nineteenth with all its royal patronage, with its command of pane gyric from all Europe, with it's opulent encour- agements to ability, sustain against the solita- ry literature of a land scarcely larger than one of it's provinces! What comparison can Germany, with her crowd of universities, her Ilndefatigable love of literary labor, her native vlgor of intellect, her host of authors covering | the land! What comparison can even Eng land, the land nearest to Greece in spirit and genius, with her rbomdless empire, her unspa- ring patronage, her unlimited freedom of dis cussion, her untameable mind Here the ri- valry may be tried on the largest scale; yet for our oratOry, as for all the noble public arts, for our architecture, for our sculpture for all our models of grace, beauty, grandeur, to what other shrine do We knecl than to that broken monument of glory and misfor- | tune !\n\n With this evidence of the original distinc- ton ofthe Greek mind, it becomes important to know how far the lineage has been preser- ved. It is the conclusion of the most compe- | tent travellers, that the true Greek blood has been preserved to an extraordinary degree.- The unanswerable argumentis.the permanen- cy of the language. Ofgreat changes ofpop- uation the first characteristic is tic change of language. In all the other European cOun- tries, the ancient language has been superse- ded or mingled with the foreign idiOm, until 1t has become new dialect distinct from both. In Greece we can trace the direct in- fux of strangers and settlers, by the same ev- idence, change oflanguage in their district.-- The WAllachian colony that has settled on Mount Pindus, and on the Thessalian and Ma cedonian border, is WaIlachian still, and speaks the LatiniZed dialect that is brought from Dacia. The Albanian settled in Be- tia, Attica, and Argols, has not forgotten his native dialect in two hundred years, and may retain it for ages to come. In Asia Minor, where the Turks are more numerous, the Greeks, original and settlers, have adopted a language, nearly unintelligible to the Pen insnla. Where the Thessalians have min- gled with the Albanian colonists, their Ian gtIage IS mixture of the Creek and Albani- an. The Greek of Attica bears the traces of its Italian dukes. Wherever it can be shown that the stranger had settled, there has he left his stamp upon the language; the obvious in- ference must be, that where he has not left that stamp, the ancient race still surviye.--- There is no other country of Europe in which the native is so slightly changed or so exten- siveIy spoken. The Romaic is the tongue of the whole territory that was included in Hell las, the land from the Tanarian PromontOry to Upper Macedonia, with the islands and coasts of the Egean. The distinctions be- tween the Romaic and the ancient Greek are",

            "article": "Gulldh0N.-Y esteIdry afternoon Mir. Rogers, a chemist in Cheapside, brought in poor half naked man of colour, who had just been applying to purchase some arsenic at his shop. From his manner, and his extreme destitute condition Mr. Rogers believed he wanted the arsenic for the purpose of tself-deStruction, and, therc- fore, he very humanely brought him before the alderman, in the hope that by receiv- idg some charitable relief, he might be di- vcrted from his miserable purpose.\n\n The poor fellow had no clothing, except coarse flannel shirt and very ragged can- vass trowsers, and the alderman, having eomplmented MT. Rogers, upon his hu- manity, proceeded to question the wretch ed being before him, as to who and what he was.\n\n His story was soon told-IIe was stolen was only seven years old, and sold into slavery at Rio Janeiro, where he was christened Louis Guled After some years, he was brought out of slavery by the cap- tain of an English merchant ship, and on his arrival in England he was re-christen- ed John Hampden. From that time he had been chiefly at sea-sometimes in the the royal navy. He had served on board the Mutine frigate, captain de Courcy, at the siege of Algiers after which he was turned adrift, and had ever since been wan dering about London, unable to obtain em- ployment, and \"getting more and more miserable every day\"\n\n \"Then, if you could find no employment said the alderman, how have you contri- yed to exist so long!\" :\" Sometimes l go about trying to gather few bones, he replied, holding, up a tattered bag, and if I can find enough to sell for six pence, pay four pence for my nights lodging, and spend the other two pence in food. But sometimes l can't get enough to buy me crust; and then go without food, and, lie down in the streets at night, until the watchman rouses me up from one place and drives me to another.- ] Twice have been sent to prison, three months each time, for asking for. two or three half pence, when | was so faint and hungry, that could not walk about any ! longer and in prison I have had nothing 1 but bread and water because they said l could get employment if would. i But you went to a chemists shop in cheapside, this morning-what was your object in going there' asked the alder l man.\n\n Il went for hap worth of arsenic-I had no money he replied. .....\n\n And what did you mean to do with the arsenic?'\n\n Why-if I must tell the truth, I meant to use it myself, that there might be an end to me at once. I am sick of hunger and nakedness, and of being brow beat, and put down, and imprisoned, by par eel of fellows; many of them not half so good as myself-for miserable as appear now, am gentleman, if I had my right.\n\n Alderman Crother asked him if he should like to be sent back to his own country, and he replied-' My country /: I have no country It is thirty years and more since I was stolen from my fathers house: and where am I to look for father or for friends, after thirty years! have no country mo friends-no home |: and it would be better should die out of the way.'\n\n ] The worthy alderman told him his case 1 certainly appeared worthy of much com misseration, and having pointed out to him 1 the wickedness of self destruction, he gave him couple of shillings for his immediate necessities, and directed that he should be taken care of in the Giltspur street comp ter, until something could be done for him,",

            "article": "1 Moreote can read the ancient poet or histori- an with more familiarity than an Englishman can read even Chaucer, much less the Chron- lcles of the ancient Briton or the Saxon. The customs, modes of salutation, superstitiOns, sports of ancient Greece, are largely retained Tn the interior; and this strong similarity au- Jthentlcated in every color of national mind and manners, is found in the very spot which\n\n was the known and peculiar seatOf the unuol- iuted aud exclusive blood of ancient Greece. The conclusion is natural; the actual lineage that once filled the earth with its intellectual splendor, still exists, however limited; and when once it has been delivered from Its house of bondage, from the grave, which has had the power only over its form, not over its spirit, it may stand forth in some still mo- bier stature of power and genius imperisha- blc\n\n 1 The geographical formation of Greece gives us even some assurance ofthis renewed vigor From the beginning, Providence has done nothing imperfectly; it has made the people for the land and the land for the people. By the division of the finest portion of the terri tory into islands, or fragments of coast near | ly lnsular, the most curious and complete provision of which there is any example on 1 earth, was made for the perpetual excitement of the national genius. It is proof of the design of this arrangement, that nearly the whole of these matchless labours by which the Greek name lives, were achieved within sight of the sea-. The inland districts the en- tire mountain country to the north, west, and ] east were comparatively unintellectual Even where the distance was trivial what were the 1 intellectual trophies of Argolis, Laconia. or Arcadia The Islands were the original seat of all the true trumphs. Attica, itself penin- sular, and raised into sudden supremacy by the defeat of the Persians was but the bor- 1 rover from their treasures until she and her illustrious tributaries all fell under the suc- ctsssive yokcs of Sparta, Macedonia, and Rome.\n\n The singular deyeopement of ability in the Egean islands has long attracted the eye of the philosopher, and two theories have been formed for it's explanation. The one, the early freedom of their Constitutions the other, the rivalry of island with island. But neither theory, nor both put together, will solve this interesting problem. Republican, ism is not favorable to the arts. Itmay foster oratory, and the other meals of acquiring po- litical influence, hut its nature is to be narrow in its xpenditure,-inconsistan in it's patron- age,-and contemptuous of the arts. Even Athens was indebted for its noblest works to the reign of man, who held its sceptre with ESs Yet even Pericles was arraigned for the ex- penditure of public money in the Parthe- non,-Phidia perishcd in prison, and fell victim to the parsimony of a popular assem- bly,.\n\n The great patterns Of modern Italy were despots, or bodies allied to despotism. The Medci were despOts, the Popes were des- pots, the great monastic communities were | remote from all contAct with the popular spi- Tit of their day. What was the patronage of the French Republic, compared with any e. qual period ofthe reign of Louis the XIV !-- Despotsm loves luxury, and loves it in way the most inaccessible to the people-it is lav- ish, and after the first satiety of the senses, must look for it's indulgence in ornament and splendor. It expends its superhuties on fine pictures and statutes; it gratifes its own tastes by magnificent architecture and if it stoop to solicit popularity in any form, solcits by dazzling the public eye and feels some faint atonement for its public evils in the bril- liant profusion and lasting grandeur of its public memorials. This was the history of taste under the whole long line of French dcspotism, under the despots who lorded it over the nominal republics of modern Italy, under even the sluggish sun-withered, half Af- rcan sovereignty of Spain. Republicanism even in it's mildest form, is spirit of labOur, narrow equality ofmeans, ofstruggle and sus- picion, the rugged denizen ofa scanty and re- luctant soil-the genius of the spade and the sword. Despotism is the lordly and volupt- uous spirit that disdains to shake it's wings in the open air of Heaven, shape of the palace and ofthe banquet-the picture and the song; the splendid sensualist encircled by splen- dour.\n\n The mutual rivalry of the islands is not suf- fcient for the problem. There are but few evidences of general competition. The pub lie rivalry was almost totally limited to the fatal struggle ofthe sword. The only places open to the competition of the Greek blood were the games, as the Olympian and Isthy- milan. But these were notoriously, almost without exception, for manual and bodily dis play.\n\n l The real solution may be in that primitive work of nature, by which the region was di- vided into islands, in general sufficiently large | for separate governments, yet sufficiently near to make whole. Emulation is the secret of all extraordinary emineuce; and the true em- ulation is like the true tlade, internal. The separate existence of those little communities supplied sources of emulation, in which even the confgura:ion of other parts of the globe can afford no parallel. To be the first poet. ' -4- E..

But without the art of printing, without the general taste for reading, which has sprung up from that art, that second gift ot lHmg soul, and q speech comprehensive as the world, writing wanted vast portion of its later settlements; yet what literature of modern nations can compete with dead Greece in the multitude of her works of genius Yet have we the tenth part of these that deserved to he immortal or what have we but the. remnant snatched from the plunder of her cities, the ruin of her libraries, the utter dis persion and waste of hel fortunes Glorious and unrivalled relics of mind, more worthy of homage than all the saints of Rome, vet still but relics, sacred fragments, the scattered jewels of a magnifcence that all the wealth of later days must despair to outshine What | comparison can the literature of France, from ] the time of Francis the First, to the present | hour, from the commencement of the six teenth century to the nineteenth with all its royal patronage, with its command of pane gyric from all Europe, with it's opulent encour- agements to ability, sustain against the solita- ry literature of a land scarcely larger than one of it's provinces! What comparison can Germany, with her crowd of universities, her Ilndefatigable love of literary labor, her native vlgor of intellect, her host of authors covering | the land! What comparison can even Eng land, the land nearest to Greece in spirit and genius, with her rbomdless empire, her unspa- ring patronage, her unlimited freedom of dis cussion, her untameable mind Here the ri- valry may be tried on the largest scale; yet for our oratOry, as for all the noble public arts, for our architecture, for our sculpture for all our models of grace, beauty, grandeur, to what other shrine do We knecl than to that broken monument of glory and misfor- | tune !\n\n With this evidence of the original distinc- ton ofthe Greek mind, it becomes important to know how far the lineage has been preser- ved. It is the conclusion of the most compe- | tent travellers, that the true Greek blood has been preserved to an extraordinary degree.- The unanswerable argumentis.the permanen- cy of the language. Ofgreat changes ofpop- uation the first characteristic is tic change of language. In all the other European cOun- tries, the ancient language has been superse- ded or mingled with the foreign idiOm, until 1t has become new dialect distinct from both. In Greece we can trace the direct in- fux of strangers and settlers, by the same ev- idence, change oflanguage in their district.-- The WAllachian colony that has settled on Mount Pindus, and on the Thessalian and Ma cedonian border, is WaIlachian still, and speaks the LatiniZed dialect that is brought from Dacia. The Albanian settled in Be- tia, Attica, and Argols, has not forgotten his native dialect in two hundred years, and may retain it for ages to come. In Asia Minor, where the Turks are more numerous, the Greeks, original and settlers, have adopted a language, nearly unintelligible to the Pen insnla. Where the Thessalians have min- gled with the Albanian colonists, their Ian gtIage IS mixture of the Creek and Albani- an. The Greek of Attica bears the traces of its Italian dukes. Wherever it can be shown that the stranger had settled, there has he left his stamp upon the language; the obvious in- ference must be, that where he has not left that stamp, the ancient race still surviye.--- There is no other country of Europe in which the native is so slightly changed or so exten- siveIy spoken. The Romaic is the tongue of the whole territory that was included in Hell las, the land from the Tanarian PromontOry to Upper Macedonia, with the islands and coasts of the Egean. The distinctions be- tween the Romaic and the ancient Greek are",

The silver tones of fwoman's tongue, The eloquence of womaa's eyes, A thousand nameless bards have sung, The strains unheeded by the wise; l would not be bard like them Even for the heaven of Lucy's smile, And Lucy would herself condemn The Aatterer's deceitful vile. Icould not tell thee how love, Nor paint the charms find in thee, Though every leaf in yonder grove Changed into winged words for me; But, Lucy! to this heart of mine : Let me thy gentle fingers press,-- Each rapid bounding throb is thine, And every thrOb is happiness. Lucy it is the holy hour\n\n When sunlight dies upon the sea When pearls are hung on nevery flower, And birds are b,lsh'd on every tree: Open the lattice--ai is mute, Mute as the beams on yon pale star; would not even have thy lute The music of such silence mar. Mehlnks there is in it a spell\n\n That gives the soul a higher sway, And thoughts that oft ir darkness dwell, Start into life in bright array Though ughts-feelings- -ecstacies-that fling A sudden joy through both our bosoms, Like flowers in moonlight, or like spring That wreaths on every bough her blos-\n\n sOms.\n\n Each others world we long have been, Our eyes their sun--nur arms their zone, But now something felt--not seen Gives to our bliss higher tone: While We can clasp each other thus, In loves deep purity entwinod, On! what IS all this earth to us !-- Earth cannot bound the chainless mind !! Our souls, like clouds at break ofday, Across the suns bright pathway driven, Have into light resolved away OGod! the light-the light of Heaven l! My spirit floats in liquid light Like skif upon sapphire sea. o Lucy we have seen tonight A glimpse of Heavens eternity! Lucy 1t IS a time for prayer A time for thoughts we cannot speak, - But in the blue and starry air seek i; Our thoughts will find the home they Kneel with me, Lucy, side by side We are not things of dust and clay, Thou art my own immortal hride,- Kneel with me, dearest.-we will pray.",
