OF\n! Gen Jackson, Mr. Jefferson often said, that\nhe was an honest, sincere, firm, clcar-hrad-\n\n\ned aud strong minded man, OF the soundesl\n\n\npolitical principles. which he knew we'll\n\n\nfrom having observed his conduct while d\n\n\nSenator Of the United States. when he wa:\n\n\nVice President himself. He had no doubt\n\n\nthat il en- Jackson should be brought into\nOffice 10 correct the alarming tendency To\nwards formidable, and otherwise lrremedla\nBILE evils, beginning to devclope itself in III,\nadministration of the General Government\nhe feouM he entirely faiMfnifo Mat otjert\n: This conversation took place either imme\ndiately after the Convention in Staunton o\n1925, or in December following; and it wa\nthe last free expression OF his sentiments\never heard: calamitous change IN the pri\n\n\nvate affairs of both having occurred shortl,\nafter, which prevented my being much will\n: him, by placing him through impcrious cir\nJ cumstances, in situation requiring him 4\n. be unfriendly to my greatest interests.\n\n\nHaving been an elector myself in 1894\ny when Mr..

Adams\n$ from the year 1892, without Acknowledge\nthat he was an able, learned, and homes\nt man, to which he often added, before til\nd period mentioned, that Mr.. Adams woul\nq make safe Chief Magistrate of the Uniol\n: and was the most fit of all the New Eng\nS land men. Towards Mr. Clay as polit\nq clan, MIR.
