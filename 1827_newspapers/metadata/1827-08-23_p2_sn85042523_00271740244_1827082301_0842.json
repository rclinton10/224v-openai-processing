Then we\nbelieve that they will know for themselves\nef fIis great goodness: and as they continue,\nfrom time to time, protiting by what they\nmay learn of the way of salvation, but not\ntrusting to it, they will partake of that living\nbread which cometh down from heayen;---\nthey will drink of those living waters which\nnourish the soul unto eternal lite. This\ncourse CT Christian experience we earnestly\ndesire for every one amongst us. 1t is an\n| individual work; but it is indispensable for\n| all. 1t may often be SLOW IN ITS progress,\nbut it is certain in its effects; and amongst\nthe blsssed consequences which it produces,\n\n\nwe come to have an establishment in Christ,\nresulting not from any speculative system OF\nbelief, but from heartfelt acquaintance\n\n\nwith His power inwardly revealed to the\n\n\nseul. When assailed by false doctrines, OF\n\n\nwhen in the support of our views of Chris\n\n\ntim practice, trials are our portion, knowing\n\n\nin whom we have believed, we can look in\n4 humble, but firm reliance unto Him.

Then we\nbelieve that they will know for themselves\nef fIis great goodness: and as they continue,\nfrom time to time, protiting by what they\nmay learn of the way of salvation, but not\ntrusting to it, they will partake of that living\nbread which cometh down from heayen;---\nthey will drink of those living waters which\nnourish the soul unto eternal lite. This\ncourse CT Christian experience we earnestly\ndesire for every one amongst us. 1t is an\n| individual work; but it is indispensable for\n| all. 1t may often be SLOW IN ITS progress,\nbut it is certain in its effects; and amongst\nthe blsssed consequences which it produces,\n\n\nwe come to have an establishment in Christ,\nresulting not from any speculative system OF\nbelief, but from heartfelt acquaintance\n\n\nwith His power inwardly revealed to the\n\n\nseul. When assailed by false doctrines, OF\n\n\nwhen in the support of our views of Chris\n\n\ntim practice, trials are our portion, knowing\n\n\nin whom we have believed, we can look in\n4 humble, but firm reliance unto Him.
