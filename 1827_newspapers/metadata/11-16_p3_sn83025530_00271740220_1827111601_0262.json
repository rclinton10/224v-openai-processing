Such was his especial business\nand such the cherished hope of the Combination.\nMartin Van Buren is one of that small number Of\nmen, who must bid adieu to all hope of future poll\ntical advancement, unless there can be brought\nabout complete revouton--a total prostration of\n' the Administration. Unless the men in power\ncan be ruined by some means, two or three would be\npresidents must be forever disappointed. The prize\n. is great and it must be obtained soon, or never\n\n\nMartin and his Argus had denounced General\nJackson, like other men and papers of the same\ncharacter but that was not to be considered.\nwhen it was discovered that the best chance of de-\nsroyng the Administration and creating vacancy\nin few years was in supporting General Jackson\nI that was the only chance Of success, the hazzard\nOf any revolution caused by the election of the Ge\nneral was not to be regarded.\n\n\n1t was seen that the General already had the sup\nport of large portion of the community. from va\nous causes, not very creditable to their understand\nNO and intelligence in some cases, to their pa\nrotism in others. But it was too well known that\nne could not succeed as the first choice Of the Ame\nrcan people and hence the absolute necessity of\nemploying organization prosttuted presses and po-\niticans, and using all means, fair and foul. to de-\ngrade the Administration, SO that majority of the\n\n\n\n\n\nchoice of eyils.H Hence we have had tale after\nale the establishment of new presses the zeal of\nhose prostitutes in Virginia, Delaware. and New\nYork and the labors of those second rate asprants\nwho have slight hopes of advancement under the\npresent order of things.\n\n\nIf the Van Buren majority in the New York Le-\nEisature--caIeh sonan---chuose to take away\nThe power of the people to vote by districts for the\npresident, they may gain something for the moment;\nbut such course will most assuredly ruin Mr.. Van\nBurcn's ulterior projects.\n\n\nBesdes-supposing we allow all that the Jackso-\nnians claim in Newly orl--which we very far\nfrom doing--the signs of the times clearly indicate\nthat Virginia will not be counted on the side of the\n&opposton. Suppose Jackson avowedly hostile to\nthe American system, he would be hard pushed ir\nVirginia, and would probably loose all the state;\nNorth Of the Potomac If he were as decidedly il\nfavor Of the American System as the present Ad\nnnistraton, what has Virginia to gain by the change\nN that score, and what have the people north 0\n'he Potomac, seeing more fully, by and by, the rea\nohjccts Of the aspirants, to hope from a change 0\nmen?\n\n\nThus, therefore, when Mr..

Unless the men in power\ncan be ruined by some means, two or three would be\npresidents must be forever disappointed. The prize\n. is great and it must be obtained soon, or never\n\n\nMartin and his Argus had denounced General\nJackson, like other men and papers of the same\ncharacter but that was not to be considered.\nwhen it was discovered that the best chance of de-\nsroyng the Administration and creating vacancy\nin few years was in supporting General Jackson\nI that was the only chance Of success, the hazzard\nOf any revolution caused by the election of the Ge\nneral was not to be regarded.\n\n\n1t was seen that the General already had the sup\nport of large portion of the community. from va\nous causes, not very creditable to their understand\nNO and intelligence in some cases, to their pa\nrotism in others. But it was too well known that\nne could not succeed as the first choice Of the Ame\nrcan people and hence the absolute necessity of\nemploying organization prosttuted presses and po-\niticans, and using all means, fair and foul. to de-\ngrade the Administration, SO that majority of the\n\n\n\n\n\nchoice of eyils.H Hence we have had tale after\nale the establishment of new presses the zeal of\nhose prostitutes in Virginia, Delaware. and New\nYork and the labors of those second rate asprants\nwho have slight hopes of advancement under the\npresent order of things.\n\n\nIf the Van Buren majority in the New York Le-\nEisature--caIeh sonan---chuose to take away\nThe power of the people to vote by districts for the\npresident, they may gain something for the moment;\nbut such course will most assuredly ruin Mr.. Van\nBurcn's ulterior projects.\n\n\nBesdes-supposing we allow all that the Jackso-\nnians claim in Newly orl--which we very far\nfrom doing--the signs of the times clearly indicate\nthat Virginia will not be counted on the side of the\n&opposton. Suppose Jackson avowedly hostile to\nthe American system, he would be hard pushed ir\nVirginia, and would probably loose all the state;\nNorth Of the Potomac If he were as decidedly il\nfavor Of the American System as the present Ad\nnnistraton, what has Virginia to gain by the change\nN that score, and what have the people north 0\n'he Potomac, seeing more fully, by and by, the rea\nohjccts Of the aspirants, to hope from a change 0\nmen?\n\n\nThus, therefore, when Mr..
