But where the scriptures are plain, or the practices of christians uniform, we have felt, and still feel. at liberty to speak with freedom, although we are opposed by the prejudices of the people, and the practices of the profigate.\n\n We have incucated on the ceiefs not only the common duties of morality, but we have also taught them that he who ruleth must he just ruling in the fear of the Lord; and have endeavOured to convince them that they are set for the punshme mt of evil dOers, and for the praise of them that do well. We have given them general principles derived from the word of God, together with script ure ex amples of their application and when these have not been clearly understood, and they have asked further explanations, we have sometimes referred them to modern examples in christian nations. We have thus pursued one undeviated course, neither withholding instruction, nor interfering with their author ity as rulers of the land.\n\n We have not been blind to their defects, by which they have sometimes screened the guilty from deserved punishment, neglected their promises, and even encouraged iniquity. We have sometimes too known of their chil dish, i'll timed and improper punishment, and more improper threats. But while we have with sorrow witnessed these things, we have also felt, that should we interfere with direct and positive remonstrances and advice, we should not only go beyond the limits of our instructions, but should also incur the dis pleasure, both of the rulers themselves, and also of all those who are witnesses of our dp- crations.\n\n While we have thus been endeayouring, both from the scriptures and the example of pious kings,to point out to the chiefs their du- ty Gs rulers, we have also endeavoured from the same authorities, to inculcate on the people their duties as subjects. We have taught them that they ''must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience's sake,\" rendering to all their dues.' We have also distinctly held up the doctrine of the apostles, \"that if any did not work neither should he eat\"\n\n We have to all both chiefs and people, in- sisted not only on belief of the doctrines, but also obedience to the precepts of the bi- ble, including justice, honestA, integrity, pune tualisy, truth. purity, good order, union, kind ness and peaee.-These we have always told them, are signs of good heart and evidence ofa preparation for heaven. We appeal to all our candid observers, and to an enIlghten- ed public, whether the objects accomplished are not worthy the exertions we have made\n\n Is it nothing that the vices of the drunk ard and the gambler, with which the land was formerly almost overrun, should now be lm ited, to a comparatively small number !-that She observance of the sabbath should be al most universal !-that schools should be es- fablished in every part of the islands, and be attended by 25.OOO scholars among whom have been circulated more than 40, 900 tracts, containing various texts of scripture besides the decalogue, and all intoxicating the duties mentioned above Is it nothing that nearly all the chiefs and leading persons on the isl ands, and many others too, should be taught to read and write so as to correspond by let ter ? ls!t nothing that thousands who former iy devoted their time to gaming, quarreilng. and the practice of iniquity in all it's varied forms: and the thousands who wasted f eir days in idleness, should now be assembled in schools, and spend their leisure time ID read ing scripture tracts, and listening to nstruc- tion [? Is 1t nothing that number of leading persons in nation, as well as several others of lower rank, should publicly declare their belief m the doctrines. and render obedience to the precepts of the bible If all this is mo- thing, then we confess that our labors have been vain, and our object is proved unwor- thy the patronage of the wise or even of the benevolent.\n\n While we allude to these changes, we are far from being blind or indifferent to the bar barism, fickleness, duplicity. neglect, laziness, and other varied vices and crimes, which to some extent still remain, and which are more or less visible even to transient visiter; nei- ther do we vindicate or in the least degree offer paliatIon for these things. We only complain and remonstrate against these H. liberal and unmanly charges, by which the mission IS made accountable for the daily blunders, the childish actions. the long estab- lshed customs, and even the inheritent depra vity of the people; and all forsooth because we attempt to make them better.\n\n If the doctrines and duties of christianity in which the church of England, the church of Scotland, the Presbyterian and other churches Tn America are agreed, are not a. dapted to correct the evils which exist in hea then nations ;-if these doctrines and duties, when faithfully taught by precept and exam pie, have no good influence to cure the hu- man heart, and to promote virtue, order and happiness in society, then the missionary, ,and the Philanthropist too, may sit down togeth- CT in dlspair, and pronounce the evils among heathens incurable for if these fail, we may VNn1 !

This threat had the desired effect. The two assemblies have decided to re-assemble at ParOs-The most obstinate chiefs have consented to aban- don (at least for the mOment) their preten- ! sions and all misunderstanding has ceased On the 24th March, very bloody affair Oc- cured before Athens. Karaiskaki has been slightly wounded in the forehead. An i'm pOrtant position was carried by the Greeks. On the 24th March, in the evening, Lord Cochrane departed from Egina, with Tom bas, accompanied by four other vessels. On the 25th the steam boat came to take sup ply of coals for 25 days. Miaulis has receiy- ed an order to reiOin Lord COchrane with 9 other vessels.--The expedition IS secret. Some of the sailors imagine that it is direct ed against Alexandria, others agaist Candia. The vessel of Capt. Alfnate, sent from Leg horn, arrived on the 23d of March, at Egina. She carried 5000 balls, 100 barrels of pow der and l2O mil4ters of flour. A portion of these stores have been embarked on board the vessels forming the secret expedition. - Lord Cochrane has communicated to Kara ! iskaki, that if the siege of Athens was not raised on the 18th of April, he himself shonId make disposition to succor the beseiged, and attack the Turks. Miaulis and Tombasi have written to M. Eynard, to the effect that they would do all in their power to assist Lord Cochrane, and they asked nothing but to serve under his orders. General Church was setting out to join Karaskaki.\n\n 'All the Greek newspapers, and particular \" that published at Hydra, are filled with joy at the arrival of Lord Cochrane. The re-es- tablshment ofFabvier is confirmed\" Smyrna, April 1S-ln order to put a stop to the many piracies which ruined commerce and navigation, the commanders of the En- 1 gIish, French, and Austrian squadrons have agreed together to determine in what places and channels ships belonging to these squad rOns shall constantly cruise.\n\n French Army in Spain.-Orders have been issued by the minister of War for the Army of Observation to retrograde to the same dis tance from the frontiers as the armies of Eng land and Portugal are at present posted. These orders have been the result of the complaints made by Mir. Lamb to M. Lima, 1 with respect to the movements in advance of our army, which appeared to have no other object than to support the insurrection of FL { vas and extend t to other places on the from tiers of Port agal-Lon. Com.\n\n Insurrectioe in one Of tue Burn,Gn Provinces Our English papers, furnish us with an ac- count of this insurrection from which we de- rive the following facts: Hostilites, at the last dates were in active progress. The Taens had gained an advantage, but not so decided one as was at first supposed. In the begin ing of December, the Governor of the Man taban district had sent 700 men to aid the Viceroy at Rangoon, and these. with 700 of his troops, marched to Syria strongly stock aded town. A division it burnt Kemmen- dine. as yell as the suburb of Takali, and 800 boats. A strong party of Taliens occu- pied strong position near the town, at the last dates. The Pegu colors were hoisted at DalIa.\n\n The salary paid to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland every wear is 97.O0Oi. and the salary and fees paid to his Chief Secretary amOnnt to about 60O0l.\n\n The National Debt of Great Britain now amounts to eight hundred and ninety seven millions.\n\n PoLGr Erpedition.-Early in April, 1897, Captain Parry embarked in the HeckIa, for the purpose ofagain attempting to reach the North Pole. The NavigatOrs proceed to Hammerfest in Norway, where some rein deer will be provided for them to assist in drawing the boats on the ice when they are used as sledges. Upon the arrival of the Hecla at Spitzbergen, after securing her firm ly, she will be left to the charge of a lieuten- ant &c. The expeditions, into which the rest of the officers, and the crew are to be divided. will then start on their adventur- ous routes. The first, which is to proceed direct for the North Pole, is to consist of two parties ten men eaclfsand two officers, in two boats, which may be used on the ice with wheels or as sledges. The second division is under Lieutenant Foster, R. N., an officer of great scientific attainments it is his intcn- ton, if possible to sail around Sptzbergen. It having been correctly ascertained to be an island he will lay down the exact portions of the different bearings and make many astro- nomical observations and experiments in magnetism. The adventure thus far exceeds in boldness. any thing which Captain Parry has yet undertaken. It is calculated that he will have to travel little less than 1000 miles,pro- vided he and his companions reach the pole, carrying with them the whole of their neces- sares. Should the vessel be able to penetrate to eighty degrees, it would be 500 miles in a straight line to the Pole, which 1t is not prob able they could pursue, as they must be con stantly making detours, to avoid mountains of ice, or perhaps land. They are however almost sanguine ofsuccess, and expect to re-\n\n \\ A",

            "article": "When we have been requested by the chiefs or people to give instructions or advice, we have uniformly and perseveringly withheld it on all points where we could not refer the decision of the question either to the scrip lures, or to the uniform practices of christian nations. But where the scriptures are plain, or the practices of christians uniform, we have felt, and still feel. at liberty to speak with freedom, although we are opposed by the prejudices of the people, and the practices of the profigate.\n\n We have incucated on the ceiefs not only the common duties of morality, but we have also taught them that he who ruleth must he just ruling in the fear of the Lord; and have endeavOured to convince them that they are set for the punshme mt of evil dOers, and for the praise of them that do well. We have given them general principles derived from the word of God, together with script ure ex amples of their application and when these have not been clearly understood, and they have asked further explanations, we have sometimes referred them to modern examples in christian nations. We have thus pursued one undeviated course, neither withholding instruction, nor interfering with their author ity as rulers of the land.\n\n We have not been blind to their defects, by which they have sometimes screened the guilty from deserved punishment, neglected their promises, and even encouraged iniquity. We have sometimes too known of their chil dish, i'll timed and improper punishment, and more improper threats. But while we have with sorrow witnessed these things, we have also felt, that should we interfere with direct and positive remonstrances and advice, we should not only go beyond the limits of our instructions, but should also incur the dis pleasure, both of the rulers themselves, and also of all those who are witnesses of our dp- crations.\n\n While we have thus been endeayouring, both from the scriptures and the example of pious kings,to point out to the chiefs their du- ty Gs rulers, we have also endeavoured from the same authorities, to inculcate on the people their duties as subjects. We have taught them that they ''must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience's sake,\" rendering to all their dues.' We have also distinctly held up the doctrine of the apostles, \"that if any did not work neither should he eat\"\n\n We have to all both chiefs and people, in- sisted not only on belief of the doctrines, but also obedience to the precepts of the bi- ble, including justice, honestA, integrity, pune tualisy, truth. purity, good order, union, kind ness and peaee.-These we have always told them, are signs of good heart and evidence ofa preparation for heaven. We appeal to all our candid observers, and to an enIlghten- ed public, whether the objects accomplished are not worthy the exertions we have made\n\n Is it nothing that the vices of the drunk ard and the gambler, with which the land was formerly almost overrun, should now be lm ited, to a comparatively small number !-that She observance of the sabbath should be al most universal !-that schools should be es- fablished in every part of the islands, and be attended by 25.OOO scholars among whom have been circulated more than 40, 900 tracts, containing various texts of scripture besides the decalogue, and all intoxicating the duties mentioned above Is it nothing that nearly all the chiefs and leading persons on the isl ands, and many others too, should be taught to read and write so as to correspond by let ter ? ls!t nothing that thousands who former iy devoted their time to gaming, quarreilng. and the practice of iniquity in all it's varied forms: and the thousands who wasted f eir days in idleness, should now be assembled in schools, and spend their leisure time ID read ing scripture tracts, and listening to nstruc- tion [? Is 1t nothing that number of leading persons in nation, as well as several others of lower rank, should publicly declare their belief m the doctrines. and render obedience to the precepts of the bible If all this is mo- thing, then we confess that our labors have been vain, and our object is proved unwor- thy the patronage of the wise or even of the benevolent.\n\n While we allude to these changes, we are far from being blind or indifferent to the bar barism, fickleness, duplicity. neglect, laziness, and other varied vices and crimes, which to some extent still remain, and which are more or less visible even to transient visiter; nei- ther do we vindicate or in the least degree offer paliatIon for these things. We only complain and remonstrate against these H. liberal and unmanly charges, by which the mission IS made accountable for the daily blunders, the childish actions. the long estab- lshed customs, and even the inheritent depra vity of the people; and all forsooth because we attempt to make them better.\n\n If the doctrines and duties of christianity in which the church of England, the church of Scotland, the Presbyterian and other churches Tn America are agreed, are not a. dapted to correct the evils which exist in hea then nations ;-if these doctrines and duties, when faithfully taught by precept and exam pie, have no good influence to cure the hu- man heart, and to promote virtue, order and happiness in society, then the missionary, ,and the Philanthropist too, may sit down togeth- CT in dlspair, and pronounce the evils among heathens incurable for if these fail, we may VNn1 !

This threat had the desired effect. The two assemblies have decided to re-assemble at ParOs-The most obstinate chiefs have consented to aban- don (at least for the mOment) their preten- ! sions and all misunderstanding has ceased On the 24th March, very bloody affair Oc- cured before Athens. Karaiskaki has been slightly wounded in the forehead. An i'm pOrtant position was carried by the Greeks. On the 24th March, in the evening, Lord Cochrane departed from Egina, with Tom bas, accompanied by four other vessels. On the 25th the steam boat came to take sup ply of coals for 25 days. Miaulis has receiy- ed an order to reiOin Lord COchrane with 9 other vessels.--The expedition IS secret. Some of the sailors imagine that it is direct ed against Alexandria, others agaist Candia. The vessel of Capt. Alfnate, sent from Leg horn, arrived on the 23d of March, at Egina. She carried 5000 balls, 100 barrels of pow der and l2O mil4ters of flour. A portion of these stores have been embarked on board the vessels forming the secret expedition. - Lord Cochrane has communicated to Kara ! iskaki, that if the siege of Athens was not raised on the 18th of April, he himself shonId make disposition to succor the beseiged, and attack the Turks. Miaulis and Tombasi have written to M. Eynard, to the effect that they would do all in their power to assist Lord Cochrane, and they asked nothing but to serve under his orders. General Church was setting out to join Karaskaki.\n\n 'All the Greek newspapers, and particular \" that published at Hydra, are filled with joy at the arrival of Lord Cochrane. The re-es- tablshment ofFabvier is confirmed\" Smyrna, April 1S-ln order to put a stop to the many piracies which ruined commerce and navigation, the commanders of the En- 1 gIish, French, and Austrian squadrons have agreed together to determine in what places and channels ships belonging to these squad rOns shall constantly cruise.\n\n French Army in Spain.-Orders have been issued by the minister of War for the Army of Observation to retrograde to the same dis tance from the frontiers as the armies of Eng land and Portugal are at present posted. These orders have been the result of the complaints made by Mir. Lamb to M. Lima, 1 with respect to the movements in advance of our army, which appeared to have no other object than to support the insurrection of FL { vas and extend t to other places on the from tiers of Port agal-Lon. Com.\n\n Insurrectioe in one Of tue Burn,Gn Provinces Our English papers, furnish us with an ac- count of this insurrection from which we de- rive the following facts: Hostilites, at the last dates were in active progress. The Taens had gained an advantage, but not so decided one as was at first supposed. In the begin ing of December, the Governor of the Man taban district had sent 700 men to aid the Viceroy at Rangoon, and these. with 700 of his troops, marched to Syria strongly stock aded town. A division it burnt Kemmen- dine. as yell as the suburb of Takali, and 800 boats. A strong party of Taliens occu- pied strong position near the town, at the last dates. The Pegu colors were hoisted at DalIa.\n\n The salary paid to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland every wear is 97.O0Oi. and the salary and fees paid to his Chief Secretary amOnnt to about 60O0l.\n\n The National Debt of Great Britain now amounts to eight hundred and ninety seven millions.\n\n PoLGr Erpedition.-Early in April, 1897, Captain Parry embarked in the HeckIa, for the purpose ofagain attempting to reach the North Pole. The NavigatOrs proceed to Hammerfest in Norway, where some rein deer will be provided for them to assist in drawing the boats on the ice when they are used as sledges. Upon the arrival of the Hecla at Spitzbergen, after securing her firm ly, she will be left to the charge of a lieuten- ant &c. The expeditions, into which the rest of the officers, and the crew are to be divided. will then start on their adventur- ous routes. The first, which is to proceed direct for the North Pole, is to consist of two parties ten men eaclfsand two officers, in two boats, which may be used on the ice with wheels or as sledges. The second division is under Lieutenant Foster, R. N., an officer of great scientific attainments it is his intcn- ton, if possible to sail around Sptzbergen. It having been correctly ascertained to be an island he will lay down the exact portions of the different bearings and make many astro- nomical observations and experiments in magnetism. The adventure thus far exceeds in boldness. any thing which Captain Parry has yet undertaken. It is calculated that he will have to travel little less than 1000 miles,pro- vided he and his companions reach the pole, carrying with them the whole of their neces- sares. Should the vessel be able to penetrate to eighty degrees, it would be 500 miles in a straight line to the Pole, which 1t is not prob able they could pursue, as they must be con stantly making detours, to avoid mountains of ice, or perhaps land. They are however almost sanguine ofsuccess, and expect to re-\n\n \\ A",
