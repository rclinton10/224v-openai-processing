The party Immediately pressed\nfor the attack, and now commenced the\nsport. The elephants, upon receiving the\n\n\nfirst shot as ifby mutual consent, gave chase\nthough not tor above six or seven hundred\nyards. This answered the desired effect.\nOne of the party galloped between the ele\nplants and the bush, which they had just left\ncommencing, at the same time, heavy fire.\nwhich harrassed them to such degree, that\nthey fed 10 the plains, leaving behind them\n\n\nthick cover, in which they might have been\nperfectly secure from the shots.

The CATERS do the same thing when\n\n\nthey have been shot-that is, tear up hand\nfull ofgrass and thurst it into the wounded\nplace; and it is thought they have learnt this\n\n\nfrom seeing the elephants do it.-At length\nthe great bull dropped. The party then en-\n\n\ntered the bush, and to their great surprise,\n| found that the reason he would not leave\n\n\nthis spot, was, that he had there found\n\n\npool of water, with which he had been was\n\n\ning his wounds.

The bull ell\nephant, called back by the cry of his young,\nagain appeared, but totally different in as\nquicker, his eyes fierce, his trunk elevated,\nand his head appeared three times the size,\nNV friend called to the Hottentot to look,\nand he Immediately replied in broken Eng\nlish, Eyes, Mynheer, dat is dc elephant will\nmake mems dead\" The alarm was extreme,\nbut while the animal stood hesitating, the\ncry Of the young sounded from distant quar-\nter, and the enraged father tosk the short\nest cut towards them, crushing the branches\nas he stalked along; and the party thus most\nprovidentially escaped. 1t was ascertained\nthat the elephant had made off towards the\nsea.\n\n\nThey went up to the dead elephant, mere\nly to examine it; tor the Hottentots leave\nthe tusks till the flesh becomes softened, as\nit would take up too much time to separate\nthem. One of these men took cut his knife,\nand cut circular piece off the head, about\nan inch deep; he then pointed out dark spot\nsimilar to what is called the kernal in beef,\nthis he probed with his knife, and brought\n\n\nout small part of tz9ig, but it was broken.\n| He distributed little piece as great favor\n\n\nthen carefully wrapt the remainder up, as\n\n\nthey have an idea that whoever wears it.\n\n\ncan never be killed by an elephant, and this\nvaluable charm was transferred by my\nfriend TO me. 1t is remarkable that no nat\nuralist has ever noticed this circumstance\n\n\nThere is no outward appearance. and it is\nimpossible to imagine how it becomes enc\nclosed, CT of what use it is to the animal.\nThey set off, party of fourteen in num-\nher, and found upwards Of three score ele-\nplants encamped on the banks of the Kou-\nnap river. 1t was late when the party are\nrived, therefore an attempt would have\nbeen useless and dangerous. Large fires\nwere lighted to keep off lions as we'll as ele-\nphants. and the party being much fatigueds\nthey lay down and slept.\n\n\nThe elephants awokc them early with\nbreaking and pulling up trees by the roots,\nand rolling themselves in the wa\nter, &c. The party Immediately pressed\nfor the attack, and now commenced the\nsport. The elephants, upon receiving the\n\n\nfirst shot as ifby mutual consent, gave chase\nthough not tor above six or seven hundred\nyards. This answered the desired effect.\nOne of the party galloped between the ele\nplants and the bush, which they had just left\ncommencing, at the same time, heavy fire.\nwhich harrassed them to such degree, that\nthey fed 10 the plains, leaving behind them\n\n\nthick cover, in which they might have been\nperfectly secure from the shots. On those\n| plains great numbers of small bushes are\n! found at no great distance from each other,\n50 that il one party consents to drive the ell\nephant out of one bush, the other will con-\nceal themselves, and by this means may &c.\n\n\nsome good shots.\n\n\nOne large bull elephant stationed himself\n| in the middle of one of these small bushes;\n\n\nand at least two hundred rounds were fred\n\n\nwithout being able to bring him down. or\nmake him move form the place in which he\n\n\nhad stationed himself. At every shot he\n\n\nreceived he was supposed to blow quantity\n\n\nOf water into the wound, and then tear up q\nlarge lump of earth to endeavor to stop the\nblood. The CATERS do the same thing when\n\n\nthey have been shot-that is, tear up hand\nfull ofgrass and thurst it into the wounded\nplace; and it is thought they have learnt this\n\n\nfrom seeing the elephants do it.-At length\nthe great bull dropped. The party then en-\n\n\ntered the bush, and to their great surprise,\n| found that the reason he would not leave\n\n\nthis spot, was, that he had there found\n\n\npool of water, with which he had been was\n\n\ning his wounds.
