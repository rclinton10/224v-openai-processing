In climate so variable as ours, W here the changes of the weather are frequently sudden and unexpected, it requires more care and attention to guard against this dangerous enemy of life, than most people imagine, or are able and willing to bestow. The bills of mortality exhibit the melancholy fact that the proportion of deaths by this disease may be c. nsidered as about five to one. Inasmuch then as this fatal disease bids defiance to the skill of the most learned physicians, it is qualification to the proprietor that he is ena- bled to offer to those afflicted with it good- ly prospect of relief in that highly valuable remedy the Vegetable I,diass Specifc.-The Indians are happy in their knowledge of med ical plants; governed wholly by experience, they are certain as to their effect, and it is said by an author of great character. that a true consumption is disease never known among them.\n\n For the information of those afflicted with complaints. of the breast and lungs, the pro- prietor inserts ffrOm among the numerous tes- timoniais in his possession) the following cer- tifcate\n\n Baltimore, 7th Dee. 1924.\n\n l, W. PRICE, of the city of Baltimore, dc hereby certify and declare, that was for long time afflicted with severe cold, accom- panied with an almost incessant cough, and pain in my breast and lungs; also splitting of blood and purulent matter from the lungs. with night sweats and levers, and was much emaciated by the loss of appetite, rest, S1c. ] applied to several eminent physicians, and passed through a course of medicine, but could obtain no relief and found myself fast vcrging on to a confirmed consumption. Hav- ing at length heard of the many astonishing cares affected by the Vegetabie Indian Specif- sc, was induced to make trial of it, and found almost immediate relief, and my rest restored. continued its use, improving fast, my appe- tite better, and all the symptoms of the di- sease daily diminishing, and in a few weeks was completely cured, and have remained so for several months, and am now in better health and flesh than I have been for many years. therefore with confidence, rccoul- mend the use of the Vegetable Indian Specif iC to all who suffer under similar complaint, and as safe, pleasant and efectual remedy for consumptions, and all diseases of the breast and lungs. w. PRICE.\n\n The celebrated Dr. Cullen has taught us that tour first attention should be employed iu watching the approach of the disease and preventing its proceeding to an incurable state; and in persons of a consumptive habit, especially those born of consumptive parents, the slightest symptoms of approaching con- sumption at the consumptive period of life ought carefully to be attended to-\"\n\n The Specific is obtained by extraction from herbs, roots, flowers, plants, Szc. when in per lection. In consequence of happy combi- nation of the most valuable herbs, SZc. it be- comes balsam of superior value. It heals inc injured parts, opens the pores and com poses the disturbed nerves, after the manner of an annodyne; consequently the obstruc- ton of the chest and the lungs which cOnsti- tute the disease, particularly need its use. It promotes expeetoration, which is constantly called for; and whilst it cleanses and heals it also gives strength to the tender lungs. In this manner it removes the hectic fever, improves digestion, gives strength to the nerves, repairs the appetite and improves the spirits. This specific may always be given in safety-it is mild, pleasant to the taste, and is found par dcularly useful in hypochondrical nervous & hysteiical diseases. Each bill of directions contains a detailed account of this disease in all its different stages, and will be accompani- ed with the signature of the proprietor in red ink.

Flowers die without air. They fade without light; and it is well known will yearn after it, and bend themselves toward the window,if put into dark corner. Do we suppose, that in our internal organiza- tion,-that in all that wonderful system of nerves and flores, by means of which we have sensation, and are enabled to think, do we suppose that in all this we are less delicately constructed than flowers, or can better dispense with what is to keep us bright and happy? An oak is strong, but do we fancy that we could plant it with im- punity in an unnatural soil or deny it air and light, or drench it with poisonous wa ters :! Above all, commend us, to corpu- lent lady! or a bird made to lie all day on sofa. While we have the principle of motion within us, we must use it., or take the consequences. While the ladies give the flowers nothing but what is fit for them, are there any who fancy that they can put into themselves loads of preposterous meet and drink, and yet retain the graces and hues, which impels poets and lovers to be- stow upon them their flowery appellations? Let them stuff lily first, and see how it looks. Let them swell out tube-rose, or plant or a sweet briar in a parole of kitchen stuff. \"Disgusting images !' they will cry. Disgusting indeed but how then can they consent to do, what they dare not in com mon nature and propriety think of? We will answer for them.-They do not think of it or if they do, it is with regret, with dislike, with resolutions of amendment and then they indulge themselves again in order to get rid of their sorrow. This is human nature and it is to be pardoned. All that we say is, it is not human nature as it should be and might be; nor is it love; nor is it beauty. Love renders us lovely. What beauty a woman has is degraded and rendered not beautiful, if she contradicts the sentiment of beauty. It is transferred to the next woman who appreciates it bet ter, and who possesses at heart the loveli- ness which the other has missed. It is for this reason we see so many faces that are delightful in spite of common features, and so many, called beautiful, that we come to think poorly of, and even to dislike. It is in vain that woman carries . smooth cheek, if the effect ofher intercourse be hlrsh and grating. We shall feel the mis- cry of that, twenty times to what we, reap from the other ; and what poor good it becomes We soon learn to care as little for it, as we care for a Japan tea-board. At length, we recoil from the smooth im- postor that gives us taste of sweetness on- ly to make our lives the bitterer. But a cheek, sprinkled even with the small pox, that has charming lip to it, or an eye that promises tenderness and joy, how we love, and are grateful to it, and take on it deli- cious pity ,and look to it for pity ourselves!

When it is said, that air spells the complexion. it { is not meant that breathing it does so, but exposure to it. We are coyinced that it is altogether a fallacy, and nothing but constant exposure to the ex tremes of heat and cold will produce any such effect. The not breathing the fresh air is confess sedly injurious and this might be done much oftener than is supposed. People might oftener throw up their windows; or admit the air partially, and with an effect sensible only to the general feelings.

A gipsy with an, eye fit for genius, it is not difficult to meet with {: but where shall we find a genius, or even tund-holder, with the check and health of gipsy.\n\n There is fact well known to physicians which settles at once the importance ot fresh air to beauty, as well as health. It is, that in. proportion as people stay al home, and do not set their lungs playing a: they ought, the blood becomes dark, ant lags in it's current; whereas the habit of in- mailing the air out of doors, reddens it like ruby, and makes it clear and brisk. Now the darker the blood the more melancho- ly the sensations, aud the worse the com plexion. ,t.. '\n\n It is common with persons who inherit a good stock of health from their ancestors, to argue that they take no particular pains to preserve it, and yet are always well. This may be true and it is also true, that there is painstaking to that effect, which is superfuous and morbid, and helps to do more harm than good. But it does not fol- low from either of these truths, that a neglect of the rational means of retaining health will ultimately be good for any bo- dy. Healthy people may live good while upon their stock. Children are in the habit of doing it.-But healthy chil- dren, especially those who are foolishly treated upon an assumption that health consists in being highly fed and having great beef-eating cheeks, very often turn",

Af- ter the fainting, for instance, the window is shut again, ,and the spirit of existence sent about it's business, like village apotheca- Try. We get up without air; we break fast, dine, and sup, without air we write, read, and perform every avocation possible without it: and then beauties lament their roses, and the manifest wonder that they become\" nervous\" Neither beauty nor manliness can do without the hsl lp of nature. The reason 1 why the richer classes are handsomer than the others, is not that they have nothing to do, or that 'gentle blood' is bit better, or gentler than other blood. Their having nothing to do is bad for them and their 'gentle blood\" if left to itself, would soon get ferocious with high living. The rea- son is, that they take more exercise, spend great deal more time in the country, and arc gifted by their education with supe- rior turn for grace and enjoyment. We doubt whether they have fewer cares than the middling classes, though their cares may be of different sort but they car ry them off better by dint of their horse- back and country air, and their opinions partake of the liberality of their move- ments. They do not turn domesticity into vice or mere habit, and then take the carking importance for virtue. Ladies on horseback are apt to be thought mascu- | hUrx HA is rNskx our opinion, that all women cannot afford to ride on horseback we are sorry that some are so rich as to possess more horses than they want, and others too poor to have any. But there are few women so poor as not to be able to take more air, and exer- else moro than they do and if they did this, they would get wiser, ,and criticise one another with good temper more becom- ing to their sex. A female jocky is nuis- ance, and no woman. The best thing we can hope of her is, that her father was an ostler. But Sophia Western on horseback is another matter. A rile before dinner about the Regents Park, or towards the western Harrow, is only dance that be- comes the loveliest. It sends bloom into their cheeks and brightness into their eyes, and being natural and healthy, serves to re- tain them there. The famous Diana de Poitiers who at an advanced age excited the astonishment of BraDtome, and preserv- ed the love of king many years younger than herself, used to ride out for two hours every morning {; after which she lay down and read. Her books perhaps taught her this wisdom and her exercise enabled her to enjoy them. There is notion that air spells the complexion. Itis possible that an expos ure to all weathers might do so though fl gipsy beauty is to be said to have bad complexion, it is one We are very much in- clincd to be in love with. A russeton ap- pie has its beauty as well as peach. At all events, a spoilt complexion of this sort is accompanied with none of the melancholy attending the bad complications that arise from late hours, and spleen and plodding, and iadolence, and indigestion.

In consequence of happy combi- nation of the most valuable herbs, SZc. it be- comes balsam of superior value.

            "article": "with them, the greatest of all is, in ninty- nine instances out of hundred, no better or grander than non-performance of the common duties of health. Many fine lady takes surfeit for tender distress and many a real sufferer, who is haunted by regret, or takes himself for the most i'll used or bilious old gentleman, might trace the loftiest of his woes to no better origin than series of ham-pies, or want 1 ot proper use of his boots and umbrella. Flowers die without air. They fade without light; and it is well known will yearn after it, and bend themselves toward the window,if put into dark corner. Do we suppose, that in our internal organiza- tion,-that in all that wonderful system of nerves and flores, by means of which we have sensation, and are enabled to think, do we suppose that in all this we are less delicately constructed than flowers, or can better dispense with what is to keep us bright and happy? An oak is strong, but do we fancy that we could plant it with im- punity in an unnatural soil or deny it air and light, or drench it with poisonous wa ters :! Above all, commend us, to corpu- lent lady! or a bird made to lie all day on sofa. While we have the principle of motion within us, we must use it., or take the consequences. While the ladies give the flowers nothing but what is fit for them, are there any who fancy that they can put into themselves loads of preposterous meet and drink, and yet retain the graces and hues, which impels poets and lovers to be- stow upon them their flowery appellations? Let them stuff lily first, and see how it looks. Let them swell out tube-rose, or plant or a sweet briar in a parole of kitchen stuff. \"Disgusting images !' they will cry. Disgusting indeed but how then can they consent to do, what they dare not in com mon nature and propriety think of? We will answer for them.-They do not think of it or if they do, it is with regret, with dislike, with resolutions of amendment and then they indulge themselves again in order to get rid of their sorrow. This is human nature and it is to be pardoned. All that we say is, it is not human nature as it should be and might be; nor is it love; nor is it beauty. Love renders us lovely. What beauty a woman has is degraded and rendered not beautiful, if she contradicts the sentiment of beauty. It is transferred to the next woman who appreciates it bet ter, and who possesses at heart the loveli- ness which the other has missed. It is for this reason we see so many faces that are delightful in spite of common features, and so many, called beautiful, that we come to think poorly of, and even to dislike. It is in vain that woman carries . smooth cheek, if the effect ofher intercourse be hlrsh and grating. We shall feel the mis- cry of that, twenty times to what we, reap from the other ; and what poor good it becomes We soon learn to care as little for it, as we care for a Japan tea-board. At length, we recoil from the smooth im- postor that gives us taste of sweetness on- ly to make our lives the bitterer. But a cheek, sprinkled even with the small pox, that has charming lip to it, or an eye that promises tenderness and joy, how we love, and are grateful to it, and take on it deli- cious pity ,and look to it for pity ourselves! Set us one of these soul beauties on horse- back and give her tmge of the fresh air in her cheeks, and let her shape be seen in its natural grace and activity, and your la zy, languid, eating, and drinking,corpulent, sleekfaced beauties become parcel of\n\n beef-eaters in the comparison; yeo-Women\n\n of the mouth.

Cheer fulness itself helps to make good blood: and air and exercise make cheerfulness. When it is said, that air spells the complexion. it { is not meant that breathing it does so, but exposure to it. We are coyinced that it is altogether a fallacy, and nothing but constant exposure to the ex tremes of heat and cold will produce any such effect. The not breathing the fresh air is confess sedly injurious and this might be done much oftener than is supposed. People might oftener throw up their windows; or admit the air partially, and with an effect sensible only to the general feelings. We ind, by repeated experiments, that we can write better and longer with the admission of air into our study. We have learnt al- so by the same experience, to prefer large study to small one and here the rich, it must be confessed, have another advan- tage over us. They pass their days in large airy rooms--in apartments that are field and champain, compared with the closets that we dignify with the name of parlors and drawing-rooms. A gipsy and they are-in this respect, and in many oth- ers,more on footing; and the gipsy beau- Nty and the park beauty enjoy themselves accordingly. Can we look at that extre- ordinary race of persons-we mean the gipsies-and not recognize the wonderful physical perfection to which they are brought, solely from the exemption of some of our most inveterate notions, and by dint of living constantly in the fresh air Read any of the accounts that are given of them, even by writers the most opposed to their way of life, and you will find these very writers refuting themselves and their pro- posed ameliorations by confessing that no human being can be better formed, or healthier, or happier, than the gipsies, so long as they are kept out of the way of towns and their sophistications. A suicide is not known among them. They are as merry as the larks with which they rise have the use of their limbs to degree un- known among us, except by our new friends the gymnasts; and arc as sharp in their fac ulties as the perfection of frames can render them. A glass of brandy puts them into state of unbearable transport. It is super fuous bliss wine added to wine and the old learn to do themselves mischief with it, and level their conditions with stockbrok- CTS and politicians Yet these are the peo- pie whom some wisacres are for turning in- to bigots and manufacturers. They had much better take them for what they are, and for what Providence seems to have in- tended them, memorandum to keep alive among us the belief in nature, and proof to what a physical state of perfection the human being can be brought, solely by in- haling her glorious breath, and being ex- empt from our laborious mistakes. If the intelligent and the gipsy life could ever be brought moro together, by any rational compromise we do not dispair of it, when we see that calculators begin to phloso- phize) men might attain the greatest per- lection of which they arc capable. Mean while, the gipsies have the advantage oft, if faces are any index of health and comfort. A gipsy with an, eye fit for genius, it is not difficult to meet with {: but where shall we find a genius, or even tund-holder, with the check and health of gipsy.\n\n There is fact well known to physicians which settles at once the importance ot fresh air to beauty, as well as health. It is, that in. proportion as people stay al home, and do not set their lungs playing a: they ought, the blood becomes dark, ant lags in it's current; whereas the habit of in- mailing the air out of doors, reddens it like ruby, and makes it clear and brisk. Now the darker the blood the more melancho- ly the sensations, aud the worse the com plexion. ,t.. '\n\n It is common with persons who inherit a good stock of health from their ancestors, to argue that they take no particular pains to preserve it, and yet are always well. This may be true and it is also true, that there is painstaking to that effect, which is superfuous and morbid, and helps to do more harm than good. But it does not fol- low from either of these truths, that a neglect of the rational means of retaining health will ultimately be good for any bo- dy. Healthy people may live good while upon their stock. Children are in the habit of doing it.-But healthy chil- dren, especially those who are foolishly treated upon an assumption that health consists in being highly fed and having great beef-eating cheeks, very often turn",

Af- ter the fainting, for instance, the window is shut again, ,and the spirit of existence sent about it's business, like village apotheca- Try. We get up without air; we break fast, dine, and sup, without air we write, read, and perform every avocation possible without it: and then beauties lament their roses, and the manifest wonder that they become\" nervous\" Neither beauty nor manliness can do without the hsl lp of nature. The reason 1 why the richer classes are handsomer than the others, is not that they have nothing to do, or that 'gentle blood' is bit better, or gentler than other blood. Their having nothing to do is bad for them and their 'gentle blood\" if left to itself, would soon get ferocious with high living. The rea- son is, that they take more exercise, spend great deal more time in the country, and arc gifted by their education with supe- rior turn for grace and enjoyment. We doubt whether they have fewer cares than the middling classes, though their cares may be of different sort but they car ry them off better by dint of their horse- back and country air, and their opinions partake of the liberality of their move- ments. They do not turn domesticity into vice or mere habit, and then take the carking importance for virtue. Ladies on horseback are apt to be thought mascu- | hUrx HA is rNskx our opinion, that all women cannot afford to ride on horseback we are sorry that some are so rich as to possess more horses than they want, and others too poor to have any. But there are few women so poor as not to be able to take more air, and exer- else moro than they do and if they did this, they would get wiser, ,and criticise one another with good temper more becom- ing to their sex. A female jocky is nuis- ance, and no woman. The best thing we can hope of her is, that her father was an ostler. But Sophia Western on horseback is another matter. A rile before dinner about the Regents Park, or towards the western Harrow, is only dance that be- comes the loveliest. It sends bloom into their cheeks and brightness into their eyes, and being natural and healthy, serves to re- tain them there. The famous Diana de Poitiers who at an advanced age excited the astonishment of BraDtome, and preserv- ed the love of king many years younger than herself, used to ride out for two hours every morning {; after which she lay down and read. Her books perhaps taught her this wisdom and her exercise enabled her to enjoy them. There is notion that air spells the complexion. Itis possible that an expos ure to all weathers might do so though fl gipsy beauty is to be said to have bad complexion, it is one We are very much in- clincd to be in love with. A russeton ap- pie has its beauty as well as peach. At all events, a spoilt complexion of this sort is accompanied with none of the melancholy attending the bad complications that arise from late hours, and spleen and plodding, and iadolence, and indigestion.
