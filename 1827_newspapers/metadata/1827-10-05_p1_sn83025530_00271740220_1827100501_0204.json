Mr. Justice Iiltedae\ncharged the jury to find them not guilty. on the\nground that in legal construction the words 9 two\nducks'' must be taken to mean 6 two Ere ducks :\"\nwhereas. it was proved that these ducks were deai:\nand the parties we're found not guilty accordingly.\nquery: is not duck duck ? And if not. wnat\nis It'll Would the thieves who stole the ducks have\nbeen not guilty Of stealing the ducks, surprising they\nhad only hay killed the ducks before they stole\nthem\n\n\nA notorious gang of robbers, on the Windsor\nroad. escaped at the Quarter sessions. because the\ndrawing up of the indictment had described gown\nand petlcoat as the property OF woman instead OF\nman this said woman happening to be married,\nthe learned chairman held that it legally belonged to\nthe husband, and on this plea the whole gang were\nacquitted, much to the annoyance pf worthy ma\ngistrate who declared that he had heard of wife\nwearing the breeches, but never before OF husband\nwearing the pettcoat. At the same sessions an in\ndiyldua. tried on an indictment for sheep stealing.\nseemed i'll fair way to escape, by his legal defender\nproving that the animal was not leeally sheep, in\nconsequence of not being come Of age and the mat\nter was put aside to be grayey argued at future\nperiod. Nothing could exceed the astonishment of\n\n\n\n\n\nvowed he would call pig, and try what the effect\nof that would be.\n\n\nWHO shall decide when doctors disagree ~\nJudge Best's charge in favor Of pugilism, will be\nfound under that head in another place. At the\nsame point of time Judge Garrow was making the\nfollowing charge against it at Bedford. He said If\nquarrel is treasured up, and time be taken to ar\nrange the meeting and one of the party fails, the\nthe offence amounts TO murder, and principal Sc\nconds, and BY ISLANDERS were all guilty. He called\non the Grand Jury to put stop to the practice OF\nprize fights, which he regretted to say, had been\npatlonized by men Of rank, who sported their soy-\nereigns on the life or death of fellow creature.\n\n\nJohn Maule, the prisoner tried at Salisbury, was\nindict I'd for having, the 18th of Jane last, Killed\none Thomas Strange. by upsetting cuach on which\nthe said I. Strange was passenger. Inc second\ncount described the coach as having been drawn tty\nfsco geldngs and tsco mares One objection to the\nIndictment, namely, that it did not state the acc-\ndent to have occurred on the Kings highway, or IN\npublic road and all the precedents showed that such\nan averment was necessary, was over-rulea ny the\nchief Justice who observed, that he had little doubt\n. the precedents would furnish instances OF nom\nsense of all sorts.''

            "article": "\n\n\nFROM A LONDON PAPER OF AUGUST 8. 1927.\n\n\nAt the present assizes for Worcester, certain\nparties were indicted for stealing flUo ducks; but\nas it came out in evidence that they Killed the two\nducks before they stole them. Mr. Justice Iiltedae\ncharged the jury to find them not guilty. on the\nground that in legal construction the words 9 two\nducks'' must be taken to mean 6 two Ere ducks :\"\nwhereas. it was proved that these ducks were deai:\nand the parties we're found not guilty accordingly.\nquery: is not duck duck ? And if not. wnat\nis It'll Would the thieves who stole the ducks have\nbeen not guilty Of stealing the ducks, surprising they\nhad only hay killed the ducks before they stole\nthem\n\n\nA notorious gang of robbers, on the Windsor\nroad. escaped at the Quarter sessions. because the\ndrawing up of the indictment had described gown\nand petlcoat as the property OF woman instead OF\nman this said woman happening to be married,\nthe learned chairman held that it legally belonged to\nthe husband, and on this plea the whole gang were\nacquitted, much to the annoyance pf worthy ma\ngistrate who declared that he had heard of wife\nwearing the breeches, but never before OF husband\nwearing the pettcoat. At the same sessions an in\ndiyldua. tried on an indictment for sheep stealing.\nseemed i'll fair way to escape, by his legal defender\nproving that the animal was not leeally sheep, in\nconsequence of not being come Of age and the mat\nter was put aside to be grayey argued at future\nperiod. Nothing could exceed the astonishment of\n\n\n\n\n\nvowed he would call pig, and try what the effect\nof that would be.\n\n\nWHO shall decide when doctors disagree ~\nJudge Best's charge in favor Of pugilism, will be\nfound under that head in another place. At the\nsame point of time Judge Garrow was making the\nfollowing charge against it at Bedford. He said If\nquarrel is treasured up, and time be taken to ar\nrange the meeting and one of the party fails, the\nthe offence amounts TO murder, and principal Sc\nconds, and BY ISLANDERS were all guilty. He called\non the Grand Jury to put stop to the practice OF\nprize fights, which he regretted to say, had been\npatlonized by men Of rank, who sported their soy-\nereigns on the life or death of fellow creature.\n\n\nJohn Maule, the prisoner tried at Salisbury, was\nindict I'd for having, the 18th of Jane last, Killed\none Thomas Strange. by upsetting cuach on which\nthe said I. Strange was passenger. Inc second\ncount described the coach as having been drawn tty\nfsco geldngs and tsco mares One objection to the\nIndictment, namely, that it did not state the acc-\ndent to have occurred on the Kings highway, or IN\npublic road and all the precedents showed that such\nan averment was necessary, was over-rulea ny the\nchief Justice who observed, that he had little doubt\n. the precedents would furnish instances OF nom\nsense of all sorts.'' But it was then oblected-lt\nwas alleged that the coach was drawn by two mares\nand two geldings, which allegation had not been\nsupported by proof This was humping objection\ntwo mares and two gednss stated in the ndlct-\nnlent, and no one to prove the avsrment The",

I'M\nderstood only Turkish and Arabic, so that what\nsaid in Italian had to be translated into Arabic, and\nthe Arabic into Turkish; thus, to understand each\nother, we had need of three languages and two inter\nprefers.\n\n\nltmay readily be supposed that the conversation\ncould not go on uently, as we depended on the good\nwill and talents OF our interpreters in fact, qut pro\n. que resulting from the bad TRANSACTIONS of our qnes\n:. lions and answers, were truly comic, and created\nmuch gacty, that loud and repeated bursts of laugh\nter established good understanding between\nus.
