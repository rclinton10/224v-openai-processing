States-gOv- erned without aking.'\n\n The missionaries have wrought wonders among these people but their work is yet far from being complete and fear,about this time, their labors wiilbe interrupted by civilwar. The queen, inwhOm the regency of the.island is vested, during the minority of young POmare, the heir apparent to the throne, has recently married, contrary to the wishes of many of her subjects, partic- ulafly those who inhabit the South side of the fsiand-and they are the stronger par ty, and insist upon the queens abdication, or, dissolution of the marriage. But as her majesty does not think proper to com- ply with either of those demands, in which refusal she will be supported by this district and mostof the enlightened men, a recourse to arms will be the probable result. A general council of all the chiefs and mis- sionaries is to be held at the great council house, uear this, in a few days,sto discuss the merits of the royal matrimony. The missionaries have packed up their movea- ble effects, and some have embarked their most valuable things, ready to decamp up- on the first commencement of hostilities.\n\n Our arrival at Tahiti at this crisis, is considered by the missionaries and the queens party as very epportune, and they have requested us to visit and attend, the contemplated Council. The queen paid us visit, some days past, and was saluted with thirteen guns, which greatly pleased her Tahitian majesty and suit, composed of the civil and military chiefs, and nu- merous retinue of the various orders of so- ciety. Our stay here is rather uncertain, ,as Capt. Jones* wishes to see the result of the contemplated Council, ,and to visit some other ports in this and the neighboring islands\n\n ' *ftswas Capt. ,PercivA who commanded the.

It is probable that the population of at least, Pompeii, had time to make their escape. A pedlar's pack would contain all the valuables left in Pompeii; and the people had time thus to clear their premis- es, must have been singularly fond of haz- ard, if they staid lingering within the reach of the eruption. But some melancholy evidences remain that allwere not so suc- cessful.\n\n In one of the last excavations, made by the French, four female skeletons, were found lying together, with their ornaments, bracelets and rings, and with their little hoard of coins in gold and silver. They probably had been suffocated by the sul- phorous vapor. In wine cellar, known by its jars arranged around the wall, male skeleton, supposed to be that of a master by his sealing-ring, was found as if he had perished in the attempt to force the door. In another male skeleton was found with was breaking open. In pris on the skel- tons of men chained to the wall were found. If it were nor like afectation to regret ag- ony that had passed away so long, it might be conceived as paliation of moment, that the vapour of the eruption extinguish- ed life at once, and that these unfortunates perished, not because they were left be- hind ln, the general flight, but were left be- hind because they had perished. ..s::, IT\n\n A large portion of Pompeii is now un- covered. This was an easy operation, for it's covering was ashes, themselves cov-, cred by vegetable, soil, and that again cov- cred by verdue and vineyards.-Hercula- neum reserves its development for another generation its cover is lavo, solid as rock and that again covered with two villages and royal palace and the whole under the protection of a still surer guard, Nea- politan stupidity, poverty and incidence. The Panorama gives striking coup-d'oei of one of the two great excavations of Pom- pei.

SLooP OF WAR PEACOCK.\n\n ] PassGeta, Otahiti, August IS, 1926.\n\n 1 You were informed of our contemplated cruise among the South Sea Islands, for the protection of our extensive whale fishery in this remote quarter of the globe. Or June 27th, we sailed from Guayaquil, anG on July 4th anchored in Essex Bay, Charle. Island, one of the Galapagos. Novelty ,& a desire to get stock oftortoises, prompt ed us to anchor at this Island, both of which objects being accomplished in four days. (having taken upwards of 300 terrapins on board) on the Sth, we put to sea, and on the 22d, anchored in Massachusetts Bay, Madison Island, having performed the pas- sage in less than 15 days, during which time the ship actually ran over 32OO miles, ave- raging more than 200 miles per day. At Massachusetts Bay we remained days, during which time the ship was visited by almost the whole population of that part of the Island. Their surprize and admiration appeared unsuitable. There were numerous applications among the young men to ac- company us to America, two of whom we now have on board, and may probably gratify you with sight of them.\n\n Massachusetts Bay, you will remember, is the port Com. Porter occupied with the Essex, and her prizes, during the late war. The ramparts ofFort Madison are still vis- ible, and the wall that encompassed Porter's camp remains, though in dilapidated state. On the morning of August 7th, the high island, Otaheite, was visible from the deck, and the next day, we anchored in Matavia Bay. Matavia is now one ofthe regular mis- sionary stations of Tahiti, of which there are nine at present on this island. Soon af- ter anchoring the Rev. MT. Wilson, who has charge of the Matavia district, accomp- anied by two of the principal chiefs, came on board to welcome our arrival, which they hailed as new era, the Peacock being the only American man-of-war ever here. The two successive days, we were visit ed by the several dignitaries of the district among whom was the Chief Justice, whose name is Parvor.-He is man remarkable for his size and stature, weighing not less than three hundred weight.--As far as we can judge, his intellect is not out of propor- ton. He is well educated--is very fond of talking, or rather argument, at which he IS very acute, and quite an orator. His in- formation is general he has a perfect\n\n Nnowledge of the principles of the English\n\n and American Governments, frequently\n\n discusses theirrespective merits, and great \" prefers that of the U. States to all others. Almost the first question Judge Parvor asked me, was, \"Who is President of the\n\n u. States now \" And when | informed hinrMr. Adams was, he called for pen ,and wrote the Presidents name on memoran- dunn which he carries with him, remark",

In the year of the Christian era 63, an earthquake showed the city on what tenure her lease was held. Whole streets were thrown down, and the eviden- ces of nasty repair are still to be de- tected.\n\n From this period, occasional warnings were given in slight shocks until in the year 79, Vesuvius poured out all his old accumulation of terrors at once, and on the clearing away of the cloud of fire and ash- es which covered Campania for four days, Pompeii, with all it's multitude, was gone. The Romans seem to have been as fond of Villas as fevery soul of them had made fof- tunes in Cheapside, and the whole south ern coast was covered with summer pala- ces of those lords of the world. Versuvi~ us is now formidable foundation for s house whose inhabitants may not wish 10 be sucked into furnace ten thousand fa'h- oms deep, or roasted sub acre opsrto, but it was then asleep, and had never flung up spark or stone from time immemorial. To those who look upon it now n its terrors, grim, blasted, and lifting up it's sooty fore- head among the piles of perpetual smoak that are to be enlightened only by its bursts of fire, the very throne of Pluto and Vul- can together, no force of fancy may pic- ture what it was when the Roman built his palaces and pavilion on its side. A pyra- mid of three thousand feet high, painted O. yer with garden, forest, vineyard and or- ned with colonades, and turrets, and gol- den roofs, and marble porticos, with the eternal azure of the Companion sky for it's canopy, and the Mediterranean at its feet, glittering in the colours of sunshine noon and evening, like au infinite Turkey car- pet let down from the steps of throne all this was turned into cinders, lava, and hot water, on If we can trust to chronolo- cyl the first day of November, Anno Dom- ini 70, in the first year of the Emperor Titus The whole story is told in the younger Pliney's letters: or, if the illus trious of one who thought himself born for describer, bio Cassius, be sought, it will be found that this eruption was worthy the work it had to do, and was a handsome recompense for the long slumber of the volcano. The continent, throughout its whole southern range, probably felt this vigorous awakening. Rome was covered with the ashes, of which Northern Africa, Egypt and Asia Minor had their share. The sun was turned into blood and dark ness, and the people thought that the de- struction of the world was come.\n\n At the close of the eruption, Vesuyius stood forth the naked giant that he is at this hour-the palaces and the gardens are all dust and air-the sky was stained with that cloud which sits like crown of wrath upon his brow-the plain at his foot, where Herculaneum and Pompeii spread circus es and temples, like children's toys, was covered over with sand charcoal and smoke -and the whole was left for mighty mor- al against the danger of trusting to the sleep of volcano.\n\n All was then at an end with the cities below; tho population were burnt, and had no more need of houses the Roman nobles had no passions for combustion, and kept aloof; the winds and rains, robbers and the mOlaria, were the sole tenants of the land; and in this way rolled fifteen hundred years over the bones of the vint- ners, sailors, and snug citizens of the Ve- suvian cities. But their time was to come; and their beds were to be perforated by French and Neapolitan pick-axes, and to be visited by English feet, and sketched, and written about, and Autographed, till all the world wished they never had been",

The queen, inwhOm the regency of the.island is vested, during the minority of young POmare, the heir apparent to the throne, has recently married, contrary to the wishes of many of her subjects, partic- ulafly those who inhabit the South side of the fsiand-and they are the stronger par ty, and insist upon the queens abdication, or, dissolution of the marriage. But as her majesty does not think proper to com- ply with either of those demands, in which refusal she will be supported by this district and mostof the enlightened men, a recourse to arms will be the probable result. A general council of all the chiefs and mis- sionaries is to be held at the great council house, uear this, in a few days,sto discuss the merits of the royal matrimony. The missionaries have packed up their movea- ble effects, and some have embarked their most valuable things, ready to decamp up- on the first commencement of hostilities.\n\n Our arrival at Tahiti at this crisis, is considered by the missionaries and the queens party as very epportune, and they have requested us to visit and attend, the contemplated Council. The queen paid us visit, some days past, and was saluted with thirteen guns, which greatly pleased her Tahitian majesty and suit, composed of the civil and military chiefs, and nu- merous retinue of the various orders of so- ciety. Our stay here is rather uncertain, ,as Capt. Jones* wishes to see the result of the contemplated Council, ,and to visit some other ports in this and the neighboring islands\n\n ' *ftswas Capt. ,PercivA who commanded the.

It is probable that the population of at least, Pompeii, had time to make their escape. A pedlar's pack would contain all the valuables left in Pompeii; and the people had time thus to clear their premis- es, must have been singularly fond of haz- ard, if they staid lingering within the reach of the eruption. But some melancholy evidences remain that allwere not so suc- cessful.\n\n In one of the last excavations, made by the French, four female skeletons, were found lying together, with their ornaments, bracelets and rings, and with their little hoard of coins in gold and silver. They probably had been suffocated by the sul- phorous vapor. In wine cellar, known by its jars arranged around the wall, male skeleton, supposed to be that of a master by his sealing-ring, was found as if he had perished in the attempt to force the door. In another male skeleton was found with was breaking open. In pris on the skel- tons of men chained to the wall were found. If it were nor like afectation to regret ag- ony that had passed away so long, it might be conceived as paliation of moment, that the vapour of the eruption extinguish- ed life at once, and that these unfortunates perished, not because they were left be- hind ln, the general flight, but were left be- hind because they had perished. ..s::, IT\n\n A large portion of Pompeii is now un- covered. This was an easy operation, for it's covering was ashes, themselves cov-, cred by vegetable, soil, and that again cov- cred by verdue and vineyards.-Hercula- neum reserves its development for another generation its cover is lavo, solid as rock and that again covered with two villages and royal palace and the whole under the protection of a still surer guard, Nea- politan stupidity, poverty and incidence.

SLooP OF WAR PEACOCK.\n\n ] PassGeta, Otahiti, August IS, 1926.\n\n 1 You were informed of our contemplated cruise among the South Sea Islands, for the protection of our extensive whale fishery in this remote quarter of the globe. Or June 27th, we sailed from Guayaquil, anG on July 4th anchored in Essex Bay, Charle. Island, one of the Galapagos. Novelty ,& a desire to get stock oftortoises, prompt ed us to anchor at this Island, both of which objects being accomplished in four days. (having taken upwards of 300 terrapins on board) on the Sth, we put to sea, and on the 22d, anchored in Massachusetts Bay, Madison Island, having performed the pas- sage in less than 15 days, during which time the ship actually ran over 32OO miles, ave- raging more than 200 miles per day. At Massachusetts Bay we remained days, during which time the ship was visited by almost the whole population of that part of the Island. Their surprize and admiration appeared unsuitable. There were numerous applications among the young men to ac- company us to America, two of whom we now have on board, and may probably gratify you with sight of them.\n\n Massachusetts Bay, you will remember, is the port Com. Porter occupied with the Essex, and her prizes, during the late war. The ramparts ofFort Madison are still vis- ible, and the wall that encompassed Porter's camp remains, though in dilapidated state. On the morning of August 7th, the high island, Otaheite, was visible from the deck, and the next day, we anchored in Matavia Bay. Matavia is now one ofthe regular mis- sionary stations of Tahiti, of which there are nine at present on this island. Soon af- ter anchoring the Rev. MT. Wilson, who has charge of the Matavia district, accomp- anied by two of the principal chiefs, came on board to welcome our arrival, which they hailed as new era, the Peacock being the only American man-of-war ever here. The two successive days, we were visit ed by the several dignitaries of the district among whom was the Chief Justice, whose name is Parvor.-He is man remarkable for his size and stature, weighing not less than three hundred weight.--As far as we can judge, his intellect is not out of propor- ton. He is well educated--is very fond of talking, or rather argument, at which he IS very acute, and quite an orator. His in- formation is general he has a perfect\n\n Nnowledge of the principles of the English\n\n and American Governments, frequently\n\n discusses theirrespective merits, and great \" prefers that of the U. States to all others. Almost the first question Judge Parvor asked me, was, \"Who is President of the\n\n u. States now \" And when | informed hinrMr. Adams was, he called for pen ,and wrote the Presidents name on memoran- dunn which he carries with him, remark",

She was reduced so low as to be unable to get from her bed to the fire without aid. All hopes of her recovery had long been given up. In this situation, was prevailed upon, as a last possible resort, yet without any hopes of success, to make use of\" Anderson's Cough Drops\" She com menced the use of them in February last and after using two bottles, to the astonishment of all, in the month of May following the health of my wife was entirely restored, and since which her health and strength were perhaps never better. Feeling deep interest that the public in genera! may resort to the same remedy, when their friends and relatives are apparently, or evidently on the brink of the grave, to rescue them from from the same. You are at liberty to publish the above.\n\n ana respectfully, S1c.\n\n JAMES H. STYLES. Rhinebeck, Dutchess co. (N. Y. J Nov. 8. 1926. This is to certify that the subscriber was brought very low by splitting blood, attended with cough and catarrh. and that nothing afforded me real relief until com menced ta- NWS AHuclso\" SouSl OlVPS' tHc uSe Ol which were the means in the hand of God of restoring me again to a comfortable state of health.\n\n And do further certify that the wife of MT. Nathan Huntington, living in the same place was afflicted with very bad cough for num- Der of years, and that in 1923 she was redu ced SO low that it was thought she must soon be in her grave, as she was scarcely able to walk from her bed to the fire, when she com menced taking Andersen's Cough Drops, the use of which, in a short time so far restored her, that she was soon able to do good days work. can cheerfully recommend this med icine to the public.\n\n PHILO HUDSON, Pastor\n\n of the Church in Ashford, (Conn.( Ashford, Sept. 25, 1924.\n\n 0F= For sale by w. & s.

            "article": " peii :-that it was a listlp Greek town of toierable commerce m us early day that the sea that once washed its walls, subse- uuently left in the midst of one of those delicious plains made by nature for the dissolution of all industry in the Italian dweIler, and for the common place of po- etry in all the northern abusers of the pen; that it was ravaged by every. barbarian, who in turn was called cOnqueror on the Italian soil, and was excessively the pil- lage of the Carthag4nian and of Roman, until at last the Augustan age saw it little quieted into the centre of a colony, and man, finding nothing more to rob, attempt ed to rob no more.\n\n When man had ceased his molestation, nature commenced hers and this unfor- tunate little city was, by curious fate, to be extinguished and preserved, to perish from the face of the Roman Empire, and to live when Rome was nest of monks and Mummers, and her empire torn into fragments for Turk, Russian, Austrian, and Prussian, and the whole host of bar barian names that were once as the dust of her feet. In the year of the Christian era 63, an earthquake showed the city on what tenure her lease was held. Whole streets were thrown down, and the eviden- ces of nasty repair are still to be de- tected.\n\n From this period, occasional warnings were given in slight shocks until in the year 79, Vesuvius poured out all his old accumulation of terrors at once, and on the clearing away of the cloud of fire and ash- es which covered Campania for four days, Pompeii, with all it's multitude, was gone. The Romans seem to have been as fond of Villas as fevery soul of them had made fof- tunes in Cheapside, and the whole south ern coast was covered with summer pala- ces of those lords of the world. Versuvi~ us is now formidable foundation for s house whose inhabitants may not wish 10 be sucked into furnace ten thousand fa'h- oms deep, or roasted sub acre opsrto, but it was then asleep, and had never flung up spark or stone from time immemorial. To those who look upon it now n its terrors, grim, blasted, and lifting up it's sooty fore- head among the piles of perpetual smoak that are to be enlightened only by its bursts of fire, the very throne of Pluto and Vul- can together, no force of fancy may pic- ture what it was when the Roman built his palaces and pavilion on its side. A pyra- mid of three thousand feet high, painted O. yer with garden, forest, vineyard and or- ned with colonades, and turrets, and gol- den roofs, and marble porticos, with the eternal azure of the Companion sky for it's canopy, and the Mediterranean at its feet, glittering in the colours of sunshine noon and evening, like au infinite Turkey car- pet let down from the steps of throne all this was turned into cinders, lava, and hot water, on If we can trust to chronolo- cyl the first day of November, Anno Dom- ini 70, in the first year of the Emperor Titus The whole story is told in the younger Pliney's letters: or, if the illus trious of one who thought himself born for describer, bio Cassius, be sought, it will be found that this eruption was worthy the work it had to do, and was a handsome recompense for the long slumber of the volcano. The continent, throughout its whole southern range, probably felt this vigorous awakening. Rome was covered with the ashes, of which Northern Africa, Egypt and Asia Minor had their share. The sun was turned into blood and dark ness, and the people thought that the de- struction of the world was come.\n\n At the close of the eruption, Vesuyius stood forth the naked giant that he is at this hour-the palaces and the gardens are all dust and air-the sky was stained with that cloud which sits like crown of wrath upon his brow-the plain at his foot, where Herculaneum and Pompeii spread circus es and temples, like children's toys, was covered over with sand charcoal and smoke -and the whole was left for mighty mor- al against the danger of trusting to the sleep of volcano.\n\n All was then at an end with the cities below; tho population were burnt, and had no more need of houses the Roman nobles had no passions for combustion, and kept aloof; the winds and rains, robbers and the mOlaria, were the sole tenants of the land; and in this way rolled fifteen hundred years over the bones of the vint- ners, sailors, and snug citizens of the Ve- suvian cities. But their time was to come; and their beds were to be perforated by French and Neapolitan pick-axes, and to be visited by English feet, and sketched, and written about, and Autographed, till all the world wished they never had been",
