Niles is republ- can--he is worthy of the confidence and SUD- port of republicans--he will be supported by republicans, not only in his own county, but throughout the state, and we trust also that hC viV hn nf fcn1 c1cf cfpnf fpAk ralists.\n\n The \"Hartford Mercury\" is the only Republican paper in the State which sup ports the Caucus Ticket entire. Ifthis be not an indication that the people are dis satisfied with Caucus dctation, and that they are determined to take the business of appointing their rulers into their own hands, we know not what could be considered fair expression of public feeling. The friends of the Caucus Ticket complain that the course now pursuing by republicans, is ungenerous, inasmuch as they have here toEore supported caucus tickets; and to reject it now is to cast contempt upon the members of the caucus, as also upon the candidates named by them ;--they assert that the discipline of the party requires that the caucus ticket should be supported, even if the men brought forward by it are not the first choice of the freemen. The course pursued by republicans is not un- generous, because they never delegated their representatives to appoint officers over ,hen,-they have heretofore submitted to an evil, rather than create contention; but when the evil had grown into an abuse, they could not, with justice to themselves. submit to it any longer. We will speak of the candidate for Congress from this conn- ty, in exempli6cation of the subject. MT: Merwin is the decided choice ofthe old re- publicans of Litch6eld county; and had he been nominated for re-election, the nominating caucus would have consulted or acceded to, the wishes of their constitu- ents; and no ground of complaint would have been preferred against them, although the principle, bad in itself, would not have",

These several acts have heretofore been transmitted to you, at periods which their provisions were in opperation but copies of them are again enclosed for your information and gov- ernment.\n\n As British vessels from some of the colo nial ports specified in the first section of the act of the 1st of March, l 823, may now be within the United States, and conse- quently must have arrived anterior to the date ofthe Proclamation, the President di- rects that all such British vessels be al- lowed to depart from our ports with their cargoes. As others may arrive between the dae of the procla@ation and the time of it's reaching you, he also directs | that as these the forfeitures and penalties of the aforesaid acts of April the 18th 18- IS, and May the 18th 1920, be not enfor- ccd ; but that they be permitted to depart. And if after you shall hase received the ] proclamation, British vessels should arrive within the ports of the United States from some one or more of the British colonial ports in ignorance of the prohibition which the laws impose to their entry, the Presi- dent further directs, that in the case of all British vessels so arriving, prior to the 1st. day of July next, you cause notice to be given to them, as soon as possible, of the ] prohibition, On,accompanjed by orders for their departure W it'in yer y-fnur hours, without unlading upon ehe failure to comply with which orders, you will proceed to enforce against them the provision of the acts last recited.\n\n In case of all British vessels arriving within our ports, from any of the aforesaid British colonial ports, after the first of Ju- ly, you will, forthwith enforce against them the provisions of those actss\n\n I have the honor to remain your obed't- servt.

The same argument will apply in relation to every county in the state where changes have been proposed. The assertion that the discipline of the party requires that the caucus should be support ed, sounds to us, who are somewhat tena- cious about the rights of freemen, not little singular. We have heard of discipl- ming regular troops, who have no rights of their own-have no voice in selecting their officers, and who are at best but mere tools of their commanders-but we never heard, without feelings of the strongest indigna- tion, of disciplining political parties !- What, discipline freemen Who are to be the disciplinarians Who created them dis ciplinarians? If created by the freemen, have not the freemen voluntarily become slaves ? Ifthey created themselves, ought not the freemen to arouse, and cast them from their assumed eminence? We know there are few \"master spirits,\" in this state who talk loud about discipline, and who claim the right of acting as discipline rians but we also know that the indepen- dent electors of Connecticut are tired of their dictation, and feel disposed hereafter to be their own rulers. This is as it should be. We talk of the purity of our republi- can government in vain, so long as our elections are governed by few aspiring ofice-seckers-so long as the freedom of our elections is disputed by caucus dicta- ton.\n\n From the Circular to the Collectors, issued from the Treasury department, and published in this paper, it will be seen that the Presi- dent has taken that step in relation to the British Colonial Trade which the virulence of the opposition, in refusing to act upon the subject in the Senate, has forced him to take. The leaders of the opposition hoped that the measures in relation to this trade, which they foresaw the President wonld be obliged to pursue, would render him unpopular among the people; but the President, having the majesty of the laws on his side, has nothing to fear from opposition among an enlightened community.",

Sir: send herewith, a copy of the Presidents proclamation, dated this day, by the effect of which you will perceive that the trade between the United States and ce4tan colonial ports of Great Britain, as opened hy the act of Congress of the first of March 1923, entitled \"An act to regulate the commercial intercourse be- tween the Um.ed States and certain Brit ish colonial ports, pril the eighteenth, 18- lS,entitled ''An act concerning navigation\" and those of the act of May the fifteenth, 1920, entitled 'An act supplementary to an act entitled an act concerning naviga- tion,\" are in force. These several acts have heretofore been transmitted to you, at periods which their provisions were in opperation but copies of them are again enclosed for your information and gov- ernment.\n\n As British vessels from some of the colo nial ports specified in the first section of the act of the 1st of March, l 823, may now be within the United States, and conse- quently must have arrived anterior to the date ofthe Proclamation, the President di- rects that all such British vessels be al- lowed to depart from our ports with their cargoes. As others may arrive between the dae of the procla@ation and the time of it's reaching you, he also directs | that as these the forfeitures and penalties of the aforesaid acts of April the 18th 18- IS, and May the 18th 1920, be not enfor- ccd ; but that they be permitted to depart. And if after you shall hase received the ] proclamation, British vessels should arrive within the ports of the United States from some one or more of the British colonial ports in ignorance of the prohibition which the laws impose to their entry, the Presi- dent further directs, that in the case of all British vessels so arriving, prior to the 1st. day of July next, you cause notice to be given to them, as soon as possible, of the ] prohibition, On,accompanjed by orders for their departure W it'in yer y-fnur hours, without unlading upon ehe failure to comply with which orders, you will proceed to enforce against them the provision of the acts last recited.\n\n In case of all British vessels arriving within our ports, from any of the aforesaid British colonial ports, after the first of Ju- ly, you will, forthwith enforce against them the provisions of those actss\n\n I have the honor to remain your obed't- servt.

            "article": "been approved; but when these few rep- reSentatives saw fit to trifle with the wish es of their constituents, and select a man for the station, who is not the choice of the republican electors, then the evil, which before could be borne, becomes intolera- ole, and the freemen cannot and ought not to submit to it: fin so doing they cast contempt upon the nominating caucus, very well ;4the representatives acted upon their own responsibility, and if the frecmen are not disposed to support them in their act, they have nO cause of complaint, for they acted voluntarily, and without author- ity, and if they acted wrong, they alone must suffer, and not the great body of the freemen. The same argument will apply in relation to every county in the state where changes have been proposed. The assertion that the discipline of the party requires that the caucus should be support ed, sounds to us, who are somewhat tena- cious about the rights of freemen, not little singular. We have heard of discipl- ming regular troops, who have no rights of their own-have no voice in selecting their officers, and who are at best but mere tools of their commanders-but we never heard, without feelings of the strongest indigna- tion, of disciplining political parties !- What, discipline freemen Who are to be the disciplinarians Who created them dis ciplinarians? If created by the freemen, have not the freemen voluntarily become slaves ? Ifthey created themselves, ought not the freemen to arouse, and cast them from their assumed eminence? We know there are few \"master spirits,\" in this state who talk loud about discipline, and who claim the right of acting as discipline rians but we also know that the indepen- dent electors of Connecticut are tired of their dictation, and feel disposed hereafter to be their own rulers. This is as it should be. We talk of the purity of our republi- can government in vain, so long as our elections are governed by few aspiring ofice-seckers-so long as the freedom of our elections is disputed by caucus dicta- ton.\n\n From the Circular to the Collectors, issued from the Treasury department, and published in this paper, it will be seen that the Presi- dent has taken that step in relation to the British Colonial Trade which the virulence of the opposition, in refusing to act upon the subject in the Senate, has forced him to take. The leaders of the opposition hoped that the measures in relation to this trade, which they foresaw the President wonld be obliged to pursue, would render him unpopular among the people; but the President, having the majesty of the laws on his side, has nothing to fear from opposition among an enlightened community.",
