In\nl794.wlo remarked that so many cotton mills would\nbe erected and much yarn spun, that it Woud be\nimpossible procure hands to weave it.. Mr. Cart.\nwright replied, that Mr..

Cartwright, took out patent for\nhis invention in 1887. The progress of power loom\nweaving was not at first rapid might have been\nexpected. That arose partly from the lmperfectons\nthat originally attached to the machine, but chiefly\nto the circumstance of its being necessary to dress\nthe webs from time to time after they put into\nthe looms. which made 1t impossible for one person\nto do more than attend to one loom. But beautiful\nmachine, invented by Mr..

According to Mr..

Cartwright, took out patent for\nhis invention in 1887. The progress of power loom\nweaving was not at first rapid might have been\nexpected. That arose partly from the lmperfectons\nthat originally attached to the machine, but chiefly\nto the circumstance of its being necessary to dress\nthe webs from time to time after they put into\nthe looms. which made 1t impossible for one person\nto do more than attend to one loom.

Whiteley, being an original Jacksohian re-\neotnends TO his g friends to give an undivided sup\nport TO the Jackson Ticket\" Now, whether Mr.\n| Whiteley considers the candidate nominated at Do\nyer on the 22nd, \"without any understanding with\nhim on the subject\" as truly Jackson man, is not\nstated in his card. Thathe could recommend to\nhis friends an undivided support OF man who has\nalled Jack -on 'da1,n'd old cut throat'-atter hav-\n| ing himself been thrown over board, according to\nthe original intention as soon all the arrange.\nspents suere completed, is scarcely credible. The\nJa,,Son ticket, therefore, as we apprehend, means\nin the estimation of MIR. Whiteley. the ticket tol\nSenator and House of Representatives OF the State\nnominated at Chrisliana. Such ticket, we have\nno doubt will be well supported by the party gener\nally: but it Is notorious that no recommendation o\nMr. Nhiteley, even if he could be prevailed upoI\n\n\nny ''oher reasons\" to give it in favour OF TIT\n\n\ndann'd old cut throat candidate, could possibl,\n\n\nproduce an i\" undivided support\" on the part OF hi\n! friends.\n\n\nMr.. Whiteley not only writes like aninjured man\n\n\nbut is felt the part Of his friends that he ha\n\n\nbeen badly treated. His claims to support o.\n\n\nNLme and Ridgcly were great. But they all mus\n\n\nbe forgotten, as soon as it was thought that tn\n\n\nrigiaM Jucksonia,as Were so bound that the Mana\n\n\nGERS could carry into effect their first intentions\n\n\nWe shall see.",
