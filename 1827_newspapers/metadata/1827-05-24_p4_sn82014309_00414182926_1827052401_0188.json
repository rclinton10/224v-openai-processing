Editors, since last addressed you, volley of Fast day Sermons has been discharged against the common enemy, and not without some effect. Some of the churches in this city, were half awaked, and, trust, that such another volley would bring them to stand upon their feet, and shake themselves from the reproach which has too long rested upon them. Let eve ry professing Christian say for himself, \"I have done with ardent spirits\" and the work will be half done. Let it no more be said, that such and such minister was seen to call at the bar of tavern, and tip off his glass with as good an air as the worst of us. Let it no more be said, that such and such professor may be good man, for aught we know, but he carries a red nose of his own, and we guess that, with all his religion, he would not stick at glass of brandy o, my brethren, let there be no more occasion for this reproach. Before conclude, I would say, that in my opinion there are some grocers in this city who are prepared to turn their liquor casks out of doors, and to give up the deal- ing in ardent spirits, altogether. And now, I call upon the friends of religion, the friends of their country, to look after them, and if there are any such to be found to patronize them. 5. ID.",

The present Report states that other portions have been translated into the Mohawk tongue by some intelligent AbO- recently forwarded to the Society ny the Rev. Wm. Case, Methodist minister in Lower Canada, and is now in press.\n\n 4 valuable set of 8 vO. stereotype piates' ] with contents of chapters prefxed, has recent l ly been purchased of the Baltimore Bible SO- cietv, to be paid for in Bibles and Testa- ] ments.\n\n | Bibles issued from the DepOsitory.-During the year, there has been issued from the De- posltory S5, ,G76 Bibles and 8, ,745 Testaments. Total 71,G2l winch added, to 40, ,0l4 issu- ed in the ten proceeding years, make grand total of 51I.667. Of the issue of the last year, 53, 337 have in various ways been dispO- sed of to auxiliary and other Societies and individuals. A still greater number might have been sold, had the rules of the Society permitted sales to those who are not mem bers. The number of Bibles and Testaments gratuitously appropriated during the years, 13.286.\n\n Comparing these issues with those of the proceeding year, it will be seen that they are greater by 4.487; while the number printed. Is less by 4,266. It IS also observable that the number sold is greater, while the number gratuitously appropriated is less. This last fact is attributed, in the report, to two causes. I. That the Board have during the greater part oflast year, been wholly without trav- cling agents ;-cOnsequently few new Auxll- aries have been formed, to which donations of Bibles are usually made on. recognizing them as connected with the Society. 2. The Managers have hesltated whether more sparing policy in regard to such grants to Auxiliaries, ought rot to be tried. They however express their readiness, at all times when able, to make gratuitous grants where they are truly needed, and where there is known zeal in the Auxiliary to put them in circulation.\n\n Great complaints are again made of the want ofBibles, in different sections of our county. In one county, in the State of Del aware, 500 families are supposed to be destl- tute in North Carolina, 10000; in South Carolina, perha 3s an equal number; in GeOr- gia, and Teouessee, the same. In short, the whole Southern and Western parts of the Union are in like deplorable situation. The Society has had no travelling Agents during the past year.\n\n The Rev. Jonas King, late American Mis- si0nary to Palestine, is now in Paris. The Board have requested him to act as delegate of the American Bible Society to that of Pa ris on its ensuing anniversary; and also, if practicable, as Delegate to the British and Foreign Bible Society. ...\n\n The Report concludes as follows; {\" The events of every revolving year indicate that the systems of Pagan corruption and cruelty are ere long to be broken up, and the light and principles of the Gospel to prevade eve ry kindred. and tongue, and people. But be- fore such consummatiOn is realized, much, very much, remains to he done. Not more than forty or fifty million copies of revealed truth, are yet in circulation among the eight hundred millions of the great human family.\n\n \"While then the ultimate uniyersality of the SaviOr's cause is certain as Divine vera city can make it,-whie its onward march is smore and more rapid, (never so much SO perhaps since the ascension of it's Founder as during the past year,) yet it must not he forgotten that this cause is advanced tuTOtiSN uutlldD cuOrtSs anu tndL IncSe eUOrIS must be augmented an hundred fold before the predictions of inspiration are fulfilled. There must yet be a mightier movement on the part of Christendom than has yet been made,-there must be more and greater sa- crifces,--a more entire cOnsecration of time and talents and wealth and inAuence,-and many new helpers must be called into the field; ere this great moral conquest is a. chieved.\n\n \"Lct then the friends of the bible, while inspired by the losses and promises here, un- l folded, go forward and diffuse this blessing at home and abroad, until it is proclaimed throughout every continent and island-that tue Kingdoms of this ,Uorld hGve become tue Kingdoms of fouv Lord and his Christ.

The Rev. Dr. Day, President of Yale College, commenced the exercise of the day by reading the 7th chapter of Micah. Letters were then read from several of the Vice Presidents apologising for their not being able to att tend the anniversary. Among these was one from the President of the United States, and one from the Hon. John Cot ton Smith, late Governor of Connecticut.\n\n His excellency Govern lr Clinton then rose and pronounced an address, introduc- tory to the exercises of the day, the deliv- cry of which occupied about eighteen min utes.

Observer gives the following account; after saying, that an appropriate sermon was delivered before the Legislature, by Rev. I. Lewis, jr. of Greenwich, from Micah G. 8.\n\n The anniversaries of the Connecticut Bible Society, and of the Domestic Mis- sionary Society of Connecticut, and the meeting of the General Convention of Connecticut were held on Wednesday. Among other resolutions was one recom- mending that contributions be taken up for the Colonization Society, on the Sab bath proceeding or following the fourth of July. We hope the subject will be at- tended to throug hout the state. The So- ciety is growing in popularity, and in re- sources-and promises to be the medium of unbounded good to the United States as we'll as to Africa.\n\n The sermon preached before the Do- mestic Missionary Society, was preached on \"Wednesday evening by Rev. MT. Ba- con, of New-Haven after which collec- ton of more than $6o was made for the Society.\n\n On Thursday morning a meeting was held, to consider the expediency of forming a state society auxiliary to tue American Colonization Society.-A statement of the origin, progress and prospects, of this Soci- ety was made by the Agent, Rev. Mir. Gurley and the meeting was addressed by Prof. Hall, Rev. MT. Linsley, s. Ter ry, Esq. & Rev. MT. Goodman, in sup port ofa resolution that it is expedient to form State Colonization Society in Con- necticut. The resolution was passed with great unanimity, and Committee was ap- pointed to report a Constitution for the Society, and to nominate officers, at a sub- sequent meeting.\n\n On the afternoon of Thursday, meet ing was held by the (\" Society for the Im- provement of Common Schools.\"'\n\n The Connecticut Sunday School Union held its anniversary in the Centre Church on Thurday evening, when the annual Re- port was read, and several resolutions, supported by able addresses from Rev. C.: A. Boardman, w. w. Ellsworth, Esq. Rev. H. N. Brinsmade, Rev. MT. Car rington, and Rev. Orrin Fowler, were passed.\n\n By these various meetings, an impulse has been given, we trust, to the cause of truth and benevolence, in the State\"\n\n For the Boston Recor der and Telegraph\n\n ANOTHER CALL TO ACTION. MEssRs. ED1ToRs,-Ift the community keep on drinking, until they can persuade tins importers of ardent spirits to give up the trade, and the distillers to burn their dis tilleries, fear we shall all become drunkards. The fact is, the importers and distillers will continue the business, as long as the public will keep them in coun- tenance, and no longer. Now if you wish to stop the importation or distillation of ardent spirits, leave off drinking. To be sure, the importer is willing to give up the trade if he can make nothing by it; and the grocer is willing to give up the trade, if there are no ardent spirits imported or distilled and the drunkard, even, will be willing to leave off drinking if he can't get any thing to drink. But which is most to blame, the importer, the distiller, the re- taller, or the tipler? That is the great question. And who shall stop first, is another almost as big.

Editors, since last addressed you, volley of Fast day Sermons has been discharged against the common enemy, and not without some effect. Some of the churches in this city, were half awaked, and, trust, that such another volley would bring them to stand upon their feet, and shake themselves from the reproach which has too long rested upon them. Let eve ry professing Christian say for himself, \"I have done with ardent spirits\" and the work will be half done. Let it no more be said, that such and such minister was seen to call at the bar of tavern, and tip off his glass with as good an air as the worst of us. Let it no more be said, that such and such professor may be good man, for aught we know, but he carries a red nose of his own, and we guess that, with all his religion, he would not stick at glass of brandy o, my brethren, let there be no more occasion for this reproach. Before conclude, I would say, that in my opinion there are some grocers in this city who are prepared to turn their liquor casks out of doors, and to give up the deal- ing in ardent spirits, altogether. And now, I call upon the friends of religion, the friends of their country, to look after them, and if there are any such to be found to patronize them. 5. ID.",

A committee from their number. in the course ofa few subsequent days, obtained from O. ther citizens subscription sufficient to extin guish the debt entirely.

The present Report states that other portions have been translated into the Mohawk tongue by some intelligent AbO- recently forwarded to the Society ny the Rev. Wm. Case, Methodist minister in Lower Canada, and is now in press.\n\n 4 valuable set of 8 vO. stereotype piates' ] with contents of chapters prefxed, has recent l ly been purchased of the Baltimore Bible SO- cietv, to be paid for in Bibles and Testa- ] ments.\n\n | Bibles issued from the DepOsitory.-During the year, there has been issued from the De- posltory S5, ,G76 Bibles and 8, ,745 Testaments. Total 71,G2l winch added, to 40, ,0l4 issu- ed in the ten proceeding years, make grand total of 51I.667. Of the issue of the last year, 53, 337 have in various ways been dispO- sed of to auxiliary and other Societies and individuals. A still greater number might have been sold, had the rules of the Society permitted sales to those who are not mem bers. The number of Bibles and Testaments gratuitously appropriated during the years, 13.286.\n\n Comparing these issues with those of the proceeding year, it will be seen that they are greater by 4.487; while the number printed. Is less by 4,266. It IS also observable that the number sold is greater, while the number gratuitously appropriated is less. This last fact is attributed, in the report, to two causes. I. That the Board have during the greater part oflast year, been wholly without trav- cling agents ;-cOnsequently few new Auxll- aries have been formed, to which donations of Bibles are usually made on. recognizing them as connected with the Society. 2. The Managers have hesltated whether more sparing policy in regard to such grants to Auxiliaries, ought rot to be tried. They however express their readiness, at all times when able, to make gratuitous grants where they are truly needed, and where there is known zeal in the Auxiliary to put them in circulation.\n\n Great complaints are again made of the want ofBibles, in different sections of our county. In one county, in the State of Del aware, 500 families are supposed to be destl- tute in North Carolina, 10000; in South Carolina, perha 3s an equal number; in GeOr- gia, and Teouessee, the same. In short, the whole Southern and Western parts of the Union are in like deplorable situation. The Society has had no travelling Agents during the past year.\n\n The Rev. Jonas King, late American Mis- si0nary to Palestine, is now in Paris. The Board have requested him to act as delegate of the American Bible Society to that of Pa ris on its ensuing anniversary; and also, if practicable, as Delegate to the British and Foreign Bible Society. ...\n\n The Report concludes as follows; {\" The events of every revolving year indicate that the systems of Pagan corruption and cruelty are ere long to be broken up, and the light and principles of the Gospel to prevade eve ry kindred. and tongue, and people. But be- fore such consummatiOn is realized, much, very much, remains to he done. Not more than forty or fifty million copies of revealed truth, are yet in circulation among the eight hundred millions of the great human family.\n\n \"While then the ultimate uniyersality of the SaviOr's cause is certain as Divine vera city can make it,-whie its onward march is smore and more rapid, (never so much SO perhaps since the ascension of it's Founder as during the past year,) yet it must not he forgotten that this cause is advanced tuTOtiSN uutlldD cuOrtSs anu tndL IncSe eUOrIS must be augmented an hundred fold before the predictions of inspiration are fulfilled.

The Rev. Dr. Day, President of Yale College, commenced the exercise of the day by reading the 7th chapter of Micah.

John Cot ton Smith, late Governor of Connecticut.\n\n His excellency Govern lr Clinton then rose and pronounced an address, introduc- tory to the exercises of the day, the deliv- cry of which occupied about eighteen min utes. Unfortunately the crowd was so great that we could not get near enough to hear it.

The audience, HOtwith- standing the untoward state of the weather. was crowded to excess, and the attention Of every one has been enchaincd for hours. Thus may it ever he at these interesting eel chr rations. May their number multiply, their means increase, and their moral influence be extended, until the light of the Gospel shines Ou every mountain, and Eliminates every val lev, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from Nova Zembla to Cape Horn !!\n\n ANNIVERSARIES AT HARTFORD.\n\n During the last week, at the time of the state election, several religious and benev- olent societies held their annual meetings at Hartford, of which the Conn. Observer gives the following account; after saying, that an appropriate sermon was delivered before the Legislature, by Rev. I. Lewis, jr. of Greenwich, from Micah G. 8.\n\n The anniversaries of the Connecticut Bible Society, and of the Domestic Mis- sionary Society of Connecticut, and the meeting of the General Convention of Connecticut were held on Wednesday. Among other resolutions was one recom- mending that contributions be taken up for the Colonization Society, on the Sab bath proceeding or following the fourth of July. We hope the subject will be at- tended to throug hout the state. The So- ciety is growing in popularity, and in re- sources-and promises to be the medium of unbounded good to the United States as we'll as to Africa.\n\n The sermon preached before the Do- mestic Missionary Society, was preached on \"Wednesday evening by Rev. MT. Ba- con, of New-Haven after which collec- ton of more than $6o was made for the Society.\n\n On Thursday morning a meeting was held, to consider the expediency of forming a state society auxiliary to tue American Colonization Society.-A statement of the origin, progress and prospects, of this Soci- ety was made by the Agent, Rev. Mir. Gurley and the meeting was addressed by Prof. Hall, Rev. MT. Linsley, s. Ter ry, Esq. & Rev. MT. Goodman, in sup port ofa resolution that it is expedient to form State Colonization Society in Con- necticut. The resolution was passed with great unanimity, and Committee was ap- pointed to report a Constitution for the Society, and to nominate officers, at a sub- sequent meeting.\n\n On the afternoon of Thursday, meet ing was held by the (\" Society for the Im- provement of Common Schools.\"'\n\n The Connecticut Sunday School Union held its anniversary in the Centre Church on Thurday evening, when the annual Re- port was read, and several resolutions, supported by able addresses from Rev. C.: A. Boardman, w. w. Ellsworth, Esq. Rev. H. N. Brinsmade, Rev. MT. Car rington, and Rev. Orrin Fowler, were passed.\n\n By these various meetings, an impulse has been given, we trust, to the cause of truth and benevolence, in the State\"\n\n For the Boston Recor der and Telegraph\n\n ANOTHER CALL TO ACTION. MEssRs. ED1ToRs,-Ift the community keep on drinking, until they can persuade tins importers of ardent spirits to give up the trade, and the distillers to burn their dis tilleries, fear we shall all become drunkards. The fact is, the importers and distillers will continue the business, as long as the public will keep them in coun- tenance, and no longer. Now if you wish to stop the importation or distillation of ardent spirits, leave off drinking. To be sure, the importer is willing to give up the trade if he can make nothing by it; and the grocer is willing to give up the trade, if there are no ardent spirits imported or distilled and the drunkard, even, will be willing to leave off drinking if he can't get any thing to drink. But which is most to blame, the importer, the distiller, the re- taller, or the tipler? That is the great question. And who shall stop first, is another almost as big.
