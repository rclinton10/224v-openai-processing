Also, Mad am, you would soon be little less plump; for nothing has such an effect in that matter as early rising. It tends both to diminish what is superfluous, and to add to what is desirable in point of size be- cause nothing tends so much to put the frame in the healthiest condition.

In good health the frame is contented with a suficiency. The blood has its natural current, and does not require to be push ed on even to uneasiness, as is sometimes the case in states of hamilton, or when one state of fever can only be replaced by another.

They are with cred, but they are also preserved and appear to advantage in the freshest com- pany.\n\n A word to the other sex, now that our fair friend is gone. Ninon de rEnclos told women to beware of the corpulent and the course-handed. Perhaps had she liv- ed in naval and commercial country, she would have sunk the latter objection but Love and Obesity, as the poet says of an another parsonage, certainly do not all we'll on the same bench.\n\n \"Non bene conveniunt, nee in una se- de morantur, Majestas ct Amor\" Hume, sitting on sofa between the ladies at Paris, was spectacle more un- be6ting his philosophy than he himself thought. A philosopher has no more bu- siness with so much fat, than a lover. 1t 1 is said of Gibbon, that when he made love ] to MademoiselleCu Curchod, and went down upon his knees, she was obliged to ring the bell for the footman to help him up again. It was certainly chivilrous step for him to take. He could not well do more for her, or get into worse scrape. It was his Knee plus ultra. The lady and he were the Decline and Fall. It is pi- ty that so many good fellows have con- sented to get fat, and make verses and proverbs in favor of it. There may be said, in this country, to be fat supersti- ton though it has been going out of late years, since bad nerves came up, and the French are no longer to be laughed at for the megerness they enjoyed under the old regime. The magic Frenchman was deplorable enough but the corpulent En. glishman was not much better. In old age he had by far the worst of it. Observe a corpulent old gallant, who has been hand- some fellow in his younger days: how hard he tries to brace himself in, and retain his elegance! And it is by no means the worst thing he does. He has turn for an ele- gance still, though he has not been grace full enough to preserve it. His brother el- ders are not so much his superiors as they think, in carrying their obesity with indif- ference. They are enormous and not a. shamed. In proper state of society, in which right and wrong were better under- stood than they are now, and better stress laid on the duties of health and chearful- ness, corpulence would be reckoned dis graceful.\n\n ",

GENERAL JAcKsON.-In our last, we gave a slight sketch of the abductiOns of Mrs. Roberts, now Mrs. General Jackson and are now enabled, through the agency of Charles J. Hammond, Esq. the very able editor of the Cincinnati Gazette, to lay the particulars of the whole case before the public. The facts that we now adduce, and the testimony we offer are matters of nOtoriety and record. From these documents, it will be seen, that Lewis Robberts the legal husband of Rachel, did, in the year 179O, obtain decree, dissolv- ing the bonds of matrimony, previously exist ing between him and his wife, and that the decree was granted on proof being adduced that she did elope from her husband, and lived in open adultry with another man,\n\n Gen. JacksOn.] But as the documents to which we refer, will prove far more sat- isfactory to the reader, than any thing we can say, we hasten to spread them before the world, together with the verdict of the jury.\n\n ''In the summer of 179O, Gen. Jackson prevailed on the wife of Lewis Roberts of Mercer county Kentucky to desert her hus- 1 band, and live with himself in the charac- l ter of wife.\n\n Kentucky was then part of the state of Virginia. Roberts applied to the Legislature for divorce. Upon that application a law was passed entitled \" An act concerning the mar riage of Le,Ois Roberts\" This law passed Dec. %, 179O, and may be found In the 18th vol. of Hemings Virginia statutes at large. It authorized certain judicial proceedings to be had in the District of Kentucky, between Rob- erts and his wife to ascertain the facts of de- sertion and adutery--and provided that If the jury, in case of issue joined, shall find for the plaintiff, or, in case ofinqury into the truth of the allegations contained in the declara- ton, shall find that the defendant hath de- serted the plaintiff, and that she hath lived in adultery with another man since such deser- ton, the said verdict shall be recorded, and thereupon the marriage between the said Lewis Roberts and Rachel shall be dissolved. Legal pEOCCCOluoS were iuStltuteu uuueT LNlS law. A declaration was filled charging that ''the said Rachel, in violation of her most sol- emn promise, did, on the 1st day of July. in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety, elope from her said hus- band Lewis, and lived in adultery with anoth- CT man, and still continues with the adulter- er.\" The attorney who filled and subscribed this declaration, was James Brown. our pres ent Minister to France.\n\n At the September term of the Court Q. S.. Mercer County, Kentucky, jury composed ofBradsberry, Thomas Smith, Gabriel Slaugh- ter, John LightfOot, Samuel Work, Harrison\n\n Davis, John Ray, Obadiah Wright, John Wiles, John Meaux, Joseph Thomas, and\n\n Benjamin Lewis, were empannelled and sworn\n\n ''well and truly to inquire into the allegations in the plaintiffs declaration specified\" Hugh ] M'Gary was sworn and examined as a witness -and the jury returned verdict in these words ;-\"We, the jury, do find that the de- fendant, Rachel Roberts, hath deserted the plaintiff, Lewis Roberts. and hath, and doth still live in adultery with another man. John Iightfoot, foreman\" This verdict was re- corded, and the marriage dissolved. The record of this inquiry, verdict and judg- ment, may be found in the records of q. s. Court for Mercer county. No. l, for Septcm- Der, 1792, to September, l796. The Rachel Roberts, who was the defendant, is Mrs. Gen. Jaskson.\n\n Ishould not have detailed these facts,a at this ] time, but for call from the Advertiser. And | it must be remembered that the subject, so far as am concerned, was first introduced in- to papers by certain Jackson Editors of this city, during the last autumn-and for the pur- pose of defaming my character. It would seem that my fobearance then to publish wha,\n\n is now published has been misunderstood ;-\n\n and an inference drawn that the fact did not exist, or that was afraid to publish them. Their tendency to affect the fair fame' ol tone of the purest characters of which the U- nited States can boast\" is, for the present left without cement or remak.\n\n Whether Gen. Jackson after possessing him. self of Mrs. Roberts became her lawful hus- or net, we cannot say, but it is certain that for more than twenty years he lived with her in open defiance ofthe laws of the land and of morality. We know, that he never married her, and we still further know, that that o. pinion, until within few years, shut the door of decent society against her.\n\n It would seem from the proceedings of the case, Lewis Roberts us. his Wife, that she willingly and ofher own free will and accord eloped, and became the partner of Gen.

We assert, without fear of contradiction, that such caucus was held; that it was composed of materials the most ln- cOngruOus and heretofore discOrdant-OfFed- eralists. of Quids of Democrats Of divers sorts -that it was therefore convened, not upon the ground of a common sentiment on great fundamental rrincipLes. such as heretofore has been held to justify caucusses, but upon the ground ofa common object,strOnger even than the repugnance OfthOse who composed it to one another, (and Heaven knows how strong must have been the attractive influence to counteract the natural lrepulsiOn between some of them.) We have the names of most of these gentlemen, but We shall drag no names unnecessarily before the public. We should not have used even Mir. Van Buren's name in this discussion, had he not placed himself conspicuously in the van, and had it not been that he evidently deserved the honor, which the Advocate claimed for him, of being the .Master Spirit\" by whose agency this eau GUS machinery was put in operation.\n\n The operations in regard to the public press began here by the prescription of the Nation al Intelligencer. by u political inquisition.- They carried on elsewhereb by different means. In some cases by direct menace,as in the case of the Harrisburgh Inteligencer; in others, by an operation of a different sort. which some times succeeds, and sometimes does not. In other instances, we find presses rising like ex- halations, blazing for awhile, and which, expiring for the lack of aliment, will soon leave nothing but an offensive odOurby which to remember their existence.\n\n Our object, however, is not at this time to fatigue our readers by asking them to go over again all the ground we have already trodden with them, but to place before them, in few words, the conclusions to which we have been led by our investigations. which are as fol- lows:-\n\n That there exists an organized Opposition to\n\n this Administration, right or wrong, which,\n\n though chiefly observable in Congress, is\n\n connected very extensively with the pub\n\n lie Press.\n\n That public measures have consequently been\n\n decided in Congress, upon the principle of\n\n party expediency. and with reference to\n\n the Presidential Election, rather than to the\n\n respective merits of those measures. That an influence has been visible in the Sem\n\n atorial branch of Congress, different from\n\n the influence of purely Constitutional con-\n\n alterations.\n\n That rumor imputes the influence to the de-\n\n cisions of a small Caucus or Junta, occa-\n\n sionally held in :his city, whose procee-\n\n dings have been wrapt in the profoundest\n\n privacy.\n\n That contemporaneous publications in New\n\n York, and communications to journalists\n\n in Richmond, make boast of this Organi-\n\n Zation.\n\n That, though the main purposes of this Com\n\n bination here is the regulation of the Presi-\n\n dential Election, it has other and subsidiary\n\n purposes.\n\n That one ofthese purposes is the subjugation\n\n ofthe press by means unknown to the law\n\n and inconsistent with principle.\n\n That the effect of the success of these opera\n\n tions would be to place the government of\n\n the United States in the hands of an organi-\n\n zed and disciplined party. instead of the\n\n hands ofthe legitimate sovereign, the Peo-\n\n pie.\n\n That the Hon. Martin Van Buren, a Senator\n\n from New-York, represents this party, and\n\n is necessarily the life and soul, and bone\n\n and sinew of it.\n\n That the success of this organization would\n\n be, therefore, necessarily, to place the whole\n\n ofthe routine of the high public offices, and\n\n all the important legislation of the country,\n\n under the absolute control of that distin-\n\n guished citizen.\n\n That such success would he an usurpation of\n\n the rights of the People, and a tyranny of\n\n odiOus complexion.\n\n Whether our deductions are just or other wise. is for our readers to decide, and for the present We willingly leave the question with them. Whether the concerns of this great nation are to be placed under the control of National Caucus, anticipating and superseding the ordinary forms of legislation, as well as the process of a free popular election, is grave question which we call upon the People of the United States to examine and decide That the attempt has been made to introduce this system into the General Government, there can be no doubt. Emboldened by par tal success, the Senate of the United States, subjected to the dominion of this system. has been exultngly proclaimed the controlling power of the Government, and even the ex- animation the Speech of a member of the boasted majority of that body has heen pro- duced as dangerous breach of privilege.- We shall see, in the result, whether these cor ruptions of our political system-these high toned aristocratic principles-this combination of secret purposes, with boasted power and asserted privilege, will be countenanced by the appreciation of an intelligent People, or will receive their indignant condemnation.",

We know not what topic of interest other than the District Bill he will touch upon; but we presume the document will do honour to the sound judgment and liberal views of this in- teIligent statesman. The election sermon Was to have, and we doubt not has, been preached by Rev. Mr Lewis, of Greenwich. Speaking upon this subject the Register re- marks, \"There is no propriety in keeping up this legislative preaching, and singing, and id- ding. and negro dancing, &c. on the first day of the session.\" We do not know what con- nection there is between preaching and me- gro-dancing,' and until informed by Mr Bar ber were ignorant that these were combined nuisances which moral people should be freed from! Agreeably to Mir Barber's ad vice, the state may submit to this hydra of evils one year longer, because '' MT Wheaton has already been appointed to preach the elec- ton sermon for lss8,\" and then let the prin- cipal head of the monster by cut of! \"let there be no more legislative preaching after 1828.\" We trust the political Hercules who shall undertake to follow this sage advice will be able to find an Iolus to scar the wound so that two greater evils may not spring up in lieu of the one. But here the work of refor- nation would of necessity stop, for even the governor with all his councillors has not pow CT to suppress ''singing, fiiddling, and negro daocing;' other powers than an executive or legislative must be brought to bear against them; moral inAuence,-which we have been told the enemies of \"preaching\" seldom exert with much effect-can only restrain the remaining evils.\n\n Late intelligence from Europe states that the Porte obstinately refuses to be in- 6uenced by the mediation of the Christian European powers, in their overtures fer the paci6cation of Greece. From the known character of the Turks, we are led to sup- pose there is some foundation for this re- port. A sort of sovereign contempt to- wards thepowers of Europe, ,and an exalted idea of its own power, would naturally in- duce the Porte to reject with disdain every proposition which might be made to better the condition of Greece. We shall re- ioice if such is the result of the late nego- tiations with that abandoned power. Had she acceded to these overtures, made prin- cipally by England and France, Greece would have been bettered from her condi- tion previous to the breaking out of tue war; but still her liberty would have been so only in the name. She would have been tributary to Turkey, and continually subject to insult and outrage from the Va cillating policy of that power. But should the Grand Turk persist in the resolution that nothing but abject slavery or death shall await Greece from his hands, those powers which proposed mediation will be constrained to say that the Porte shall carry on the war single handed-that Ibra- him of Egypt shall call home his fleets aud armies, and not interfere in contest which does not concern him. Two years he has carried on the war, and all he has received in exchange for the thousands of men he has lost and the millions he has expended, is few Greek heads and ears !-Greece has defended herself against the combined forces of Turkey and Egypt let the lat- ter be warned from the 6eld,-a warning which, in his present embarrassed situation, Ibrahim would deem it policy to obey.- and the former would fast dwindle before the feroc;ous bravery of their injured ene- my. Better days are dawning upon Greece. The time is coming when she will again rank among the nations of the earth; and we trust that the recent movements of Christian Europe will have tendency to hasten thisevent SO devoutly to be wished.\n\n Seed COrn.-A writer in late New.

Besides i; was she not Venus grant you she went to bed early but SO could other beauties, if they did not lie late. know what you are going to say,-the pain-the difficulty the astonishment of the servants-the delicious wilful nap-the warm sun to get up by (if any) the warm fire at all events -the leisure-the snugness-the satisfac- tion-perhaps the coffee in bed, and some- times the novel.-Madam, have gone through with all this myself and perhaps should never have got out of its if it had not been for the i'll effect which am sure to feel if I lie late 7; and which renders early rising in me less meritorious than in any body know. You, for instance, who experience no i'll effect at present from lying too late (though unquestiona- bly, it adds every day something to what you would regret by and by) would have great merit in getting up. Also, Mad am, you would soon be little less plump; for nothing has such an effect in that matter as early rising. It tends both to diminish what is superfluous, and to add to what is desirable in point of size be- cause nothing tends so much to put the frame in the healthiest condition. As to what I meant by the additional pleas ure at breakfast, it is this :: that although eating too much is to be deprecated in every one, eating heartily and with an appetite becomes every body in good health, man or woman and l. have in- -xaribly observed, that therhealIhiest ap- 'petites, though harty and proper ones, and by far the most enjoying, are by no mean. the most craving or contnued.- Hunger of that inveterate sort is as Ack- ly in its way as want of appetite. In good health the frame is contented with a suficiency. The blood has its natural current, and does not require to be push ed on even to uneasiness, as is sometimes the case in states of hamilton, or when one state of fever can only be replaced by another.

Lively good humored old women are what raisins are to fresh grapes. They are with cred, but they are also preserved and appear to advantage in the freshest com- pany.\n\n A word to the other sex, now that our fair friend is gone. Ninon de rEnclos told women to beware of the corpulent and the course-handed. Perhaps had she liv- ed in naval and commercial country, she would have sunk the latter objection but Love and Obesity, as the poet says of an another parsonage, certainly do not all we'll on the same bench.\n\n \"Non bene conveniunt, nee in una se- de morantur, Majestas ct Amor\" Hume, sitting on sofa between the ladies at Paris, was spectacle more un- be6ting his philosophy than he himself thought. A philosopher has no more bu- siness with so much fat, than a lover. 1t 1 is said of Gibbon, that when he made love ] to MademoiselleCu Curchod, and went down upon his knees, she was obliged to ring the bell for the footman to help him up again. It was certainly chivilrous step for him to take. He could not well do more for her, or get into worse scrape. It was his Knee plus ultra. The lady and he were the Decline and Fall. It is pi- ty that so many good fellows have con- sented to get fat, and make verses and proverbs in favor of it. There may be said, in this country, to be fat supersti- ton though it has been going out of late years, since bad nerves came up, and the French are no longer to be laughed at for the megerness they enjoyed under the old regime. The magic Frenchman was deplorable enough but the corpulent En. glishman was not much better. In old age he had by far the worst of it. Observe a corpulent old gallant, who has been hand- some fellow in his younger days: how hard he tries to brace himself in, and retain his elegance! And it is by no means the worst thing he does. He has turn for an ele- gance still, though he has not been grace full enough to preserve it. His brother el- ders are not so much his superiors as they think, in carrying their obesity with indif- ference. They are enormous and not a. shamed. In proper state of society, in which right and wrong were better under- stood than they are now, and better stress laid on the duties of health and chearful- ness, corpulence would be reckoned dis graceful.\n\n ",

From these documents, it will be seen, that Lewis Robberts the legal husband of Rachel, did, in the year 179O, obtain decree, dissolv- ing the bonds of matrimony, previously exist ing between him and his wife, and that the decree was granted on proof being adduced that she did elope from her husband, and lived in open adultry with another man,\n\n Gen. JacksOn.] But as the documents to which we refer, will prove far more sat- isfactory to the reader, than any thing we can say, we hasten to spread them before the world, together with the verdict of the jury.\n\n ''In the summer of 179O, Gen. Jackson prevailed on the wife of Lewis Roberts of Mercer county Kentucky to desert her hus- 1 band, and live with himself in the charac- l ter of wife.\n\n Kentucky was then part of the state of Virginia. Roberts applied to the Legislature for divorce. Upon that application a law was passed entitled \" An act concerning the mar riage of Le,Ois Roberts\" This law passed Dec. %, 179O, and may be found In the 18th vol. of Hemings Virginia statutes at large. It authorized certain judicial proceedings to be had in the District of Kentucky, between Rob- erts and his wife to ascertain the facts of de- sertion and adutery--and provided that If the jury, in case of issue joined, shall find for the plaintiff, or, in case ofinqury into the truth of the allegations contained in the declara- ton, shall find that the defendant hath de- serted the plaintiff, and that she hath lived in adultery with another man since such deser- ton, the said verdict shall be recorded, and thereupon the marriage between the said Lewis Roberts and Rachel shall be dissolved. Legal pEOCCCOluoS were iuStltuteu uuueT LNlS law. A declaration was filled charging that ''the said Rachel, in violation of her most sol- emn promise, did, on the 1st day of July. in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety, elope from her said hus- band Lewis, and lived in adultery with anoth- CT man, and still continues with the adulter- er.\" The attorney who filled and subscribed this declaration, was James Brown. our pres ent Minister to France.\n\n At the September term of the Court Q. S.. Mercer County, Kentucky, jury composed ofBradsberry, Thomas Smith, Gabriel Slaugh- ter, John LightfOot, Samuel Work, Harrison\n\n Davis, John Ray, Obadiah Wright, John Wiles, John Meaux, Joseph Thomas, and\n\n Benjamin Lewis, were empannelled and sworn\n\n ''well and truly to inquire into the allegations in the plaintiffs declaration specified\" Hugh ] M'Gary was sworn and examined as a witness -and the jury returned verdict in these words ;-\"We, the jury, do find that the de- fendant, Rachel Roberts, hath deserted the plaintiff, Lewis Roberts. and hath, and doth still live in adultery with another man. John Iightfoot, foreman\" This verdict was re- corded, and the marriage dissolved. The record of this inquiry, verdict and judg- ment, may be found in the records of q. s. Court for Mercer county. No. l, for Septcm- Der, 1792, to September, l796. The Rachel Roberts, who was the defendant, is Mrs. Gen. Jaskson.\n\n Ishould not have detailed these facts,a at this ] time, but for call from the Advertiser. And | it must be remembered that the subject, so far as am concerned, was first introduced in- to papers by certain Jackson Editors of this city, during the last autumn-and for the pur- pose of defaming my character. It would seem that my fobearance then to publish wha,\n\n is now published has been misunderstood ;-\n\n and an inference drawn that the fact did not exist, or that was afraid to publish them. Their tendency to affect the fair fame' ol tone of the purest characters of which the U- nited States can boast\" is, for the present left without cement or remak.\n\n Whether Gen. Jackson after possessing him. self of Mrs. Roberts became her lawful hus- or net, we cannot say, but it is certain that for more than twenty years he lived with her in open defiance ofthe laws of the land and of morality. We know, that he never married her, and we still further know, that that o. pinion, until within few years, shut the door of decent society against her.\n\n It would seem from the proceedings of the case, Lewis Roberts us. his Wife, that she willingly and ofher own free will and accord eloped, and became the partner of Gen. Jack sons bed. Such is not the fact, it is suscepti- ble of proof, that at the dead hour of mid",

We assert, without fear of contradiction, that such caucus was held; that it was composed of materials the most ln- cOngruOus and heretofore discOrdant-OfFed- eralists. of Quids of Democrats Of divers sorts -that it was therefore convened, not upon the ground of a common sentiment on great fundamental rrincipLes. such as heretofore has been held to justify caucusses, but upon the ground ofa common object,strOnger even than the repugnance OfthOse who composed it to one another, (and Heaven knows how strong must have been the attractive influence to counteract the natural lrepulsiOn between some of them.) We have the names of most of these gentlemen, but We shall drag no names unnecessarily before the public. We should not have used even Mir. Van Buren's name in this discussion, had he not placed himself conspicuously in the van, and had it not been that he evidently deserved the honor, which the Advocate claimed for him, of being the .Master Spirit\" by whose agency this eau GUS machinery was put in operation.\n\n The operations in regard to the public press began here by the prescription of the Nation al Intelligencer. by u political inquisition.- They carried on elsewhereb by different means. In some cases by direct menace,as in the case of the Harrisburgh Inteligencer; in others, by an operation of a different sort. which some times succeeds, and sometimes does not. In other instances, we find presses rising like ex- halations, blazing for awhile, and which, expiring for the lack of aliment, will soon leave nothing but an offensive odOurby which to remember their existence.\n\n Our object, however, is not at this time to fatigue our readers by asking them to go over again all the ground we have already trodden with them, but to place before them, in few words, the conclusions to which we have been led by our investigations. which are as fol- lows:-\n\n That there exists an organized Opposition to\n\n this Administration, right or wrong, which,\n\n though chiefly observable in Congress, is\n\n connected very extensively with the pub\n\n lie Press.\n\n That public measures have consequently been\n\n decided in Congress, upon the principle of\n\n party expediency. and with reference to\n\n the Presidential Election, rather than to the\n\n respective merits of those measures. That an influence has been visible in the Sem\n\n atorial branch of Congress, different from\n\n the influence of purely Constitutional con-\n\n alterations.\n\n That rumor imputes the influence to the de-\n\n cisions of a small Caucus or Junta, occa-\n\n sionally held in :his city, whose procee-\n\n dings have been wrapt in the profoundest\n\n privacy.\n\n That contemporaneous publications in New\n\n York, and communications to journalists\n\n in Richmond, make boast of this Organi-\n\n Zation.\n\n That, though the main purposes of this Com\n\n bination here is the regulation of the Presi-\n\n dential Election, it has other and subsidiary\n\n purposes.\n\n That one ofthese purposes is the subjugation\n\n ofthe press by means unknown to the law\n\n and inconsistent with principle.\n\n That the effect of the success of these opera\n\n tions would be to place the government of\n\n the United States in the hands of an organi-\n\n zed and disciplined party. instead of the\n\n hands ofthe legitimate sovereign, the Peo-\n\n pie.\n\n That the Hon. Martin Van Buren, a Senator\n\n from New-York, represents this party, and\n\n is necessarily the life and soul, and bone\n\n and sinew of it.\n\n That the success of this organization would\n\n be, therefore, necessarily, to place the whole\n\n ofthe routine of the high public offices, and\n\n all the important legislation of the country,\n\n under the absolute control of that distin-\n\n guished citizen.\n\n That such success would he an usurpation of\n\n the rights of the People, and a tyranny of\n\n odiOus complexion.\n\n Whether our deductions are just or other wise. is for our readers to decide, and for the present We willingly leave the question with them. Whether the concerns of this great nation are to be placed under the control of National Caucus, anticipating and superseding the ordinary forms of legislation, as well as the process of a free popular election, is grave question which we call upon the People of the United States to examine and decide That the attempt has been made to introduce this system into the General Government, there can be no doubt. Emboldened by par tal success, the Senate of the United States, subjected to the dominion of this system. has been exultngly proclaimed the controlling power of the Government, and even the ex- animation the Speech of a member of the boasted majority of that body has heen pro- duced as dangerous breach of privilege.- We shall see, in the result, whether these cor ruptions of our political system-these high toned aristocratic principles-this combination of secret purposes, with boasted power and asserted privilege, will be countenanced by the appreciation of an intelligent People, or will receive their indignant condemnation.",

We know not what topic of interest other than the District Bill he will touch upon; but we presume the document will do honour to the sound judgment and liberal views of this in- teIligent statesman. The election sermon Was to have, and we doubt not has, been preached by Rev. Mr Lewis, of Greenwich. Speaking upon this subject the Register re- marks, \"There is no propriety in keeping up this legislative preaching, and singing, and id- ding. and negro dancing, &c. on the first day of the session.\" We do not know what con- nection there is between preaching and me- gro-dancing,' and until informed by Mr Bar ber were ignorant that these were combined nuisances which moral people should be freed from! Agreeably to Mir Barber's ad vice, the state may submit to this hydra of evils one year longer, because '' MT Wheaton has already been appointed to preach the elec- ton sermon for lss8,\" and then let the prin- cipal head of the monster by cut of! \"let there be no more legislative preaching after 1828.\" We trust the political Hercules who shall undertake to follow this sage advice will be able to find an Iolus to scar the wound so that two greater evils may not spring up in lieu of the one. But here the work of refor- nation would of necessity stop, for even the governor with all his councillors has not pow CT to suppress ''singing, fiiddling, and negro daocing;' other powers than an executive or legislative must be brought to bear against them; moral inAuence,-which we have been told the enemies of \"preaching\" seldom exert with much effect-can only restrain the remaining evils.\n\n Late intelligence from Europe states that the Porte obstinately refuses to be in- 6uenced by the mediation of the Christian European powers, in their overtures fer the paci6cation of Greece. From the known character of the Turks, we are led to sup- pose there is some foundation for this re- port. A sort of sovereign contempt to- wards thepowers of Europe, ,and an exalted idea of its own power, would naturally in- duce the Porte to reject with disdain every proposition which might be made to better the condition of Greece. We shall re- ioice if such is the result of the late nego- tiations with that abandoned power. Had she acceded to these overtures, made prin- cipally by England and France, Greece would have been bettered from her condi- tion previous to the breaking out of tue war; but still her liberty would have been so only in the name. She would have been tributary to Turkey, and continually subject to insult and outrage from the Va cillating policy of that power. But should the Grand Turk persist in the resolution that nothing but abject slavery or death shall await Greece from his hands, those powers which proposed mediation will be constrained to say that the Porte shall carry on the war single handed-that Ibra- him of Egypt shall call home his fleets aud armies, and not interfere in contest which does not concern him. Two years he has carried on the war, and all he has received in exchange for the thousands of men he has lost and the millions he has expended, is few Greek heads and ears !-Greece has defended herself against the combined forces of Turkey and Egypt let the lat- ter be warned from the 6eld,-a warning which, in his present embarrassed situation, Ibrahim would deem it policy to obey.- and the former would fast dwindle before the feroc;ous bravery of their injured ene- my. Better days are dawning upon Greece. The time is coming when she will again rank among the nations of the earth; and we trust that the recent movements of Christian Europe will have tendency to hasten thisevent SO devoutly to be wished.\n\n Seed COrn.-A writer in late New.
