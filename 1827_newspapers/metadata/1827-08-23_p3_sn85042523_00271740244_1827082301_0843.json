The stones\nare brought from Port Deposit in sloops, to\nthe western point OF the canal. and are then\ncarried to the places where they are wanted\non the line, in Wagons.

The gal\nlows was so constructed that all three\nwere to be fastened to as many staples\nin the horizontal bar above at once; and the\nplatform, by means Of hinges, was to be sud-\ndenly removed from under them.

Capt, Hull Immediately\ncleared his ship tor action, double shotted\nthe guns, hoisred the broad pendant and the\nAmerican colours, and said to his chict Off\nGERS: IH see if he will fire into me, The\nfrigate was soon under way, with tomkins\nout and matches lighted, and sailed close to\nthe Castle without receiving shot. But a\nboat was sent by Gen. Rodl to Capt Hull,\nwith an ahology. which he accepted, and\nthe frigate returned to her former anchoring\nground. No doubt existed in the minds Of\nany of the officers of Capt. Hull, that a se-\nverc engagement would ensue, if the frigate\nwas fred upon.-- 1homasftn Reg.\n\n\nO6acrUationS on the heat ofths Atmoshhere.\n\n\n1t ltappears from various observations re-\npeatcd in the NJ sspapers, that the heat has\nbeen extreme, and even intolerablc in vari-\nGus parts Of the United States, from the 1st\nto the 10th Of the present month Of August.\nIn New York, on the 9th, the thermometer\nrose, in the shade, to 98 degrees Of Fahren.\nheit, and did not vary much in the night,\nand from the 1st to the 9th it had f1uctuated\nfrom Sc to SO at noon, and from 78 to 81 at\nnight.\n\n\nThis uncommon phenomenon may be at\ntributed to the following concurrent causes\n\n\n1st. To the opposition Of the whole disc\nOf the moon, or, in other words, TO the full\nness of that planet, during the above men\ntoned period.\n\n\n:. To the more vertical position Of the\nsun over the equator during the same peri\nod\n\n\n8. To the moon being in her perigee, that\nis several degrees nearer to the earth dur\ning the same period.\n\n\nAs the moon shines with no other light,\nbut with the radiant matter she reflects\nfrom the sun, and as that from the moon to\nthe earth, is made sensible not only by the\nlight it diffuses but by the caloric it con-\ntans, attested by optical experiments, and\nby its known operative effect on vegetation,\nit follows Of course, that more abundant\nquantity Of that matter having been reverb\nGrated on tho earth at night, aud the rays oil\nthe sun having fallen almost vertically upon\nus, during the same period, it is not to be\nwondered if VIC have experienced an un.\ncommon degree of heat in the day, and We\nry little refreshment while the sun illumcd\nthe other half of our tcrraqueous globe.\n\n\nAt the decline OF the moon, that is, when\nthe opposition ceases, and when the earth\novershadows the moon, our good citizens\nand their amiabe companions may expect\nmore comfortable days and pleasant nights\n\n\nNJ X.
