            "raw_text": "Information vas received in London on the evening of November A. through the French papers, in which\n\n it said that Ibrahm hosted the white fag[see No. W of the official despatches before sunset the time prescribed by the Admras and if he did 1t would appear that he inclined submit at least for the moment. This news, if true, is likewise important though it is not impossible it is nevertheless very doubtful. The most authentic uH-ofhcial accounts, state that Ibrahm not at Navarn at the time of the battle having been engaged for fortnight in the interior of the Morea, pursuing the Christians Tn the mountains of Messenla, attending the execution of some priests, whom he had crucIfied on some olive trees, making hoocauss of poor peasantry, pack ages of young girls and infants, send into Egypt, and laying the country waste by fire and sword root\n\n ing up the olives, vines, 6g-trees, &c. &c.\n\n The Editor of the Morning Herald apprehends that his conduct would be regulated by the of his store. If his provisions short it would be that he could have other alternative than pend hostilties precpate the total destruction of his troops by famine. II, however, statement in the French papers, protesting to be founded on letters from Zante, dated Oct. 25th may be relied on, the hoistng of the white flag by the Egyptian command CT is out of question. According to this sateme mt, Ibrahim Pacha, on being informed of the memora- be events of the Both, had retreated to Coron and had caused all the Greek prisoners, men, women, & children, who had been in his power for the last l5 months, to be put to death by the sword According to the priests aud other persons devoted to !igion, were crucfed, or burnt by slow fire. The de aIis given on ths subject make one shudder but every thing that the last hour of the Egyp tan tyger approaches. The English, French and R ssian flags, have been flying the walls of Maya rlno since the 24th. ModeD must now be in the pow CT of the Triple Alliance The Herald adds, how ever, that the above intelligence appears to of a doubtful character. If it be true it is quite clear l.\n\n brahm, determined not to surrender, and we do not see how the sangunary monster can be drven out of the Morea, without troops are employed against him. Indeed, it is said that troops will be mlnedi- atey forwarded the iIorea from Gibraltar and the British possessions in the Mediterranean. Private letters from Paris also state that the minister of ma rne had issued orders for the fitting out of several l ships of the line for the Mediterranean\"\n\n But the good news does not stop here. Mir. Ey- nard, the Chairman of the Greek Committee of Swift zerand, writes from Beaulieu Nov. 8, that he has re- ceived official confirmation ofthe account of the Greek fleet having burnt in the Gulf of Iepanto six Turkish brigs, and taken three Austrian transports.\n\n The Morning Herald of Nov. l5, announces the ar- rival of Mir. Lindsay, with despaches from Vienna, and of lord Ingesrie from Navarino Mir. l.. left Vi- enna on the 9th November The news of the battle of Navarino had reached that city the day before. Previous to Mir. Linsey's departure, the British Am bassador had an interview with Prince Metternch : the result of which interview Mir. l.. has of brought with him. It is understood that the Austrian Cabinet approves--or rather does not complan--o! the destruction of the Austrian transports engaged in the service of the Pacha of Egypt. With respect 10 ,he adyices which Mir. Lindsay brings r. lave the Porte, it is understood that more pacific disposition 1 has begun manifest itself in the Dvan. Al the date, however, of the advices, it should be remem-\n\n bered that the Porte ignorant of the destruction of the Egyptian fleet. What effect this event will\n\n have on the councils of the Sutan and apon the pas\n\n sions of the Turks remain to be seen.\n\n The Constitutionnel says \"the destruction of the fleet by the Allied powers must be serious that the\n\n shrewdest and penetrating mind cannot calculate ] on it's consequences. There can be no temerlty in\n\n anticipating real against Turkey, and the de-\n\n structon of that barbarous empre which has been so\n\n ong wished for by the sincere and enghned friends l of humanity, who wish for the independence and \\ dignity If iu1i IduaIs and natons.p H'Ihe news\n\n says the paper another place must fall like\n\n thunderbolt upon the Dyan-and particularly upon ! the Grand Segnor; and have we no reason to teaI\n\n that in the first of his fury, he may not sci\n\n bounds to his vengeance aud cruelty Precautions il ! is said are taken in favor of those Europeans who\n\n are Tn the capital of the Ottoman empire; but what\n\n precautions can resist the wrath of despot by whose\n\n nod thousands of heads leap frO the'r shoulders Or",

It was moved by Mir. Taylor to amend the Journal but the mo- ton was negatived by vote of IO1 to 68. A subsequent motion was made hy MT. Taylor, to rescind so much of the proceedings of Fri day, as were subsequent to the asking and obtaining leave to introduce the hill referred to, and this motion being successful, that part of the proceedings was resC;nded and the motion of MT. Wright was then referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. with nstruc- tions to prepare and report bill.

            "article": "Information vas received in London on the evening of November A. through the French papers, in which\n\n it said that Ibrahm hosted the white fag[see No. W of the official despatches before sunset the time prescribed by the Admras and if he did 1t would appear that he inclined submit at least for the moment. This news, if true, is likewise important though it is not impossible it is nevertheless very doubtful. The most authentic uH-ofhcial accounts, state that Ibrahm not at Navarn at the time of the battle having been engaged for fortnight in the interior of the Morea, pursuing the Christians Tn the mountains of Messenla, attending the execution of some priests, whom he had crucIfied on some olive trees, making hoocauss of poor peasantry, pack ages of young girls and infants, send into Egypt, and laying the country waste by fire and sword root\n\n ing up the olives, vines, 6g-trees, &c. &c.\n\n The Editor of the Morning Herald apprehends that his conduct would be regulated by the of his store. If his provisions short it would be that he could have other alternative than pend hostilties precpate the total destruction of his troops by famine. II, however, statement in the French papers, protesting to be founded on letters from Zante, dated Oct. 25th may be relied on, the hoistng of the white flag by the Egyptian command CT is out of question. According to this sateme mt, Ibrahim Pacha, on being informed of the memora- be events of the Both, had retreated to Coron and had caused all the Greek prisoners, men, women, & children, who had been in his power for the last l5 months, to be put to death by the sword According to the priests aud other persons devoted to !igion, were crucfed, or burnt by slow fire. The de aIis given on ths subject make one shudder but every thing that the last hour of the Egyp tan tyger approaches. The English, French and R ssian flags, have been flying the walls of Maya rlno since the 24th. ModeD must now be in the pow CT of the Triple Alliance The Herald adds, how ever, that the above intelligence appears to of a doubtful character. If it be true it is quite clear l.\n\n brahm, determined not to surrender, and we do not see how the sangunary monster can be drven out of the Morea, without troops are employed against him. Indeed, it is said that troops will be mlnedi- atey forwarded the iIorea from Gibraltar and the British possessions in the Mediterranean. Private letters from Paris also state that the minister of ma rne had issued orders for the fitting out of several l ships of the line for the Mediterranean\"\n\n But the good news does not stop here. Mir. Ey- nard, the Chairman of the Greek Committee of Swift zerand, writes from Beaulieu Nov. 8, that he has re- ceived official confirmation ofthe account of the Greek fleet having burnt in the Gulf of Iepanto six Turkish brigs, and taken three Austrian transports.\n\n The Morning Herald of Nov. l5, announces the ar- rival of Mir. Lindsay, with despaches from Vienna, and of lord Ingesrie from Navarino Mir. l.. left Vi- enna on the 9th November The news of the battle of Navarino had reached that city the day before. Previous to Mir. Linsey's departure, the British Am bassador had an interview with Prince Metternch : the result of which interview Mir. l.. has of brought with him. It is understood that the Austrian Cabinet approves--or rather does not complan--o! the destruction of the Austrian transports engaged in the service of the Pacha of Egypt. With respect 10 ,he adyices which Mir. Lindsay brings r. lave the Porte, it is understood that more pacific disposition 1 has begun manifest itself in the Dvan. Al the date, however, of the advices, it should be remem-\n\n bered that the Porte ignorant of the destruction of the Egyptian fleet. What effect this event will\n\n have on the councils of the Sutan and apon the pas\n\n sions of the Turks remain to be seen.\n\n The Constitutionnel says \"the destruction of the fleet by the Allied powers must be serious that the\n\n shrewdest and penetrating mind cannot calculate ] on it's consequences. There can be no temerlty in\n\n anticipating real against Turkey, and the de-\n\n structon of that barbarous empre which has been so\n\n ong wished for by the sincere and enghned friends l of humanity, who wish for the independence and \\ dignity If iu1i IduaIs and natons.p H'Ihe news\n\n says the paper another place must fall like\n\n thunderbolt upon the Dyan-and particularly upon ! the Grand Segnor; and have we no reason to teaI\n\n that in the first of his fury, he may not sci\n\n bounds to his vengeance aud cruelty Precautions il ! is said are taken in favor of those Europeans who\n\n are Tn the capital of the Ottoman empire; but what\n\n precautions can resist the wrath of despot by whose\n\n nod thousands of heads leap frO the'r shoulders Or",

The bill had been introduced with leave of the House, and was read twice and committed to the Committee on the Judiciary. and was so entered on the Journal. This entry was al- legged tO be the entry of a proceeding contra \" to the rules of the House. which require that bills thus introduced by the courtesy of the House, should be sent tO a committee to be prepared, before they could be subjected to legislative action. It was moved by Mir. Taylor to amend the Journal but the mo- ton was negatived by vote of IO1 to 68. A subsequent motion was made hy MT. Taylor, to rescind so much of the proceedings of Fri day, as were subsequent to the asking and obtaining leave to introduce the hill referred to, and this motion being successful, that part of the proceedings was resC;nded and the motion of MT. Wright was then referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. with nstruc- tions to prepare and report bill. Several private bills were reported, read and com mItted; and great number of petitions and resolutions were received. A communication was received from the Postmaster Gen\"ral.in reply t0 resolution,on the subject ofthe ob- .structions on the Mail Road between Match ez and New Orleans.\n\n \"Wednesday, Dec. 19.\n\n In :he Senate, yesterday, Mr. Robbins in troduced bill providing for the adjustment Of controversies arising between the State & the United States, which was read and pas scd to second reading. The bill for dstrib- uting among. the several states portion of the revenues of the United States was referred to select committee of seven. Select com mittees were also raised upon the claims of the surviving warriors off the revolution, upon French spolations, and upon the resolution for the revisal and arrangement of the rules of the Senate. The bill authorizing the State OfTenncssee to sell the lands. heretofore ap- propsiated to the use of Schools, was ordered 10 be engrossed for third reading.\n\n In the House Ofrepresentatiyes, Mir Mitch ell, of Tennessee, offered resolution relative to the removal of the Indians to the West of the Mississsippi,and placing them under ter ritorial government. Several bills were re- ported, and several petitions reported unfav- orably. Among the bills reported was one from the Select Committee on that subject, to authorize the occupation ofthe mouth of the Oregon river. bill was also reported by Mir Strong. allowing the Spanish inhabitants of Florida, who were residents when the ter ritory was transferred to this country, in 1924 the right of voting in any elections of Legis- latlve Council Delegate of Congress, or any other officer. This bill was ordered to be en- crossed, and read third time to-day.\n\n Thursday.

The bill for abolishing Imprisonment for debt was taken mp, in Committee the whole, ,and was advocated in a long speech by MT Johnson of Ky.\n\n In the House of Representatives, bill was reported from the committee on public lands granting relief to purchasers of Public Lands which had reverted in consequence of the non-payment of the purchase money. Some discussion took place on the proposition offer on Tuesday, by MT. Bartlett to amend the 85th Rule of the House so as to preclude the introduction of bill, except by Report of the Committee. After some discussion the bill was laid on the tahe. This discus sion arose out of the erroneous discussion of the Speaker on Friday last. by which bill in troduced by Mr Wright of Ohio, with leave of the House, was suffered to be read twice and committed, without having been first sent to Committee to be prepared, according to the 85th Rule. It will be recollected that on motion of MT. Taylor,the House subsequent ly resclnded the proceeding.

            "article": "\n\n Presidents Message, is the omission press upon the attention of Congress the Tariff question: and urge it to a cordial support ofthe American System\" With the utmost proprety this subject left to the discre ton of the Secretary of the Treasury. whose report is principally inserted in paper this day. As sthe dutyof this officer, exclusively, to watch the f. nacial of the country, propose the best constitutional measures for increasing the revenue and to recommend any alteration in the present of income the Treasury, as he is the only Head of Department who is required to make to Congress an annual expose of the of the concerns under his charge, it is really his duty and only his, mend to Congress a revision of the Tariff, whether to increase decrease the present rate of duties. This he has done, in very able and lucId manner and we should suppose the entire satisfaction of even Messrs Wells and Woodward, unless they are like Monsieur Wronghead, who, on entering his house, inquired of his wife, with upon her head, why she had not fed thespgshnd upon being answered hatshe had fed them, he repled-yes I'll it, for you cternaly interfering with that winch does you. First, Mr. Wells comes out with long whining paragraph, complaining that the President is inter- ierng with questions entirely without the constitution al limits by which he should be guarded. In few\n\n \n\n bnnkrupsy and ruin, because the President leaves to other constituted authority attention to cer- tain which do not pro perly belong to himself These supposed stretches of power and negects of duty portrayed in lively colors by Mir. Wells, and his heart to swell with all the anxiety of vete- patriot in view the degradation and ruin of his country. Has it, however, heretofore happened that young man, lacking some years of thirty with no more than common knowledge of men and things, has been able to convince an intelligent community that he is better acquainted with all the ramifcations of national government, than old and able n,who filled high offices with hononr themselves and their constituents long before he had being ?- Can he make them believe that when he censures, there is for censurethat his approval of men and measures is proof positive of their excellence will his ceaseless attempts at showing his very superb or knowledge of affairs only tend excite pity for his weakness and disgust for his oficiousness =? As for MT. Woodward, he has not the appear of honesty, eandor, and intelligence, which to superficial reader characterizes his brother Wells ]; but with his accustomed rashness in political matters, he rattles away hap-hazard whatever uppermost in his mind, without expressing desire to throw his bold assertions the mantle of truth and dor. What he says he says with vengeance, and leaves it for loggerheads decide upon the import which is attached to his articles; for even the editor himself is not dolt enough suppose that of sense will be iufuencedby his wild theories.\n\n {\" Lost Chaa.'-Near the close of the day Mon day, l7th inst. William Darling Iritchard, lovely sprighty child, aged years of Mr. Darling Pritchard of Milton Society, left home in search of his father whom he thought to find at the forge. He told by the workmen that his father had gone into the woods, whether the thoughtess wanderer, it aE rewards appeared, turned his steps. All the feelings of parents heart awakened when Mr. P. re- turned to his house, and to the anxious enquiries of the mother for her lovely boy he learnt that his had heedessy strayed away in search of him. Enquiries were made at the forge, and the father could only learn that his child astseen tho bridge. search immediately commenced; but as it conjec- tured that he have fallen into the the neigh bors penetrated but little way into the woods. The mill pond drawn off, and the neighbours commenced raking the waters for the body, which labor continued until Thursday. The search then extended into the woods, where, in a short tme, under cluster of bushes the lfeless and fro- body of the little sufferer was found. It appear cd that on the Monday evening proceeding, some in- dviduals engaged in the search. had gone within a. bout twenty rods of the spot where the child lay but from mistaken notion that he had fallen from the bridge, the undivided attention of the people was turned to searching for the body in the river. The child had gone but little distance into the wood, when he was probably overcome by seer occasioned by chill and crawed under bush, when three days afterwards his body was found.\n\n The democratic nerves ofour brother of the'' Re- gister appear to have been considerably agitated at the notice, in last, of Hon, Moves Barber and as- that this fout,\" to his elegant dicton, which we uttered against the hon. member, was be- cause he is gentleman and old school repubIi- can.''
