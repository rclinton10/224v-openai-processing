It stood sufficiently distant from the village to lose all its hustle, but was near enough to par ticipate in all its convenienees. A little bye path led past its door to the parish church :; and on the Sabbath the villagers would pause on their way, to admire the neatness of the dwelling, or to inhale the fragrance of the sweet flowers that blossomed with every sea- son, in the weIl-cuItivated and well-weeded garden, or to greet the neighbor as he went forth to worship, with his wife and his five children-so many models of what an Eng fish yeoman and his family should be.\n\n The cottage had been in the possession of James Morland and his ancestors for upwards of a century. They never hadheld higher, but never lower station than that of small farmers; and their means had always been equal to their necessities, or their wishes.- James, father, however, though an honest, was not a frugal man; he had lost his partner early in life, and he had neglected his oppor- tunities OfprOviding against \"rainy season\" When he died l\n\n \"And bequeathedto to his son good name,''- he left him scarcely any other inheritance.\n\n James had married well-aUeN in the only sense in which the word can be applied to marriage.

Religion always brings contentment, and without contentment there is no happiness. Its effects were manifest, not only in their own characters and conduct, and in the dispositions and habits of their own family, but in their domestic arrangements, and in their attention to those comforts and hum, hlo olorapcias 1uh;ch ,,,oAu fh oiw hor,o nc attractive as it was substantially valuable.- James had never any temptation to leave it, because he could no where have found so much enjoyment as in his own house; where his cheerful Mary and smiling little ones, re- cOmpensed his labor when done, or lighted, by their influence, his daily toll.\n\n The ways of Providence are often most mysterious; but to the eye of faith, there is always some convincing evidence, that when the virtuous are afflicted, their trials are sent to prove, and not to crush that their strength may be seen in trouble, and that their excel lencein diversity, may be like the perfume of bruised fowers-mOre powerful in its effects. and more extensively useful. Mary Morland had given birth to sixth child; but her se- were and dangerous illness had for several weeks prevented her husband from attending to his work. She had scarcely recovered, when their COW died, and two of their sheep were stolen. These misfortunes obliged James for the first time in his life, to be in arrears with his rent. He hoped. however to be req dy with it after harvest; but in consequence of his wife's confinement, his crop was very late, and the wet season had cOmmepced be- fore it was gathered in. Other difficulties came upon him, and he saw no possibility of discharging the debt, for which his landlords agent, a cold-hearted man, had become very pressing. James was too upright in principle to promise payment within short period: for he knew that many prosperous months alone could enable him to recover the ground he had lost. A distress was therefore levied on his house and land and James Morland and his family were driven from the ancient dwelling of their for-fathers, with no other possession than their honest hearts, and a humble de- pendence on Him, whom they knew clothed the fair flowers of the beautiful garden, and provided homes for the little chirping spar rows that nestled in the thatch of the cottage from which they were exiled.\n\n The whole family had passed the threshold, and had fingered for some minutes in the gar den. The wife had given her infant to the care of her eldest boy ,and was gazing through the half-Open lattice, into the late cheerful and happy parlour. The tears had gathered in her eyes, as she trained up and fastened a branch of the honeysuckle that had given way, and then plucked one of its many blos- soms, on which she looked earnestly. as if bidding farewell to the beautiful tree she had so long watched and cherished. The mourn ful group of children gathered round her, and endeavored to attract her attention by asking questions as to which of their flowers they should carry with them. The poor afflicted mother turned around,-she could contain herself no longer; but clasping each by turn to her bosom, she wept bitterly as she bade \"God bless them.\" The husband, full of hustle and apparent carelessness, had entered his cottage, to see that nothing had been left behind; but when he returned, it was evident that it's bare walls and desolare appearance had weighed heavily upon him. He looked on his wife, suppressed heart-sob, and ex- claimed, \"Come, my Mary, take up your child, and God will guide us to some other resting place.\" The family passed through the little gate of their garden, again turned to gaze on their once happy home, and went their way.\n\n Their dog had been spectator of the scene, and he seemed perfectly conscious of the sor- row that had fallen on his masters house, as he ran from one member of it to another. .whi- ned and wagged his tail, to each, and then lay down in farther part of the garden, gazing wistfuy on the group.

Thus, the hope of heav- en, if that hope was dream, smooths her passage to the tomb, and renders religion essential to her happiness.\n\n Ingenuity of the Be00er in cOmtenement M. Godfrey de St. Hilaire relates the following fact \"A few years since there was in the royal menagerie, in the Jardin des PlanteS, in Paris, beaver belonging to the family of the Rhone beavers, which live solitary like the water rats. The ob- servations on this animal which had oc- casion to make, placed it beyond doubt, that this variety of the beaver species can, upon emergency, exert their instinctive sa- gacity, as resource upon unforeseen diffi- culties and mishaps. As protection from the rather severe cold of winter, our bea- yer was furnished with nothing but more abundant supply of straw. The nights grew colder; and the falling door of his cage had so many chinks, that the animal was forced to set about preparing better defence against the inclemency of the wea ther. It was usual to give him, as we'll for food as for employment in the night, { quantity of green boughs, the bark ofwhich was always found gnawed off in the morn ing; and every evening, regularly, before his door was closed, he received a certain 1 allowance of other articles of food, consist ing of fruit and garden vegetables. On one occasion, after it had been showing all day, a good deal of snow had accumulated in the corner of his cage. Such were the mate- rials which the beaver had at his disposal, and which he diverted from their proper destination, to employ them in the forma- ton of a wall, which should defend him from the external air and cold. With the boughs he interlaced the bars of his cage, with as much regularity as is displayed in the work of a basket-maker. The plated branches, however, were not so close as not to leave open spaces, for filling which, the animal had recourse to his other supp plies. For this purpose he employed the turnips, apples, and straw and the former was gnawed or cut into pieces, suitable to the vacancies. Lastly, as though the ani- nal was sensible that he needed still clo- ser shelter, he used the snow to plaster the whole, and then filled all the little remain ing interstices. The wall covered two- thirds of the aperture of the door. and all the provisions with which the beaver had this time been supplied were expended in it's construction. The next morning, the door of the cage was found by the keeper frozen fast by the snow to the new wall.- It was not without some trouble that it could be detached and opened, and then the contrivance of the inhabitant was expo sed to view. The man was so astonished that he left it untouched, and called me to look at it. From the Albion.\n\n An anomalous form of speech has lately crept into our language, which, though it sets at defiance all rules of syntax, and all sound principles of criticism, has still spread itself, by soft of epidemic power, through a great part of our country and has even found advocates among those who would be thought the literat of the land. allude to a strange confusion of singular and plu. : ral, in mentioning several persons of the f same name: as The Messrs.

The fashionable world, tho they are not usually quoted as authority or questions of philology, are, however, SUI. preme law-givers, as to the mode of ad- dressing a card {: and their decree is, that in addressing two ladies of the same name, you must not speak grammatically.

Thus you may say, The Misses Brown\" or |\" The Miss Browns\" but by no means be so vulgar as to make the address correct through. out.\n\n The writers in the public prints, who at- tempt to vindicate this barbarism, tell us that if one of the words is in the plural num- ber, that is sufficient to show that more than one person is intended; and that putting the other in the same number is, at best altogether useless; and perhaps some o them fear that two plurals, like two nega- tives, may neutralize each other.\n\n The concord, which it is thought neces. sary, in all other cases, to preserve between f the different members of sentence, is here uneeremoniously rejected, without leave",

A school-boy\n\n who should write DOnsini Cato or Domi-\n\n 1uS CGtOnes, would probably be fogged for blockhead.\n\n 1t has been claimed by some, that the phrase :\" The Miss Browns\" is a compound noun and that there is no more propriety in saying \" The Misses Browns\" than in saying \"the golds-watches,\" or \"the el- bows-chairs,\" or !\" the rails-fences\" How this plan of melting down several young la-\n\n dies, by kind of pathological chemistry,\n\n into one noun-subStantive, would please the ladies themselves, shall not now inquire.\n\n But would appeal to the common sense of every reader of English, and beg him, in mere charity, to expound to me what pos sible analogy there is between the two ex- amples. In the legitimate compound noun, the first member of the word is mere adjective, qualifying or describing 1 the substantive which follows. Thus a 1 gold watch is watch of gold; an elbow chair, is chair with elbows; rail fence, is a fence of rails. Now what is Miss Brown? Is she Brown of Miss or can some other definition be given of her trust it needs no argument to show that the\n\n two cases are wholly dissimilar. Miss\n\n Brown may be assured that she is not\n\n compound noun and if she is not so, it ! IXUiI hO fn off fn Eo If hnr self and sisters jointly.\n\n 1 But there is another class of critics, who reject this doctrine of the compound noun, as wholly absurd aud come round us by most ingenious theory, to demonstrate that the most natural perphrasis in the world will reconcile all the rules of syntax, & avoid the \" double plural,\" (of which they have great horror,) in the peculiarly graceful phrase-\"The Misses Brown!\" Just \"com-\n\n plete the square\" as a mathematician might say,-and you hear The misses, each of\n\n whose names is Brown;\" as correct, simple\n\n and beautiful form of address as one\n\n would wish to see. This theory is the\n\n more to be admired, as it will redeem, from\n\n the charge of illegitimacy, many an unlucky\n\n form of speech. whose paternity woRld otth-\n\n erwise be matter of great doubt. Take for\n\n example :\" the two Brown\" Now many\n\n rash critic might pronounce this an outra- geous violation of all rules, and all propriety of speech. But mark how all shadow of\n\n suspicion shall vanish before the illumina-\n\n ting influence of this admirable theory! |\" The two, each of whose names is Brown\" There you have it as plain as the nose on your face. Thus, you see, any enormity\n\n in the abuse of the Kings English may be\n\n explained, away, as easily as by the fo0r-\n\n ish of conjuror's wand.\n\n But, after all, as I am not ambitious of\n\n much literary display, shall content my\n\n self with paying my respects to !\" The Mis-\n\n ses Browns\" in plain, old fashioned ENGLISH. } Parties which huve c1isted, and chich do nOw e1ist in this C0untry.-Concluded, - Tho second candidate was spoken of by e those who knew him, as possessing good talents, gentlemanly manners, with an in- s dependent spirit.

In a climate variable as ours where the changes of the weather are frequently sudden and unexpected, it requires more care and attention to guard against this dangerous enemy of life, than most people imagine, or are able and willing to bestow.

It hsals the injured parts. opens the pores and com poses the disturbed nerves, after the manner of an annodyne; consequently the obstruc- ton of the chest and the lungs which consti- tute the disease, particularly need its use. It promotes approximation, which is constantly called for; and whilst it cleanses and heals it also gives strength to the tender lungs. In this manner 1t removes the hectic fever, improves digestion, gives strength to the nerves, repairs the appetite and improves the spirits.

It stood sufficiently distant from the village to lose all its hustle, but was near enough to par ticipate in all its convenienees. A little bye path led past its door to the parish church :; and on the Sabbath the villagers would pause on their way, to admire the neatness of the dwelling, or to inhale the fragrance of the sweet flowers that blossomed with every sea- son, in the weIl-cuItivated and well-weeded garden, or to greet the neighbor as he went forth to worship, with his wife and his five children-so many models of what an Eng fish yeoman and his family should be.\n\n The cottage had been in the possession of James Morland and his ancestors for upwards of a century. They never hadheld higher, but never lower station than that of small farmers; and their means had always been equal to their necessities, or their wishes.- James, father, however, though an honest, was not a frugal man; he had lost his partner early in life, and he had neglected his oppor- tunities OfprOviding against \"rainy season\" When he died l\n\n \"And bequeathedto to his son good name,''- he left him scarcely any other inheritance.\n\n James had married well-aUeN in the only sense in which the word can be applied to marriage. His wife was one who felt and en- joyed the blessings of religion, and his chil- dren were brought up in the nurture and ad- monition the Lord. Religion always brings contentment, and without contentment there is no happiness. Its effects were manifest, not only in their own characters and conduct, and in the dispositions and habits of their own family, but in their domestic arrangements, and in their attention to those comforts and hum, hlo olorapcias 1uh;ch ,,,oAu fh oiw hor,o nc attractive as it was substantially valuable.- James had never any temptation to leave it, because he could no where have found so much enjoyment as in his own house; where his cheerful Mary and smiling little ones, re- cOmpensed his labor when done, or lighted, by their influence, his daily toll.\n\n The ways of Providence are often most mysterious; but to the eye of faith, there is always some convincing evidence, that when the virtuous are afflicted, their trials are sent to prove, and not to crush that their strength may be seen in trouble, and that their excel lencein diversity, may be like the perfume of bruised fowers-mOre powerful in its effects. and more extensively useful. Mary Morland had given birth to sixth child; but her se- were and dangerous illness had for several weeks prevented her husband from attending to his work. She had scarcely recovered, when their COW died, and two of their sheep were stolen. These misfortunes obliged James for the first time in his life, to be in arrears with his rent. He hoped. however to be req dy with it after harvest; but in consequence of his wife's confinement, his crop was very late, and the wet season had cOmmepced be- fore it was gathered in. Other difficulties came upon him, and he saw no possibility of discharging the debt, for which his landlords agent, a cold-hearted man, had become very pressing. James was too upright in principle to promise payment within short period: for he knew that many prosperous months alone could enable him to recover the ground he had lost. A distress was therefore levied on his house and land and James Morland and his family were driven from the ancient dwelling of their for-fathers, with no other possession than their honest hearts, and a humble de- pendence on Him, whom they knew clothed the fair flowers of the beautiful garden, and provided homes for the little chirping spar rows that nestled in the thatch of the cottage from which they were exiled.\n\n The whole family had passed the threshold, and had fingered for some minutes in the gar den. The wife had given her infant to the care of her eldest boy ,and was gazing through the half-Open lattice, into the late cheerful and happy parlour. The tears had gathered in her eyes, as she trained up and fastened a branch of the honeysuckle that had given way, and then plucked one of its many blos- soms, on which she looked earnestly. as if bidding farewell to the beautiful tree she had so long watched and cherished. The mourn ful group of children gathered round her, and endeavored to attract her attention by asking questions as to which of their flowers they should carry with them. The poor afflicted mother turned around,-she could contain herself no longer; but clasping each by turn to her bosom, she wept bitterly as she bade \"God bless them.\" The husband, full of hustle and apparent carelessness, had entered his cottage, to see that nothing had been left behind; but when he returned, it was evident that it's bare walls and desolare appearance had weighed heavily upon him. He looked on his wife, suppressed heart-sob, and ex- claimed, \"Come, my Mary, take up your child, and God will guide us to some other resting place.\" The family passed through the little gate of their garden, again turned to gaze on their once happy home, and went their way.\n\n Their dog had been spectator of the scene, and he seemed perfectly conscious of the sor- row that had fallen on his masters house, as he ran from one member of it to another. .whi- ned and wagged his tail, to each, and then lay down in farther part of the garden, gazing wistfuy on the group.

Thus, the hope of heav- en, if that hope was dream, smooths her passage to the tomb, and renders religion essential to her happiness.\n\n Ingenuity of the Be00er in cOmtenement M. Godfrey de St. Hilaire relates the following fact \"A few years since there was in the royal menagerie, in the Jardin des PlanteS, in Paris, beaver belonging to the family of the Rhone beavers, which live solitary like the water rats. The ob- servations on this animal which had oc- casion to make, placed it beyond doubt, that this variety of the beaver species can, upon emergency, exert their instinctive sa- gacity, as resource upon unforeseen diffi- culties and mishaps. As protection from the rather severe cold of winter, our bea- yer was furnished with nothing but more abundant supply of straw. The nights grew colder; and the falling door of his cage had so many chinks, that the animal was forced to set about preparing better defence against the inclemency of the wea ther. It was usual to give him, as we'll for food as for employment in the night, { quantity of green boughs, the bark ofwhich was always found gnawed off in the morn ing; and every evening, regularly, before his door was closed, he received a certain 1 allowance of other articles of food, consist ing of fruit and garden vegetables. On one occasion, after it had been showing all day, a good deal of snow had accumulated in the corner of his cage. Such were the mate- rials which the beaver had at his disposal, and which he diverted from their proper destination, to employ them in the forma- ton of a wall, which should defend him from the external air and cold. With the boughs he interlaced the bars of his cage, with as much regularity as is displayed in the work of a basket-maker. The plated branches, however, were not so close as not to leave open spaces, for filling which, the animal had recourse to his other supp plies. For this purpose he employed the turnips, apples, and straw and the former was gnawed or cut into pieces, suitable to the vacancies. Lastly, as though the ani- nal was sensible that he needed still clo- ser shelter, he used the snow to plaster the whole, and then filled all the little remain ing interstices. The wall covered two- thirds of the aperture of the door. and all the provisions with which the beaver had this time been supplied were expended in it's construction. The next morning, the door of the cage was found by the keeper frozen fast by the snow to the new wall.- It was not without some trouble that it could be detached and opened, and then the contrivance of the inhabitant was expo sed to view. The man was so astonished that he left it untouched, and called me to look at it. From the Albion.\n\n An anomalous form of speech has lately crept into our language, which, though it sets at defiance all rules of syntax, and all sound principles of criticism, has still spread itself, by soft of epidemic power, through a great part of our country and has even found advocates among those who would be thought the literat of the land. allude to a strange confusion of singular and plu. : ral, in mentioning several persons of the f same name: as The Messrs. Brown''- - ne WIT. DrOWDS ~ OG MISSc\n\n Brown,\" &c. The fashionable world, tho they are not usually quoted as authority or questions of philology, are, however, SUI. preme law-givers, as to the mode of ad- dressing a card {: and their decree is, that in addressing two ladies of the same name, you must not speak grammatically. They kindly give you leave to choose which ot the words you will write correctly; but the rule is absolute that there must be viola ton ofsyntax somewhere. Thus you may say, The Misses Brown\" or |\" The Miss Browns\" but by no means be so vulgar as to make the address correct through. out.\n\n The writers in the public prints, who at- tempt to vindicate this barbarism, tell us that if one of the words is in the plural num- ber, that is sufficient to show that more than one person is intended; and that putting the other in the same number is, at best altogether useless; and perhaps some o them fear that two plurals, like two nega- tives, may neutralize each other.\n\n The concord, which it is thought neces. sary, in all other cases, to preserve between f the different members of sentence, is here uneeremoniously rejected, without leave",

A school-boy\n\n who should write DOnsini Cato or Domi-\n\n 1uS CGtOnes, would probably be fogged for blockhead.\n\n 1t has been claimed by some, that the phrase :\" The Miss Browns\" is a compound noun and that there is no more propriety in saying \" The Misses Browns\" than in saying \"the golds-watches,\" or \"the el- bows-chairs,\" or !\" the rails-fences\" How this plan of melting down several young la-\n\n dies, by kind of pathological chemistry,\n\n into one noun-subStantive, would please the ladies themselves, shall not now inquire.\n\n But would appeal to the common sense of every reader of English, and beg him, in mere charity, to expound to me what pos sible analogy there is between the two ex- amples. In the legitimate compound noun, the first member of the word is mere adjective, qualifying or describing 1 the substantive which follows. Thus a 1 gold watch is watch of gold; an elbow chair, is chair with elbows; rail fence, is a fence of rails. Now what is Miss Brown? Is she Brown of Miss or can some other definition be given of her trust it needs no argument to show that the\n\n two cases are wholly dissimilar.

This theory is the\n\n more to be admired, as it will redeem, from\n\n the charge of illegitimacy, many an unlucky\n\n form of speech. whose paternity woRld otth-\n\n erwise be matter of great doubt. Take for\n\n example :\" the two Brown\" Now many\n\n rash critic might pronounce this an outra- geous violation of all rules, and all propriety of speech. But mark how all shadow of\n\n suspicion shall vanish before the illumina-\n\n ting influence of this admirable theory! |\" The two, each of whose names is Brown\" There you have it as plain as the nose on your face. Thus, you see, any enormity\n\n in the abuse of the Kings English may be\n\n explained, away, as easily as by the fo0r-\n\n ish of conjuror's wand.\n\n But, after all, as I am not ambitious of\n\n much literary display, shall content my\n\n self with paying my respects to !\" The Mis-\n\n ses Browns\" in plain, old fashioned ENGLISH. } Parties which huve c1isted, and chich do nOw e1ist in this C0untry.-Concluded, - Tho second candidate was spoken of by e those who knew him, as possessing good talents, gentlemanly manners, with an in- s dependent spirit.
