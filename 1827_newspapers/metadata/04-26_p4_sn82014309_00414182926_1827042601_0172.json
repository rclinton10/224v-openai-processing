The news soon spread through the town, and excited very different feelings. A con- siderable number were pleased. A time was soon appointed to meet and bleed the Bull and taste his Blood, as it was then termed. Not so with Uncle Thomas, Up- on hearing the news, and seeing how the people were affected. he fetched deep sigh and exclaimed, # tt has come to this, ve ure an undone people :! |! But strange ,as it may seem at the present day, this barrel of rum lasted a full year.\n\n My Uncle Thomas lived to be above %, and it is about , years since his death. Whether the old gentleman was endued with spirit of prophecy, I will not say but verily believe that if the fathers of New -Englaud, who were on the stage Go or 100 years ago, could have looked for ward to the present time and been assur- ed that the quantity of ardent spirits would now have been expended that actually is, and of all the pernicious consequences att tending the same, emulttudes would with uncle Thomas have exclaimed, Ne,o- Eng- land is an undone People! Could the ac- tuai expense for ardent spirits needleslv used, be accurately ascertained, it is be- lieved the sum would, in many of our towns amount to more than which is expended for taxes and for charitable purposes ofev- cry description. This, to many .mav seem incredible but if in one of our towns. which in public estimation stands pretty high in a moral point of view, ninety hops- heads of new Rum are annually sold a,monp a population of less than fifteen houndred souls, who will doubt that the whole a. mount for ardent spirits more than is need- inl, exceeds sum greater than is expended m such towns for taxes and for charity ? And what is the use !? Are we wiser than were our fathers 2 Are we more healthy [ Are we longer-lived generally? Is not the tact otherwise? It is true the conseouence oi the temperance, the industry, the vir- 'ue' and the patriotism of our venerable ancestors. our, situation and our prospects are'or might be, vastly preferable to theirs,\n\n nu! what would probably have been our sit- uauon al me presentlmoment, had our pro- gen!.ofs. instead of practising their regular haDits' 1ndu'ged in intemperencesa and aD- nually expended ninety hogshead of Ne,, Rum for every Jtesn Hundred inhab;tan,s, And alas what is to be the consoquencs as it respects our posterity, unless we re. form and leave them better examnle.",

            "raw_text": "\n\n In speaking, on a former occasion, ot the remedy for intemperance proposed by pr. Chambers of this city, we expressed our selves win ia considerablede degree ofcaution. As it is subject of greatYimportance 10 the community, and one on whicllthey ought to be explicitly and accurately infoi imed, we have within the past week spent more than one whole day in mikng personal lnves- tigation into cases where the remedy has been applied, and intothe nature of themed- icine, inthe hope of eQniIle to full and satisfactory conclusion. Tine result of our enquiries will be seen in tue scauel. The remedy is not the same with that pro posed by Mr. -Loiseau of N. Orleans; pr ii it is, the coincidence is unknown to Dr. c. They have had no manner of intercourse on the subject, and are entire strangers to each other. Dr. c. has been in possession of the secret, in its essential principles, for number ofyearS. A\n\n The medicine is taken in liquor:-that of which the patient is most fond, usually pre- ferred. It is not unpleasant to the taste as we have ascertained from those who have takeni it, and still more accurately from hav- ing tasted it ourselves. ~..\n\n In its operation tits powerful, but not dan gerous. It usually operates as a cathartic, and also as an emetic; but not always in both respects. In all cases nausea is produ- ced.\n\n There are three notifications of the medicine adapted to the peculiar habits of the parties andthe inveteracy of the dis ease. Of courseit is important, in making application for persons at a distance, to state these particulars as definitely as pos sible. In the mildest, we are told by pr. C. that it fails ofcuring in about four cases out oftwenty. Resort is then had to the other notifications. r s.a ,r\n\n In almost every instance, more than one dose is necessary. The greatest number of doses which have been taken in any case which we have examined, is seven or eight. The cure is generally complete ill the course of a single week.\n\n Before being mingled with the liquor in which lis to be taken, the medicine sub Sists in two forms--as. a2liquid, and as powder. The former is of a red color, the latter of light brown. In this formi it can be forwarded through the Post Office, in letters containing the proper directions.\n\n Dr. c. has had the generosity to offer it to the poor of this city who are unable to make any compensation gratis. To oth- CTS the price is not extravagant considering the nature ofthe remedy, and is varied in some measure according to the circumstan- ces of the individual.\n\n It has already been applied ina large number of cases; in only two of which, as far as is known to Dr. c. has it failed of effecting a cure, unless prematurely relin- quished.\n\n We have conversed with two respectable gentlemen, entirely disinterested, who have had opportunity to witness the effects on a large number of individuals, and it is their decided opinion that it is real remedy.\n\n Several persons of good Standing in so- ciety, and who had been supposed to be perfectly temperate, have availed them- selves of the medicine. Some of them are known tobe cured, and others have never reported their cases to Dr. c. In general he is ignorant of their names, and, as is proper observes entire secrecy where it is other wise. We however learned from another person, that one of the number was a vene- rable member of the Society'of Friends he stated that his principles cn oined the strict est temperance, but that he had unfortun- ately contracted a fondness for ardent spir- its. of which, if it was possible, he wished to be e@cured. He is now astemperate as his principles requirS; and that not by copstraint, but of choice.\n\n We called last week upon man about 40 years of age employed in distillery, who had taken the medicine or 8'weeks pre- vious. A short time before applying to Dr. C. he had been dismissed from his employ ment for intemperance.. Being asked whether he had .'drank any thing\" since he took the medicine, he answered \"No.\" He was asked whether he abstained on the principle of self-denial, or because he had lost his appetite for ardent spirits: he ra- piled, that he had no desire for such liquors He was asked if his appetite for food had increased she said, it had always been good. He was asked if he believed himself finally cured he said he had no doubt of it.\n\n A barber, about 30 years old, had been in habits of intempcrance for or 4 years. The last thing at night, and first in the morning, was RUM. When he found he had become drunkard, he was often temp- ted, to Ego and drown himself in the Hud- son: but was prevented by an unseen hand. He at length heard of Dr. C's Nremedv and v,,a J, .sc.

To a question on this point, he replied. stretching out his hand and arm with per- feet steadiness, \"see that ,\"\n\n But the most extraordinary cure which we met with, was that of Journeyma n printer. He had beon educated drunk ard. In his boyhood, his father, now in the grave by intemperance, used to lead him a. bout to taverns and \"porter-houses,\" and after drinking himself, 10 give of the same poison to his little son. Under these cir- cumstances it is not s1range,if at the age ot IT he was confirmed drunkard. He is now 30. In the course of these l3 years of de- baucherv, he has been twice lunatic--has been once carried to the hospital-has had two fits, and one convulsion-has been oft- en found dead drunk in the sreets,and car- ried home or to the watch-house,- ,-has l freouently lost his hat and shoes--has abus- l ed his mother-in short, has been drunk ard of the very worst character.

Peace is now restored to this disorganized family :>s and his widowed mother is rejoicing and blessing God for this. unexpected deliverancc.--We ought however, to add, that having taken the medicine in spirits, he is still fond of strong beer he is fully satisfied that by treating l this appetite in the same manner as the other, the result will be the same. He is\n\n determined to try the experiment.\n\n In making most of these inquiries, we\n\n were accompanied by the Rev. l..

The news soon spread through the town, and excited very different feelings. A con- siderable number were pleased. A time was soon appointed to meet and bleed the Bull and taste his Blood, as it was then termed. Not so with Uncle Thomas, Up- on hearing the news, and seeing how the people were affected. he fetched deep sigh and exclaimed, # tt has come to this, ve ure an undone people :! |! But strange ,as it may seem at the present day, this barrel of rum lasted a full year.\n\n My Uncle Thomas lived to be above %, and it is about , years since his death. Whether the old gentleman was endued with spirit of prophecy, I will not say but verily believe that if the fathers of New -Englaud, who were on the stage Go or 100 years ago, could have looked for ward to the present time and been assur- ed that the quantity of ardent spirits would now have been expended that actually is, and of all the pernicious consequences att tending the same, emulttudes would with uncle Thomas have exclaimed, Ne,o- Eng- land is an undone People! Could the ac- tuai expense for ardent spirits needleslv used, be accurately ascertained, it is be- lieved the sum would, in many of our towns amount to more than which is expended for taxes and for charitable purposes ofev- cry description.

            "article": "\n\n In speaking, on a former occasion, ot the remedy for intemperance proposed by pr. Chambers of this city, we expressed our selves win ia considerablede degree ofcaution. As it is subject of greatYimportance 10 the community, and one on whicllthey ought to be explicitly and accurately infoi imed, we have within the past week spent more than one whole day in mikng personal lnves- tigation into cases where the remedy has been applied, and intothe nature of themed- icine, inthe hope of eQniIle to full and satisfactory conclusion. Tine result of our enquiries will be seen in tue scauel. The remedy is not the same with that pro posed by Mr. -Loiseau of N. Orleans; pr ii it is, the coincidence is unknown to Dr. c. They have had no manner of intercourse on the subject, and are entire strangers to each other. Dr. c. has been in possession of the secret, in its essential principles, for number ofyearS. A\n\n The medicine is taken in liquor:-that of which the patient is most fond, usually pre- ferred. It is not unpleasant to the taste as we have ascertained from those who have takeni it, and still more accurately from hav- ing tasted it ourselves. ~..\n\n In its operation tits powerful, but not dan gerous. It usually operates as a cathartic, and also as an emetic; but not always in both respects. In all cases nausea is produ- ced.\n\n There are three notifications of the medicine adapted to the peculiar habits of the parties andthe inveteracy of the dis ease. Of courseit is important, in making application for persons at a distance, to state these particulars as definitely as pos sible. In the mildest, we are told by pr. C. that it fails ofcuring in about four cases out oftwenty. Resort is then had to the other notifications. r s.a ,r\n\n In almost every instance, more than one dose is necessary. The greatest number of doses which have been taken in any case which we have examined, is seven or eight. The cure is generally complete ill the course of a single week.\n\n Before being mingled with the liquor in which lis to be taken, the medicine sub Sists in two forms--as. a2liquid, and as powder. The former is of a red color, the latter of light brown. In this formi it can be forwarded through the Post Office, in letters containing the proper directions.\n\n Dr. c. has had the generosity to offer it to the poor of this city who are unable to make any compensation gratis. To oth- CTS the price is not extravagant considering the nature ofthe remedy, and is varied in some measure according to the circumstan- ces of the individual.\n\n It has already been applied ina large number of cases; in only two of which, as far as is known to Dr. c. has it failed of effecting a cure, unless prematurely relin- quished.\n\n We have conversed with two respectable gentlemen, entirely disinterested, who have had opportunity to witness the effects on a large number of individuals, and it is their decided opinion that it is real remedy.\n\n Several persons of good Standing in so- ciety, and who had been supposed to be perfectly temperate, have availed them- selves of the medicine. Some of them are known tobe cured, and others have never reported their cases to Dr. c. In general he is ignorant of their names, and, as is proper observes entire secrecy where it is other wise. We however learned from another person, that one of the number was a vene- rable member of the Society'of Friends he stated that his principles cn oined the strict est temperance, but that he had unfortun- ately contracted a fondness for ardent spir- its. of which, if it was possible, he wished to be e@cured. He is now astemperate as his principles requirS; and that not by copstraint, but of choice.\n\n We called last week upon man about 40 years of age employed in distillery, who had taken the medicine or 8'weeks pre- vious. A short time before applying to Dr. C. he had been dismissed from his employ ment for intemperance.. Being asked whether he had .'drank any thing\" since he took the medicine, he answered \"No.\" He was asked whether he abstained on the principle of self-denial, or because he had lost his appetite for ardent spirits: he ra- piled, that he had no desire for such liquors He was asked if his appetite for food had increased she said, it had always been good. He was asked if he believed himself finally cured he said he had no doubt of it.\n\n A barber, about 30 years old, had been in habits of intempcrance for or 4 years. The last thing at night, and first in the morning, was RUM. When he found he had become drunkard, he was often temp- ted, to Ego and drown himself in the Hud- son: but was prevented by an unseen hand. He at length heard of Dr. C's Nremedv and v,,a J, .sc.

He had beon educated drunk ard. In his boyhood, his father, now in the grave by intemperance, used to lead him a. bout to taverns and \"porter-houses,\" and after drinking himself, 10 give of the same poison to his little son. Under these cir- cumstances it is not s1range,if at the age ot IT he was confirmed drunkard. He is now 30. In the course of these l3 years of de- baucherv, he has been twice lunatic--has been once carried to the hospital-has had two fits, and one convulsion-has been oft- en found dead drunk in the sreets,and car- ried home or to the watch-house,- ,-has l freouently lost his hat and shoes--has abus- l ed his mother-in short, has been drunk ard of the very worst character. A quart of spirits day, was for him moderate portion. Hewould often get up nights, to slake his unsuitable appetite for rum. This man resorted to Dr. C. about weekssago took his medicine seven times-and has drank no ardent spirits since, nor had any desire for it. Peace is now restored to this disorganized family :>s and his widowed mother is rejoicing and blessing God for this. unexpected deliverancc.--We ought however, to add, that having taken the medicine in spirits, he is still fond of strong beer he is fully satisfied that by treating l this appetite in the same manner as the other, the result will be the same. He is\n\n determined to try the experiment.\n\n In making most of these inquiries, we\n\n were accompanied by the Rev. l..
