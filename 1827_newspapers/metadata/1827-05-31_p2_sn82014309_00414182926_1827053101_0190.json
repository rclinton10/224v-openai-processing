The great object is to give the Senate more strength and durability as at present constituted it is very fuctuating, the members are con- stantly changing-it is coordinate to be sure, but it ought to be also iudependant, so that they may check any sudden acts of this House, and not fear for their own safe- ty.-If the decision of particular Senator was not liked in his own District, his elec- ton might be dependant upon it; but it would not change the whole body-that time would be left for reflection and the cooling of passion, and the same Senators would be more likely to be returned again that steady member would have much more influence in the Senate, than mere passenger, who was expecting to be in that body but one year and consequently would not feel confidence in himself nor acquire influence over others. He said his object was to give the Senate more influence, ,bur if the amendme mt prevailed the evils of change would come upon us with more violence, and that party feeling excited, which was now dying away.\n\n MT. Shepard explained about majorities &c. The question, was then put upon the amendment and about 15 or 16 voted in favour of it.\n\n MT. Rider thought no bill ought to pass until it provided that the State should be districted by counties, he therefore moved an amendment to the 2d section to pro- vide districting by counties. He said that in 1925 bill passed by large vote allow ing 6 counties Senators each, ,and coun- ties 2 each. He thought it extraordinary if man weighing 300 pounds should bear more weight in the House than smaller one, and he thought there was no danger of the small counties trampling up- 1 on the larger ones\n\n MT. Boardman said that the bill alluded 1 to by the gentleman from Wilmington (Mr. Rider) was rejected last year by great majority. The Legislature have right to alter counties and if the amendment prevailed counties cannot be altered or greater inequality will be made; that it was desirable as far as practicable that the limits of counties should be preserved but it was better to make an amendment that would last forever, than one tha: would want to be changcd-if we amend the bill at all we ought to make an amendment that will meet the minds of the people.\n\n MT. s Raymond said the lines are nsw marked out and we know what to do; that the representation in the House was une- qual, and he noticed the inequality in that respect between the counties of Fairfield and Litchdeld. That the large States were frittering away their power by dis trictng for the choice of members of Con- gress, and he never should consent to dis trict the State for that purpose.\n\n MT. Warren said he thought they were getting the cart before the horse, that he used to be member of this house, and they then did not manage bushes as at present; inSfnoA If hoO tho had %I,o,, x,~a.o",

The rule of the House was dispensed with, and the bill read the second time.\n\n The bill in form, for an act in addition to an act relating to the concerns of the Eagle Bank, came to its third reading, and after some amendments, passed.\n\n Monday morning May 21.\n\n Bills for public acts, \" concerning fshe- ries\" \" for the support of paupers'' ' rela- ting to the assessment of taxes\" were sev- erally read the first time.\n\n On motion the rule of the house was dis pensed with, and the bill for public act, relating to the sale of spirituous liquors, was read a second time. The bill propo- ses an alteration of the penalty of selling without license from $50 to any sum be- tween $1O and $50, at the discretion of the court. MT. Shepard moved to amend the bill SO as to make the penalty $7 opposed by Messrs. Miner, Gurley and Boardman, and advocated by the mover, and lost; a discussion then ensued on the bill during which the House adjourned.\n\n Afternoon.\n\n Several bills for public acts, were read the first time: among them were, bills for the settlement of estates testate, intestate and insolvent; concerning crimes and pun ishments,; respecting the inspection of pro- visions; and relative to the collection of debts by foreign attachment.\n\n The resolution which had passed the house respecting the settlement of the boundary line between Connecticut and Massachusetts, came from the Senate amen- ded-on motion, the House considered and concurred.\n\n The bill for an act in alteration of an act regulating salaries and fees, was read the third time. The bill proposes to alter the compensation of Jurors to $1,34 pr day. A long debate ensued on the motion to re- duce the sum to $1,25, in which Messrs. Hill, Shepard, Gurley, Cooley, May, War ren, and others took part, and which was negatived and the bill passed. Adj'nd.\n\n Tuesday morning May 22.\n\n MT. Shepard moved to take up the Dis trict Bill-after the same had been read, he moved an amendment to the 2d Sect. providing that there should be as many Districts as Senators. He observed that the subject of districting the State had occupied the attention of our citizens, and was a subject of deep interest, that the principal heretofore had not been adopted in this State, and was truly republican measure, that it was calculated to bring home knowledge of the candidates for of- fee to the people, and their qualifications would be fairly canvassed and understood were the State divided into small districts, each Senator would be well acquainted with the wants of his immediate -constituents,- that the measure was loudly called for at present, and the amendment he believed to be generally agreeable to the members.\n\n MT. Warren observed that he thought the Committee ought to have the privilege to explain, that in his opinion the subject ought to be left to the Legislature in fu- ture to decide, and that he was against any provision of the kind in tho Bill that it was in his view more just to bring Sena- tor from each section of the State, but he was against any restriction, SO that every Legislature may adapt the law to the con- tiugencies of the times.\n\n MT. Boardman, said, he was disposed to give great latitude both as to the number of Senators, and the number of the districts-that a large majority of the House was in favor of districting, but the great difficulty would be found in going into detail, that he was disposed to give some latitude to the Legislature, rather than tie their hands-that the difficulties attending bill in detail were greater than any man would suppose who had not sat down and made calculations upon the sub- ject, that the section as reported allowed some discretion (from to districts) but the present amendment allowed none at all, except as to the number. of Senator's that some of tine committee were for leav- ing out all restrictions as to the number of Districts. fla division could now be made 1t would be unjust after census that he believed majority of the House did not wish to extend the number of districts be- yond the number of counties. It was thought by the committee, that the State might hereafter be Districted for the choice ofmembers of Congress, and they had pro- vided that the State should not be divided into less than five Districts, because our representation in Congress might be redu- ced to that number that it would proba- bly, be disastrous to the Bill, if they com-\n\n III 1A1 N",

Every member de- cIares himself in favor of districting bill, but 1 all are not friendly to the bill now before the house. The truth is, the people have de- inanded the passage of a~biIl for districting the state, and members dare not openly oppose the measure; but as they dread the effects of I districtng, some ofthem, who are aware that they can politically thrive only under the gen eral ticket system, seem desirous of destroy ing the present bill, under the pretext that its principles are not just and equal. Webelieve the bill has been drawn up with candor, ancs thatin it's distribution of influence to the diff ferent counties or districts, the committee were actuated by an honest care for the pulp lie good. Perhaps some features in the bill may be altered for the better; hut we a,e free to confess that we have no confidence in those members who profess great friendship for the bill, yet arc continually endeavoring to des- troy it, by proposing ten thousand amend ments. Candid, open opposers to the bill can be met by arguments, but an enemy under the garb of friendship, can only be met by the distrust and contempt of the more discerning part of community, while his acts pass off among the common readers as the fruits of patriotism and zeal for the pubic good.--- There are enemies to the districting system in the legislature, and we know it and we es- teem them no less for that, if they are open and candid in their opposition; but if they shield this opposition under prctended friendship for the principle, SO that they can the more effectualIy destroy the passage of the bill, and yet save their credit with their constituents, and pass off for disinterested le- gislators, who ''could not conscientiousIy vote for such a bill,\" such men we cannot esteem, and ifcalIed to speak of them shall never be found fattering their vanity. or pleading for their support. -\n\n The Committee to whom was referred the petition of the Trustees of Washington College, praying for pecuniary aid, have re- ported in favor of grant of $12, ,OOO, paya- ble in equal annual installments in $50, ,3l s, ,Ss. This sum, should the bill pass, will prove tolerably efficient, though not very timely help to the institution, excepting as it will warrant the trustees to borrow money upon the credit of the grant. From the report of the committee it appears that the institution is greatly in need of pecuniary aid. The ba'- lance against its treasury the last year amoun- ted to S1 ,S6S, and unless assistance be ob- tained from the state, or from private individ- uals, every year must increase the debt. Onr state IS rich we have an immense school fund; and every motive suggests that pccu- niary aid should be granted 10 our colleges and academies, proportioned to their need, and their means of advancing the literary influence of the state. Wise legislatures will not suffer the cause of literature to decline, from false notion of what constitutes e. economy in public expenditures. If the state mas SuFpiuS lunOS, leS our seats Of learning share literally in them; let not these funds be locked up in the state treasury. while the treasuries of those institutions which are the greatest honor to the state are suffering for the want of them.\n\n A bill has been brought beforc the lcgsla- ture for increasing the compensation allowed to printers for publishing the laws and the Comptroller's annual account. Some of the members thought the sum already allowed sufficient, while others supposed that if it were necessary the laws should be published in the different papers of the state, the pro prietors of these journals should be paid a fair compensation for their insertion. We of course should be pleased to receive some thing like fair price for our labor; we last year published all that the law required. and received about one tenth as much for the ser vice as would have been a fair charge against private individual for a similar use of our columns.

Lyon moved the yeas and nays up- on this notion carried.\n\n Mr. Storrs said the object of the amend ment was not so much to get the senate enlarged as to defeat the part of the bill which provided, that they should be cho- sen by districts: that the amendment had nothing to do with the number of the Sem ate,but merely as to the mode of choosing 1; no member can vote for the amendment without expressing an opinion as to some other mode of choosing them. He again said that the real object of the amendment was to destroy the principle of districting contained in the bill.\n\n Mir. Parish said that object had been imputed to him which he had disavowed in the sight of this house, and with the oath of God upon him.\n\n Mir. Storrs here explained.\n\n Mr. Parish said he did not suppose the gentleman intended to impute any impro- per motives to him. but that was the effect of his remark. He said his object was to present one point at time /; that the in- crease of the senate and the mode of choos- ing them were two distinct propositions.\n\n Afternoon.\n\n Mr. Shepard moved to postpone the 1st section and take up the 2d section-motion did not prevail.\n\n Mir.

Rider moved to amend the 2d sec- ton by substituting a new section--pro- viding that each county should constitute a district, and that no county should have more than senators nor less than 2. Mo- tio was not seconded.\n\n Mr. Shepard said he did not like to trou- ble the House often, but as the bill on the table allowed five districts, he would state, that it was important, that the people should be acquainted with the candidates, and there were variety of local interests, that fair representation of all parties in the Senate was the object of his heart; and if fair and just system of districting could not be obtained, he was opposed to' it, unless this was the object, it was mere bugbear.\n\n MT. Rider said-if all the members from Hartford county, voted with the gentle man Mir. Shepard,) they would do what they did not do very often. He wished to put it out ofthe power of the Legislature, to cut up counties, he had no idea of di- viding Middlesex county, and a part of it with New London County.\n\n Mr. May thought there was danger of over acting. By drawing the pendulum of a clock too far one way, it will swing back too far the othor way-there was danger that the bill would become dis trocting instead of districting bill-there was no danger of the small counties over balancing the larger ones.\n\n MT.

            "article": "\n\n mendment was to limit the Legislature, but a general bill was as bad as the present law; that he wished to have the question submitted to the people and submitted in such manner as would meet their appro- bation-that the difference between IS and 24 Districts would be latitude enough, that now they might put counties together that lawyers might be acquainted with the qualifications of persons in other counties but the greater part of the people could not be that some counties would have ted- eralists exclusively & some republicans ex- clusively-that the object of the amendment was togive every part of the community fair and equal representation in the Sen ate, and that the measure was just and honorable.\n\n Mr. Benedict said the amendment con- tained in it principle, which the House ought not to except-that if the amend ment prevailed it would acquire only plu- rality for the choice of a Senat6r-when the Senate ;s chosen by general ticket plu- rality can only he required, but it would be contrary to all practice for single Senator to be chosen by plurality; he noticed the\n\n  nor, representatives &c. who were all to be chosen by majority-shat if a plurality enly was required they might throw in man, who was not agreeable to a majority of his District-he thought in strong party times 1t would leave great room for the ex- crcise of intrigue in the division of Districts and would in the end lead to worse ronse- quences than were apprehended-that by the amendment the districts must be com posed of contiguous territory, but might be in different counties. in large counties there will be more difficulty in making conten- tions than in small ones, because there will be more steadiness of action. The great object is to give the Senate more strength and durability as at present constituted it is very fuctuating, the members are con- stantly changing-it is coordinate to be sure, but it ought to be also iudependant, so that they may check any sudden acts of this House, and not fear for their own safe- ty.-If the decision of particular Senator was not liked in his own District, his elec- ton might be dependant upon it; but it would not change the whole body-that time would be left for reflection and the cooling of passion, and the same Senators would be more likely to be returned again that steady member would have much more influence in the Senate, than mere passenger, who was expecting to be in that body but one year and consequently would not feel confidence in himself nor acquire influence over others. He said his object was to give the Senate more influence, ,bur if the amendme mt prevailed the evils of change would come upon us with more violence, and that party feeling excited, which was now dying away.\n\n MT. Shepard explained about majorities &c. The question, was then put upon the amendment and about 15 or 16 voted in favour of it.\n\n MT. Rider thought no bill ought to pass until it provided that the State should be districted by counties, he therefore moved an amendment to the 2d section to pro- vide districting by counties. He said that in 1925 bill passed by large vote allow ing 6 counties Senators each, ,and coun- ties 2 each. He thought it extraordinary if man weighing 300 pounds should bear more weight in the House than smaller one, and he thought there was no danger of the small counties trampling up- 1 on the larger ones\n\n MT. Boardman said that the bill alluded 1 to by the gentleman from Wilmington (Mr. Rider) was rejected last year by great majority. The Legislature have right to alter counties and if the amendment prevailed counties cannot be altered or greater inequality will be made; that it was desirable as far as practicable that the limits of counties should be preserved but it was better to make an amendment that would last forever, than one tha: would want to be changcd-if we amend the bill at all we ought to make an amendment that will meet the minds of the people.\n\n MT. s Raymond said the lines are nsw marked out and we know what to do; that the representation in the House was une- qual, and he noticed the inequality in that respect between the counties of Fairfield and Litchdeld. That the large States were frittering away their power by dis trictng for the choice of members of Con- gress, and he never should consent to dis trict the State for that purpose.\n\n MT. Warren said he thought they were getting the cart before the horse, that he used to be member of this house, and they then did not manage bushes as at present; inSfnoA If hoO tho had %I,o,, x,~a.o",

The bill proposes to alter the compensation of Jurors to $1,34 pr day. A long debate ensued on the motion to re- duce the sum to $1,25, in which Messrs. Hill, Shepard, Gurley, Cooley, May, War ren, and others took part, and which was negatived and the bill passed. Adj'nd.\n\n Tuesday morning May 22.\n\n MT. Shepard moved to take up the Dis trict Bill-after the same had been read, he moved an amendment to the 2d Sect. providing that there should be as many Districts as Senators. He observed that the subject of districting the State had occupied the attention of our citizens, and was a subject of deep interest, that the principal heretofore had not been adopted in this State, and was truly republican measure, that it was calculated to bring home knowledge of the candidates for of- fee to the people, and their qualifications would be fairly canvassed and understood were the State divided into small districts, each Senator would be well acquainted with the wants of his immediate -constituents,- that the measure was loudly called for at present, and the amendment he believed to be generally agreeable to the members.\n\n MT. Warren observed that he thought the Committee ought to have the privilege to explain, that in his opinion the subject ought to be left to the Legislature in fu- ture to decide, and that he was against any provision of the kind in tho Bill that it was in his view more just to bring Sena- tor from each section of the State, but he was against any restriction, SO that every Legislature may adapt the law to the con- tiugencies of the times.\n\n MT. Boardman, said, he was disposed to give great latitude both as to the number of Senators, and the number of the districts-that a large majority of the House was in favor of districting, but the great difficulty would be found in going into detail, that he was disposed to give some latitude to the Legislature, rather than tie their hands-that the difficulties attending bill in detail were greater than any man would suppose who had not sat down and made calculations upon the sub- ject, that the section as reported allowed some discretion (from to districts) but the present amendment allowed none at all, except as to the number. of Senator's that some of tine committee were for leav- ing out all restrictions as to the number of Districts. fla division could now be made 1t would be unjust after census that he believed majority of the House did not wish to extend the number of districts be- yond the number of counties. It was thought by the committee, that the State might hereafter be Districted for the choice ofmembers of Congress, and they had pro- vided that the State should not be divided into less than five Districts, because our representation in Congress might be redu- ced to that number that it would proba- bly, be disastrous to the Bill, if they com-\n\n III 1A1 N",

Every member de- cIares himself in favor of districting bill, but 1 all are not friendly to the bill now before the house. The truth is, the people have de- inanded the passage of a~biIl for districting the state, and members dare not openly oppose the measure; but as they dread the effects of I districtng, some ofthem, who are aware that they can politically thrive only under the gen eral ticket system, seem desirous of destroy ing the present bill, under the pretext that its principles are not just and equal. Webelieve the bill has been drawn up with candor, ancs thatin it's distribution of influence to the diff ferent counties or districts, the committee were actuated by an honest care for the pulp lie good. Perhaps some features in the bill may be altered for the better; hut we a,e free to confess that we have no confidence in those members who profess great friendship for the bill, yet arc continually endeavoring to des- troy it, by proposing ten thousand amend ments. Candid, open opposers to the bill can be met by arguments, but an enemy under the garb of friendship, can only be met by the distrust and contempt of the more discerning part of community, while his acts pass off among the common readers as the fruits of patriotism and zeal for the pubic good.--- There are enemies to the districting system in the legislature, and we know it and we es- teem them no less for that, if they are open and candid in their opposition; but if they shield this opposition under prctended friendship for the principle, SO that they can the more effectualIy destroy the passage of the bill, and yet save their credit with their constituents, and pass off for disinterested le- gislators, who ''could not conscientiousIy vote for such a bill,\" such men we cannot esteem, and ifcalIed to speak of them shall never be found fattering their vanity. or pleading for their support. -\n\n The Committee to whom was referred the petition of the Trustees of Washington College, praying for pecuniary aid, have re- ported in favor of grant of $12, ,OOO, paya- ble in equal annual installments in $50, ,3l s, ,Ss. This sum, should the bill pass, will prove tolerably efficient, though not very timely help to the institution, excepting as it will warrant the trustees to borrow money upon the credit of the grant. From the report of the committee it appears that the institution is greatly in need of pecuniary aid. The ba'- lance against its treasury the last year amoun- ted to S1 ,S6S, and unless assistance be ob- tained from the state, or from private individ- uals, every year must increase the debt. Onr state IS rich we have an immense school fund; and every motive suggests that pccu- niary aid should be granted 10 our colleges and academies, proportioned to their need, and their means of advancing the literary influence of the state. Wise legislatures will not suffer the cause of literature to decline, from false notion of what constitutes e. economy in public expenditures. If the state mas SuFpiuS lunOS, leS our seats Of learning share literally in them; let not these funds be locked up in the state treasury. while the treasuries of those institutions which are the greatest honor to the state are suffering for the want of them.\n\n A bill has been brought beforc the lcgsla- ture for increasing the compensation allowed to printers for publishing the laws and the Comptroller's annual account. Some of the members thought the sum already allowed sufficient, while others supposed that if it were necessary the laws should be published in the different papers of the state, the pro prietors of these journals should be paid a fair compensation for their insertion. We of course should be pleased to receive some thing like fair price for our labor; we last year published all that the law required. and received about one tenth as much for the ser vice as would have been a fair charge against private individual for a similar use of our columns.

Rider moved to amend the 2d sec- ton by substituting a new section--pro- viding that each county should constitute a district, and that no county should have more than senators nor less than 2. Mo- tio was not seconded.\n\n Mr. Shepard said he did not like to trou- ble the House often, but as the bill on the table allowed five districts, he would state, that it was important, that the people should be acquainted with the candidates, and there were variety of local interests, that fair representation of all parties in the Senate was the object of his heart; and if fair and just system of districting could not be obtained, he was opposed to' it, unless this was the object, it was mere bugbear.\n\n MT. Rider said-if all the members from Hartford county, voted with the gentle man Mir. Shepard,) they would do what they did not do very often. He wished to put it out ofthe power of the Legislature, to cut up counties, he had no idea of di- viding Middlesex county, and a part of it with New London County.\n\n Mr. May thought there was danger of over acting. By drawing the pendulum of a clock too far one way, it will swing back too far the othor way-there was danger that the bill would become dis trocting instead of districting bill-there was no danger of the small counties over balancing the larger ones.\n\n MT.

He was carefully removed by some good Samarit- ans, to a tavern, where medical aid was procured. On examination no wound ap- peared on his body, and the affair seemed very mysterious till yesterday, when he recovered in a measure from the effects of the steam with which he had been charged, and was able to stagger about quite bravely. The presumption is, that the butchers boys remained in slaughter house, near the place where he was first discovered, had found him intoxiCa cd, and after filling his hat with the blood of one of the cattle they had killed, put il on his head, and sent him adrift to scek his for tune in this situation.
