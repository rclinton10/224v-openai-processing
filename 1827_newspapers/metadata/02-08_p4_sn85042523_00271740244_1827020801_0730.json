This indigestion\nthus occasiened often causes violent chollcs\nwhich sometimes prove fatal. Surgeon\nWhite says\" Il have known many instances\nof this: and when we consider now often\npost and stage-coach horses are suddenly at\ntackled during their work with gripes OF\nfret, as it is commonly termed, arising en-\ntirely from this cause, it will appear aston\nishing that it has not excited the attention OF\npost masters and other proprietors.\n\n\nOats, which escape being crushed or brok-\nen- by the teeth, though properly soaked by\nthe saliva and Juice of the stomach, are not\nproperly digrsted. The following commu-\nnication from an English officer in the SER\nvice of the East India Company will sbew\nthe utility of brushing grain tor feeding\nhorses or cattle.\n\n\nII have always been an advocate for cut\ntinp hay and straw, and bruising corn (grain)\nfor cattle of every description, and am con-\nyinced that any man, who has pad atten-\nzion to the subject, will soon see the advant-\nage that must result from the adoption of\nthat practice. My attention was partlcu-\nlsrly called to this subject by circumstance\nwhich came under my notice when with the\ncavalry unQef Iluiu Lam, Oh VIZ \"N'NN 80\nbanks of the Junna in 1904. Channa, the\nusual food, being scantilysuppli ed, Lord\nLike ordered the horses to be fed with\nequal parts of channa and barley, bruised\nand steeped in the usual way; but from the\nirreyularity of the size of the barley and\nehanna. and nattention oil the part OF those,\nwhose duty it was to sec it prepared, the\ngreater part of the barley was given entire.\nand passed through the stomach and lntes-\ntines of the horses, apparently little, u al Az\nIMPAIRED in it's nutrtive quality ne scar\ncitv of grain which prevailed at that time n\ndnced MANY thousands to flock TO the Brat\nisb camp. in search of food, and daily wit\nressed for many weeks together many hun\ndreds of those people Of all ages; coming IN\nTO the lines of our cavalry, and anxlously col\nlecting and carrying away the excremeht as\nIl fell from the horses. This they exposed\nfew hours to the sun, and by rubbing and\nsitting it, procured a large supply of good\nfood. This detail, which is on son'e account\naffecting to humanity will probably go fur\nther in convincing the incredulous upon this\n.ubiect than the most ingenious theory. II\nmust prove to every unprejudiccd man that\na Drodigious waste takes place III the use o'\ncorn for horses when it is not previously\nground or bruised\"\n\n\n1t appears from the experience OF Mr.\nCurwen a celebrated English agriculturist\nthat the feeding of working horses OF\ncooked provender is highly profitable. One\ngreat advantage, he observes is the shor\ntime that is required for eating prope,\nquantity, and its more easy digestion ~\nhorse\" saws he, \"wiil take hours in eatine\nstone Ia lbs. of hay, whereas he will ca\nstone of steemcd potatoes in twenty MN\nutes\" A horse thus fed will therefore\nms ~ u than\nfed in the common way; and it is probable\nthat the stomach being thus quickly satited\nthe animal will be disposed to sleep or rest\nwhich is favorable to the digestive process\nIn letter from Mr.. Curwen to Mi. Peal\nthat gentleman observes. 81 can confirm AT\nTer the great and most extensive practice\nevery thing have formerly advanced will\nrespect to feeding horses on steamed pota\ntoes Ihave found it expedient to add a lit\ntie more straw with view to render tn\nfood less costly. A decisive distinction\nshould be made between cut straw and chatf\nin the husk or grain; the latter IS perfect\nindigestible and dangerous / strongly sus\nmeet | have lost horses formerly by its bein!\nused contrary to my orders. The practice\nof potatoe feeding has been adopted by sev\neral gentlemen upon large scale, all O\nwhom concur in declaring that the oppos.\nton to the relinquishing of this mode o\nfeeding would now be as great as it was t\nits adoption. / have found steamed straw\n(cut) very good food when could do no bet\nter\" Mr.. Curwen observes that horses fet\nupon steamed potatoes should have but lit\ntie water. and other writers say when horse\nare fed principally on steamed potatoes the.\ndo not need any water.\n\n\n\"When there is no convenience for bruis\ning oats, much good may be done by mix\ning them with clover or other hay cut u\nwith small proportion of straw. BY this\ntwo objects will be accomplished the oat\nwill be perfectly masticated, and, therefore\nwholly converted to nutriment: and vast\nOF hay will be prevented. Mr. Blaine, a\nENGLISH writer, thinks that three horse\nNAV be supported in this way at as little e%\npense as two kept in the usual manner. Th\nproportions lie recommends are one part ha'\nTWO of straw, and one of oats; and Of tn\nmixture he gives from three to six peel\ndaily, according TO the size and employmel\nof the horse: and he observes that 1t Will az\nvery much to the nutriment, which tt\nmixture affords, If the oats are previous\nbruised. Mr..

This indigestion\nthus occasiened often causes violent chollcs\nwhich sometimes prove fatal. Surgeon\nWhite says\" Il have known many instances\nof this: and when we consider now often\npost and stage-coach horses are suddenly at\ntackled during their work with gripes OF\nfret, as it is commonly termed, arising en-\ntirely from this cause, it will appear aston\nishing that it has not excited the attention OF\npost masters and other proprietors.\n\n\nOats, which escape being crushed or brok-\nen- by the teeth, though properly soaked by\nthe saliva and Juice of the stomach, are not\nproperly digrsted. The following commu-\nnication from an English officer in the SER\nvice of the East India Company will sbew\nthe utility of brushing grain tor feeding\nhorses or cattle.\n\n\nII have always been an advocate for cut\ntinp hay and straw, and bruising corn (grain)\nfor cattle of every description, and am con-\nyinced that any man, who has pad atten-\nzion to the subject, will soon see the advant-\nage that must result from the adoption of\nthat practice. My attention was partlcu-\nlsrly called to this subject by circumstance\nwhich came under my notice when with the\ncavalry unQef Iluiu Lam, Oh VIZ \"N'NN 80\nbanks of the Junna in 1904. Channa, the\nusual food, being scantilysuppli ed, Lord\nLike ordered the horses to be fed with\nequal parts of channa and barley, bruised\nand steeped in the usual way; but from the\nirreyularity of the size of the barley and\nehanna. and nattention oil the part OF those,\nwhose duty it was to sec it prepared, the\ngreater part of the barley was given entire.\nand passed through the stomach and lntes-\ntines of the horses, apparently little, u al Az\nIMPAIRED in it's nutrtive quality ne scar\ncitv of grain which prevailed at that time n\ndnced MANY thousands to flock TO the Brat\nisb camp. in search of food, and daily wit\nressed for many weeks together many hun\ndreds of those people Of all ages; coming IN\nTO the lines of our cavalry, and anxlously col\nlecting and carrying away the excremeht as\nIl fell from the horses. This they exposed\nfew hours to the sun, and by rubbing and\nsitting it, procured a large supply of good\nfood. This detail, which is on son'e account\naffecting to humanity will probably go fur\nther in convincing the incredulous upon this\n.ubiect than the most ingenious theory. II\nmust prove to every unprejudiccd man that\na Drodigious waste takes place III the use o'\ncorn for horses when it is not previously\nground or bruised\"\n\n\n1t appears from the experience OF Mr.\nCurwen a celebrated English agriculturist\nthat the feeding of working horses OF\ncooked provender is highly profitable. One\ngreat advantage, he observes is the shor\ntime that is required for eating prope,\nquantity, and its more easy digestion ~\nhorse\" saws he, \"wiil take hours in eatine\nstone Ia lbs. of hay, whereas he will ca\nstone of steemcd potatoes in twenty MN\nutes\" A horse thus fed will therefore\nms ~ u than\nfed in the common way; and it is probable\nthat the stomach being thus quickly satited\nthe animal will be disposed to sleep or rest\nwhich is favorable to the digestive process\nIn letter from Mr.. Curwen to Mi. Peal\nthat gentleman observes. 81 can confirm AT\nTer the great and most extensive practice\nevery thing have formerly advanced will\nrespect to feeding horses on steamed pota\ntoes Ihave found it expedient to add a lit\ntie more straw with view to render tn\nfood less costly. A decisive distinction\nshould be made between cut straw and chatf\nin the husk or grain; the latter IS perfect\nindigestible and dangerous / strongly sus\nmeet | have lost horses formerly by its bein!\nused contrary to my orders. The practice\nof potatoe feeding has been adopted by sev\neral gentlemen upon large scale, all O\nwhom concur in declaring that the oppos.\nton to the relinquishing of this mode o\nfeeding would now be as great as it was t\nits adoption. / have found steamed straw\n(cut) very good food when could do no bet\nter\" Mr.. Curwen observes that horses fet\nupon steamed potatoes should have but lit\ntie water. and other writers say when horse\nare fed principally on steamed potatoes the.\ndo not need any water.\n\n\n\"When there is no convenience for bruis\ning oats, much good may be done by mix\ning them with clover or other hay cut u\nwith small proportion of straw. BY this\ntwo objects will be accomplished the oat\nwill be perfectly masticated, and, therefore\nwholly converted to nutriment: and vast\nOF hay will be prevented. Mr. Blaine, a\nENGLISH writer, thinks that three horse\nNAV be supported in this way at as little e%\npense as two kept in the usual manner. Th\nproportions lie recommends are one part ha'\nTWO of straw, and one of oats; and Of tn\nmixture he gives from three to six peel\ndaily, according TO the size and employmel\nof the horse: and he observes that 1t Will az\nvery much to the nutriment, which tt\nmixture affords, If the oats are previous\nbruised. Mr.. White says, 81 am incline\nTO think that clover hay is preferable for tn\npurpose to any other. 1t is generally tho\nthat kind of hay is not well adapted for sa'\nd1o-horses or such as are emDlOye ed in Quir",
