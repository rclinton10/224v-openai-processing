M., and was or ganized by choosing Rev. Mir. Dove, of Thompson, M Moderator; and Rev. MT. Mer- 1 win of New Haven, Scribe. Various mat\n\n ters of business of davotion furnished dili-\n\n gent and highly profitable occupation of their\n\n time till Thursday night. The actual business of tine Connecticut Missionary Society, the Connecticut Branch of the American Education Society, was 1 transacted. The sermon before the General Association was preached Tuesday forenoon, by the Rev. Noah Smith from the text \"Mur- nlur not among yourselves; no man can come near me except the father that sent me\n\n draw him.\" The preacher showed that this\n\n inability was altogether an unwillingness,\n\n and pressed the conscience of the sinner\n\n with the alarming strength of his opposition to Christ and holiness. In the evening sermon\n\n was delivered by Rev. s. Green of Boston on\n\n the encouragements to prayer. \"And it shall come to pass before they call will answer\n\n & while they are yet speaking will hear\" At 10 o'clock Wednesday Morning, sermon\n\n was preached before the Connecticut Mis-\n\n sionary Society, by Rev. Noah Porter. Immediately after which an able and anima- ted report of the doings of the Americanl Ed\n\n ucation Society was read by the Secretary, Rev. l.. Bacon, of New Haven, followed with spirited addresses by Rev. MT. Lindsley of Hartford. Rev. Dr.. Chefter ofAlbany, N. Y.\n\n Rev. MT. Merwin, New-Haven, Rev. S. Green of Boston, Mass. and Rev. Elias Cor\n\n nelius, Secretary ofthe American Education\n\n Society.\n\n Ats o'clock F. M. very large cencourse of people assembled, from considerable dis tance, when narrative of the state of religion within the bounds of the General Association of Connecticut was read, presenting on the l whole such view ofthe present state and fui-\n\n ture prospect of that portion of our Zion as 1 must greatly comfort and encourage every heart.\n\n This interest was increased by several yer\n\n bal statements made by gentlemen who were\n\n delegates from foreign bodies, and blest with\n\n special revivals ofrelgion. Statementsrela- to Litchfeld County were of peculiarly en-\n\n couraging character, it appeared that most of\n\n the churches in that county were signally fav Ored at the present time. An interesting oc- currence was mentioned: in one church there was an individual who had some years\n\n come to the Lords table. A Christian broth\n\n CT had for some time attempting to deal with him according 10 the rules of the gospel. The\n\n church held meeting for prayer mutual con-\n\n fession and conference, at which it was\n\n expected brethren would be present from other churches where God was pouring out\n\n his Spirit. At the commencement of the\n\n meeting the brother who was dealing with the\n\n offender met him on the door step, and in-\n\n stead of admonishing him began to make confession to him that his motives and feeling | in his course of dealing with him, had been\n\n unholy, and greatly deficient in Christian\n\n love. Said the offending brother in surprise, supposed you wished me to make cOnfes- sion to you as ought, instead of your making confession to me. The feelings of these two\n\n brethren on the steps was immediately com\n\n municated to the brethren within. It melted\n\n them into tears, and they fell upon their\n\n knees and gave Godthe thanks.\n\n Another occurrence in the same county was\n\n mentioned. A woman had serious conyer- sation one morning with her husband on the\n\n duty of family prayer. He took his Bible, and after bordering the passage containing the resolution of Joshua, ''as for me and my house we win serve the Lord ;'' he wrote it on leaf and subscribed his name. His wife",

On the day of the rash act he had been reading The Up l holsterer, and the following parts were blis- tered with tears, and underlined in pencil \"Mr. Razor: I say Mr. Qnidnunc, can't sleep in my bed for thinking of the Protes- tants if the Papists should get the better\"\n\n Quidnunc; I'll tell your--the geographer of our coffee-house was saying the other day. that there is huge tract of land about the pole.

On receiving Mr. Canning notes, and finding that it was not probahe that he could occupy all these stations, 40 resolved on falling, not like Roman, on bis sword but on his head.

The following are the details of one of the most extraordin- ary of these incidents :l-Alb. Argus.\n\n In the year f79l, Capt. William Hubbell, who had recently removed to Kentucky from Vermont, with his family, and after having fixed his family in the neighbourhood of Frankfort, then a frontier settlement, had re- turned to the eastward on business and was second time on his way to Kentucky; by the Ohio River. On the Monongahela, one of the branches Ofthe Ohio, he procured fiat boat, and embarked with Mir. Daniel Light, Mir. William Plascut, and his family consist ing of his wife and eight children destined for Limestone, (Kentucky.) On their progress down the river Ohio, ,and soon after passing Pittsburgh, they saw evident traces of Indian foes along the banks and there was evident reason that boat which they overlook, and which, through carelessness, was suffered to run aground on an island, had become prey to these merciless savages. Though Captain Hubbell and his party stopped for some time in the low part of the river, it did not arrlve, and it has never been by them heard of since. Before they reached the Mouth the Great Kenhawa they had by several successive ad- ditions, increased their number to twenty, consisting of men, women, & 8 children. The men, besides those already named, were John Stoner, an Irishman and Dutchman, (WhOse names are mot .recOlleCted) Messrs. Ray & Tucker and MT. Fitzpatrick, who had two daughters also on board. Informa- tion received at GaIliopolis confirmed the ex- pectatiOn, which appearances had previously raised, of serious conflict with large body of Indians; and, as Capt. Hubbell had been regularly appointed commander of the boat. every possible preparation for formidable and successful resistance to any expected attack was promptly made. The nine men were divided into three watch es for the night, which were alternately to continue awake and be on the look out for 2 hours at time.-The arms on board which consisted principally of old muskets much out of order, were collected, loaded and put in the best possible condition for service. At about sunset on the 2Sd of March l79l, this party overlook fleet of six boats in compa- ny, and intended to have continued with them, but as their passengers seemed more disposed to dancing than fighting, and soon after dark, notwithstanding the remonstranccs of Capt. Hubbell, they commenced fddling, and dancing and drinking, instead of prepar- ing their arms and taking the rest preparato- ry to battle-it was deemed more hazardous to be in such company than to be without them.-It was therefore determined, to pro- ceed rapidly forward by aid of the oars, and to leave those thoughtless fellows behind.- One of the boats, however, belonging to the fleet, commanded by Captain Greenhouse, pursued the same plan for short time, but at length all the crew fell asleep, and the boat ceased to be propelled by oars fell behind, whilst Capt. Hubbell and his party glided forward steadily alone. Early in the night a canoe was dimly seen floating bown the river\n\n in which it was supposed there were Indians accommodating and other indications of the neighbourhood and hostile intentions of a formidable and savage party of Indians mo- ticed.\n\n It was now agreed, that should an attack, as was probable,he deferred till morning, every man should be up before the dawn of day. in order to make as great a show as possible, of numbers and of strength and. that whenev- CT an action should take place, the women and children should lie down on the cabin floor, and be protected as we'll as they could, by trunks and other baggage placed around them. In this perilous situation they contin- ued during the night, and the captain, who had not slept more than an hour since he lett\n\n Pittsburgh, was too deeply impressed with the eminent danger which surrounded them to obtain rest at that time.\n\n Just as day light began to appear in the east and before the men were up and at their posts agreeably to arrangement, voice at some distance below them in plaintive tone. re. peatedly solicited them to come on shore, as theresMere some white men who wished te obtain U passage in their boat. This the cap tain very naturally and correctly concluded te | be an Indian artiRce, and its only effect wa: | to rouse the men and place every one on hi",

G. a.\n\n NORTH CONSOLATION OF LITCHFIELD\n\n COUNTY.\n\n 7othe Editor of the Connecticut O6seruer.\n\n DEAR SIR,-I have just returned from the annual meeting of the North Association of Litchfeld County. Never did attend 80 interesting a meeting of this association be- fore... The usual complaint of prevailing coldness and indifference on the subject of re- ligion, among our congregations, not a single brother present had occasion to make. A spirit of revival, which may be defined to be an unusual spirit of piety and brotherly love, appeared to animate every heart present, and was manifest in all the prayers and dellbera- tions of the body. The following is an extract from their report on the state of reli- zion.\n\n \"The Association embraces within its lim- its 19 churches, 1S of which have at present settled pastors. Since the last annual report one pastor has been removed by death, one dismissed from his pastoral charge, and two settled. The additions to our respective churches during the year past, amount in all, tits estimated, from seventy-fiye to one hun dred.\n\n \"The present state of things among us, in a moral and religious respect, is interesting and animating to the heart that loves the cause of Zion. The shower of divine grace, which has been poured out on the region north of us, has extended also to us, and several of our churches have already shared largely in its refreshing influence. In Salisbury, Sharon North Canaan, South Canaan, and Norfolk, there has been for about two months past, that degree of religious excitement which is usually denominated a revival;\" and in each of the places the work of grace appears to be ILl d UTURi cSSlNC StAICs ! HC CuubGHCS VI VvUn. sted, New Hartford, Goshen, North Cornwall and Kent,where a few weeks since no unus,,- al attention to religion existed, are now en- toying incipient revivals of very encouraging promise. The churches of Winchester, Tor ringford, Ellsworth, South Cornwall, and Warren, the Spirit of God is likewise awak- ening from their moral apathy, imparting to them an unsual spirit of prayer and brotherly love, and affording them the anin1ating pros. pect of an approaching revival. The church in Colebrook has been in this state of religious excitement for several months past. It may he asserted without exaggeration, that in ev- cry church and congregation within our linn- its-with perhaps single exception-there is at present an unusually interesting state of re- Iigious feeling. At Canton, where revival has recently commenced, the Lord is now pouring out his Spirit in copious effusions. The place itself appears to be rendered very solemn by the special presence of the AL mighty.\n\n The late resignation in the British Cabinet have called into action the talents of the wits of London, who are by no means sparing of their shafts.

            "article": "For the Boston Recorder & Telegraph. GEN ERAL ASSOCIATION OF CONNECTICUT This body assembled at Stratford on Tues\n\n day the 18th II o'clock, A. M., and was or ganized by choosing Rev. Mir. Dove, of Thompson, M Moderator; and Rev. MT. Mer- 1 win of New Haven, Scribe. Various mat\n\n ters of business of davotion furnished dili-\n\n gent and highly profitable occupation of their\n\n time till Thursday night. The actual business of tine Connecticut Missionary Society, the Connecticut Branch of the American Education Society, was 1 transacted. The sermon before the General Association was preached Tuesday forenoon, by the Rev. Noah Smith from the text \"Mur- nlur not among yourselves; no man can come near me except the father that sent me\n\n draw him.\" The preacher showed that this\n\n inability was altogether an unwillingness,\n\n and pressed the conscience of the sinner\n\n with the alarming strength of his opposition to Christ and holiness. In the evening sermon\n\n was delivered by Rev. s. Green of Boston on\n\n the encouragements to prayer. \"And it shall come to pass before they call will answer\n\n & while they are yet speaking will hear\" At 10 o'clock Wednesday Morning, sermon\n\n was preached before the Connecticut Mis-\n\n sionary Society, by Rev. Noah Porter. Immediately after which an able and anima- ted report of the doings of the Americanl Ed\n\n ucation Society was read by the Secretary, Rev. l.. Bacon, of New Haven, followed with spirited addresses by Rev. MT. Lindsley of Hartford. Rev. Dr.. Chefter ofAlbany, N. Y.\n\n Rev. MT. Merwin, New-Haven, Rev. S. Green of Boston, Mass. and Rev. Elias Cor\n\n nelius, Secretary ofthe American Education\n\n Society.\n\n Ats o'clock F. M. very large cencourse of people assembled, from considerable dis tance, when narrative of the state of religion within the bounds of the General Association of Connecticut was read, presenting on the l whole such view ofthe present state and fui-\n\n ture prospect of that portion of our Zion as 1 must greatly comfort and encourage every heart.\n\n This interest was increased by several yer\n\n bal statements made by gentlemen who were\n\n delegates from foreign bodies, and blest with\n\n special revivals ofrelgion. Statementsrela- to Litchfeld County were of peculiarly en-\n\n couraging character, it appeared that most of\n\n the churches in that county were signally fav Ored at the present time. An interesting oc- currence was mentioned: in one church there was an individual who had some years\n\n come to the Lords table. A Christian broth\n\n CT had for some time attempting to deal with him according 10 the rules of the gospel. The\n\n church held meeting for prayer mutual con-\n\n fession and conference, at which it was\n\n expected brethren would be present from other churches where God was pouring out\n\n his Spirit. At the commencement of the\n\n meeting the brother who was dealing with the\n\n offender met him on the door step, and in-\n\n stead of admonishing him began to make confession to him that his motives and feeling | in his course of dealing with him, had been\n\n unholy, and greatly deficient in Christian\n\n love. Said the offending brother in surprise, supposed you wished me to make cOnfes- sion to you as ought, instead of your making confession to me. The feelings of these two\n\n brethren on the steps was immediately com\n\n municated to the brethren within. It melted\n\n them into tears, and they fell upon their\n\n knees and gave Godthe thanks.\n\n Another occurrence in the same county was\n\n mentioned. A woman had serious conyer- sation one morning with her husband on the\n\n duty of family prayer. He took his Bible, and after bordering the passage containing the resolution of Joshua, ''as for me and my house we win serve the Lord ;'' he wrote it on leaf and subscribed his name. His wife",

The following are the details of one of the most extraordin- ary of these incidents :l-Alb. Argus.\n\n In the year f79l, Capt. William Hubbell, who had recently removed to Kentucky from Vermont, with his family, and after having fixed his family in the neighbourhood of Frankfort, then a frontier settlement, had re- turned to the eastward on business and was second time on his way to Kentucky; by the Ohio River. On the Monongahela, one of the branches Ofthe Ohio, he procured fiat boat, and embarked with Mir. Daniel Light, Mir. William Plascut, and his family consist ing of his wife and eight children destined for Limestone, (Kentucky.) On their progress down the river Ohio, ,and soon after passing Pittsburgh, they saw evident traces of Indian foes along the banks and there was evident reason that boat which they overlook, and which, through carelessness, was suffered to run aground on an island, had become prey to these merciless savages. Though Captain Hubbell and his party stopped for some time in the low part of the river, it did not arrlve, and it has never been by them heard of since. Before they reached the Mouth the Great Kenhawa they had by several successive ad- ditions, increased their number to twenty, consisting of men, women, & 8 children. The men, besides those already named, were John Stoner, an Irishman and Dutchman, (WhOse names are mot .recOlleCted) Messrs. Ray & Tucker and MT. Fitzpatrick, who had two daughters also on board. Informa- tion received at GaIliopolis confirmed the ex- pectatiOn, which appearances had previously raised, of serious conflict with large body of Indians; and, as Capt. Hubbell had been regularly appointed commander of the boat. every possible preparation for formidable and successful resistance to any expected attack was promptly made. The nine men were divided into three watch es for the night, which were alternately to continue awake and be on the look out for 2 hours at time.-The arms on board which consisted principally of old muskets much out of order, were collected, loaded and put in the best possible condition for service. At about sunset on the 2Sd of March l79l, this party overlook fleet of six boats in compa- ny, and intended to have continued with them, but as their passengers seemed more disposed to dancing than fighting, and soon after dark, notwithstanding the remonstranccs of Capt. Hubbell, they commenced fddling, and dancing and drinking, instead of prepar- ing their arms and taking the rest preparato- ry to battle-it was deemed more hazardous to be in such company than to be without them.-It was therefore determined, to pro- ceed rapidly forward by aid of the oars, and to leave those thoughtless fellows behind.- One of the boats, however, belonging to the fleet, commanded by Captain Greenhouse, pursued the same plan for short time, but at length all the crew fell asleep, and the boat ceased to be propelled by oars fell behind, whilst Capt. Hubbell and his party glided forward steadily alone. Early in the night a canoe was dimly seen floating bown the river\n\n in which it was supposed there were Indians accommodating and other indications of the neighbourhood and hostile intentions of a formidable and savage party of Indians mo- ticed.\n\n It was now agreed, that should an attack, as was probable,he deferred till morning, every man should be up before the dawn of day. in order to make as great a show as possible, of numbers and of strength and. that whenev- CT an action should take place, the women and children should lie down on the cabin floor, and be protected as we'll as they could, by trunks and other baggage placed around them. In this perilous situation they contin- ued during the night, and the captain, who had not slept more than an hour since he lett\n\n Pittsburgh, was too deeply impressed with the eminent danger which surrounded them to obtain rest at that time.\n\n Just as day light began to appear in the east and before the men were up and at their posts agreeably to arrangement, voice at some distance below them in plaintive tone. re. peatedly solicited them to come on shore, as theresMere some white men who wished te obtain U passage in their boat.

Never did attend 80 interesting a meeting of this association be- fore... The usual complaint of prevailing coldness and indifference on the subject of re- ligion, among our congregations, not a single brother present had occasion to make. A spirit of revival, which may be defined to be an unusual spirit of piety and brotherly love, appeared to animate every heart present, and was manifest in all the prayers and dellbera- tions of the body. The following is an extract from their report on the state of reli- zion.\n\n \"The Association embraces within its lim- its 19 churches, 1S of which have at present settled pastors. Since the last annual report one pastor has been removed by death, one dismissed from his pastoral charge, and two settled. The additions to our respective churches during the year past, amount in all, tits estimated, from seventy-fiye to one hun dred.\n\n \"The present state of things among us, in a moral and religious respect, is interesting and animating to the heart that loves the cause of Zion. The shower of divine grace, which has been poured out on the region north of us, has extended also to us, and several of our churches have already shared largely in its refreshing influence. In Salisbury, Sharon North Canaan, South Canaan, and Norfolk, there has been for about two months past, that degree of religious excitement which is usually denominated a revival;\" and in each of the places the work of grace appears to be ILl d UTURi cSSlNC StAICs !

The church in Colebrook has been in this state of religious excitement for several months past. It may he asserted without exaggeration, that in ev- cry church and congregation within our linn- its-with perhaps single exception-there is at present an unusually interesting state of re- Iigious feeling.
