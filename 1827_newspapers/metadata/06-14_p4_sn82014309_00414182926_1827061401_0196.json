            "raw_text": "for business on Monday. at i, P. M. The officers of last year were reelected, ex- cept the Hon. Samuel Hubbard was cho- sen President in the place of the Hon. William Philips deceased. A Delegation from the Presbyterian Education Society was present, and the union of that society with this as Branch SOciety,wa consum- mated. The delegation were the Rev. Messrs. Hamilton, Patton and E. Lcrd Esq. In consequence of the Union, a large number of members were elected and the constitution was so altered as to enlarge the number of Directors from to 13, the number 5 still forming quorum. The new Directors chosen are John Tap pan Esq. of Boston, Author Tappan Esq. and Rev. c. Spring D. D. of New Y ork, and Hon. John c. Smith of Connecticut. The constitution was also amended, so as to give the election of Secretary to the So- ciety, ,instead of the Directors. The mee- tings of the Society are no longer confined to Boston, but may may be appointed to other places by the Directors.\n\n At half past the Society convened in Hanover Church 10 hear the report of the Directors and Addresses. The Rev. c. Hitchcock commenced with prayer. The report was read by the Rev. K. Cornelius, the Secretary. Motions were made or seconded by J. Evarts Esq, of Boston 1; E. Lord Esq, of New-Yo ork; Rev. E. Hooker of Goshen Conn. Rev. Mir. Patton, of the city of New ork Profess sor Newman, of Bowdoin College 1: Rev. MT. Hamilton, of Newark, N. J.; and Rev. Dr. Beecher, of Boston. All these gentlemen, except MT. Lord, addressed the meeting.\n\n MT. Evarts alluded to objections which were raised twelve years ago, when this society commenced its opperations, and inquired whether time eand experience had confirmed them, or removed them. lie believed he might, on this ground, chal- ienge for the Society complete and ab- solute triumph. 1t was said. there was not in our country very great Restitution of ministers ; ;but careful and extensive investigation has sweled the nnmber of waste places far beyond the first computa- tions. It was said, that numerous beneti- charles could not be procured; but the Lord hath raised them up. 1t was said, if they were prepared, they would not be received and settled; but the demand has increased beyond the supply, and calls for laborers were never more numerous or urgent than at the present moment It was alter wards said. some may not prove useful and successful preachers but the society IS not required to guarantya perfect charac- ter, or eminent usefulness. The church must still take ministers as imperfect men. and depend on God to make them useful. He believed that the plan and opperations of this body were now firmly established :; and that the prosecution of them would lead to glorious results. MT. E. adverted to the appointment of a Secretary or Gen. cral Agent, to be solely devoted to the concerns of the institution; and expressed his conviction, that such a measure is de- sirable for all the principal benevolent so- cieties. Yet Christians at large should not feel, that such agents will do the whole work; but should remember them with traternal regard, and each perform his own part as assigned him in the providence of God.\n\n Dr. Beecher remarked, that the laws of the natural world are uniform; and if it is not always so in the moral world, still some things are certain. We can have no doubt that the population of this great country will increase, and that we shall become a vast people; or that the spirit of enter prise will continue and increase abundant ly; or that these causes, unless counterac- ted, will nightly extend moral corruption. 1t is certain too, that tRefs' will be rsla- tive decrease of moral power, unless very special and powerful effort be made to sustain and increase it. We may, .howev- CT, bless God, that for this moral corrup- .tion and desolation there is remedy. There is power that can effect this, and but one. That is the gospel. Science, philosophy, legislation cannot do it. The gospel can do it. And in preparing min isters for the whole country, we send forth streams from that fountain to heal the land. We stand at the head of the most impor- tant river of influence ever known. How wicked are they, who stand there and aug ment the poison and death. How guilty are those who stand there with the gospel of healing in their hands, and do nothing. We as a society have undertaken the work, and we must march on as an united phalanx to accomplish it.-Again. success ascertain. There is gospel enough there will he hands enOuUh to carry if thera",

Yet the information which he has received, in ad- ditiOn to what the Directors before possessed, enables, them to communicate the following statement of facts.-Of those who have been patronized by the Society from it's com mencement. 73 have been settled as Pastors Of churches, in l4 different States; all of whom, it is believed, yet sustain that office, except 4 or \" ho have died or been dismiss ed.

DISTRIBUTION OF TRACTS IN NETWORK.\n\n At meeting of the managers of the New York City Tract Society, many interesting facts were related, relative to the circulation of Tracts in this city. One gentleman be- longing to the Hucksters' committee, had di- rected his attention particularly to Fulton, Franklin and Catharine Markets; and had distributed to the amount of 1S,OOO pages Other gentleman of the Board, not on the Committee for distribution, expressed a de- sire to receive Tracts, and it was finally re- solved that any member of the Board might draw upon the Chairman of the Executive Committee, for whatever amount he might wish to distribute, on condition of reporting to the Board, as. far as practicable, the beni- fcial effects. Should funds be wanted to meet the necessary expenses, it was believed they would be promptly supplied.\n\n The Committee of Steam boats reported that they had supplied II boats, each with 12 volums of Tracts, neatly bound. In every case they were thankfully received, and as- surance was given that they would be care fully preserved, and devoted to the use of the passengers.\n\n The Shipping Committee reported that since their organization, their Chairman had given orders for 113,OOO pages of Tracts, near ly all of which have been distributed. It was the united voice of the Committee, that seamen are ready, willing, and in many cases anxious, to receive the messages of mercy. One of the number reported the following incidents:\n\n ''I supplied the crew of the ship Huron with Tracts, and among the rest a man who was intoxicated ;-though dobted the pro- priety of giving any to him. Not long after l met this man and had the happiness to find him sober. He took me by the hand in a most friendly manner, and said The Tracts you gave me are very good things; was Ips,IN RN1A",

            "headline": "From the Boston Recorder. AMERICAN EDUCATION SOCIETY",
            "article": "for business on Monday. at i, P. M. The officers of last year were reelected, ex- cept the Hon. Samuel Hubbard was cho- sen President in the place of the Hon. William Philips deceased. A Delegation from the Presbyterian Education Society was present, and the union of that society with this as Branch SOciety,wa consum- mated. The delegation were the Rev. Messrs. Hamilton, Patton and E. Lcrd Esq. In consequence of the Union, a large number of members were elected and the constitution was so altered as to enlarge the number of Directors from to 13, the number 5 still forming quorum. The new Directors chosen are John Tap pan Esq. of Boston, Author Tappan Esq. and Rev. c. Spring D. D. of New Y ork, and Hon. John c. Smith of Connecticut. The constitution was also amended, so as to give the election of Secretary to the So- ciety, ,instead of the Directors. The mee- tings of the Society are no longer confined to Boston, but may may be appointed to other places by the Directors.\n\n At half past the Society convened in Hanover Church 10 hear the report of the Directors and Addresses. The Rev. c. Hitchcock commenced with prayer. The report was read by the Rev. K. Cornelius, the Secretary. Motions were made or seconded by J. Evarts Esq, of Boston 1; E. Lord Esq, of New-Yo ork; Rev. E. Hooker of Goshen Conn. Rev. Mir. Patton, of the city of New ork Profess sor Newman, of Bowdoin College 1: Rev. MT. Hamilton, of Newark, N. J.; and Rev. Dr. Beecher, of Boston. All these gentlemen, except MT. Lord, addressed the meeting.\n\n MT. Evarts alluded to objections which were raised twelve years ago, when this society commenced its opperations, and inquired whether time eand experience had confirmed them, or removed them. lie believed he might, on this ground, chal- ienge for the Society complete and ab- solute triumph. 1t was said. there was not in our country very great Restitution of ministers ; ;but careful and extensive investigation has sweled the nnmber of waste places far beyond the first computa- tions. It was said, that numerous beneti- charles could not be procured; but the Lord hath raised them up. 1t was said, if they were prepared, they would not be received and settled; but the demand has increased beyond the supply, and calls for laborers were never more numerous or urgent than at the present moment It was alter wards said. some may not prove useful and successful preachers but the society IS not required to guarantya perfect charac- ter, or eminent usefulness. The church must still take ministers as imperfect men. and depend on God to make them useful. He believed that the plan and opperations of this body were now firmly established :; and that the prosecution of them would lead to glorious results. MT. E. adverted to the appointment of a Secretary or Gen. cral Agent, to be solely devoted to the concerns of the institution; and expressed his conviction, that such a measure is de- sirable for all the principal benevolent so- cieties. Yet Christians at large should not feel, that such agents will do the whole work; but should remember them with traternal regard, and each perform his own part as assigned him in the providence of God.\n\n Dr. Beecher remarked, that the laws of the natural world are uniform; and if it is not always so in the moral world, still some things are certain. We can have no doubt that the population of this great country will increase, and that we shall become a vast people; or that the spirit of enter prise will continue and increase abundant ly; or that these causes, unless counterac- ted, will nightly extend moral corruption. 1t is certain too, that tRefs' will be rsla- tive decrease of moral power, unless very special and powerful effort be made to sustain and increase it. We may, .howev- CT, bless God, that for this moral corrup- .tion and desolation there is remedy. There is power that can effect this, and but one. That is the gospel. Science, philosophy, legislation cannot do it. The gospel can do it. And in preparing min isters for the whole country, we send forth streams from that fountain to heal the land. We stand at the head of the most impor- tant river of influence ever known. How wicked are they, who stand there and aug ment the poison and death. How guilty are those who stand there with the gospel of healing in their hands, and do nothing. We as a society have undertaken the work, and we must march on as an united phalanx to accomplish it.-Again. success ascertain. There is gospel enough there will he hands enOuUh to carry if thera",

They have resided in nineteen, or tGCeRty, states and have pursued their studies in as many colleges, and at more than forty acad- emies. Some have been aided only for few months, and others through the whole course of their academic studies.\n\n The Secretary has paid particular atten- tiOn to the result of past efforts, which is ye- ry difficult to ascertain with accuracy. Yet the information which he has received, in ad- ditiOn to what the Directors before possessed, enables, them to communicate the following statement of facts.-Of those who have been patronized by the Society from it's com mencement. 73 have been settled as Pastors Of churches, in l4 different States; all of whom, it is believed, yet sustain that office, except 4 or \" ho have died or been dismiss ed. Six or seven have devoted themselves to the work of foreign Missionaries two of these. the lamented Mosely and Chapman, have already ceased from their lab0rs, and their bodies lie buried far in the wilderness of America. Four have been ordained aa E- UGngeiists, and others as Domestic MisSion- aries. Thirty three are preaching as LiccD- ti0teS and Candidates for settlement; secen are Licentiotes, and at the same time, {'astruc- tors of youth; and ttCo others who have re- ceived ordination, have been called to sta tlons of eminent usefulness, in connexlOn with two of the largest benevolent societies in the country. Thus it. is ascerttined, that of those whom lht' society has assisted since its formation only ttoeiye years ego oFE aUND- RED AND TH5nTY-sEv&N have become prea- chers of the Gospel. Their voice is heard every Sabbath day, by thousands and tens of thousands of immortal beings in various and remote places of our lands. Some of them have been blessed with reviyals of religion and every year sWeliS the number of those who will regard lhein, forever, as the nstru ments, under God, of their salvation. Forty .fue are employed as Teachers, four as pro fsssors, or tutors, in colleges, and the remain ing number, for the most part, as instructors, for a time, Of academies.\n\n Not far from haif of He 'ohole nwnaber sOho haUe receiued aid from the society, are now in various stages of their preparatory studies.

From tlOenty to thirty it is expected will finish their, preparatory course, and commence preaching the present yo\"I.\n\n Funds.-.'hc amount of donations and of other sources ot Alsposi,ble income during the year, as appears from the Treasurer's report, is SlS,428 ga. The amount of expenditures is S12,OOs C9. About sixty scholarships of 5000 each have been subscribed, part of them payable in five years, and a large part has already been paid into the hands of the Treasurer on account of them. DISTRIBUTION OF TRACTS IN NETWORK.\n\n At meeting of the managers of the New York City Tract Society, many interesting facts were related, relative to the circulation of Tracts in this city. One gentleman be- longing to the Hucksters' committee, had di- rected his attention particularly to Fulton, Franklin and Catharine Markets; and had distributed to the amount of 1S,OOO pages Other gentleman of the Board, not on the Committee for distribution, expressed a de- sire to receive Tracts, and it was finally re- solved that any member of the Board might draw upon the Chairman of the Executive Committee, for whatever amount he might wish to distribute, on condition of reporting to the Board, as. far as practicable, the beni- fcial effects. Should funds be wanted to meet the necessary expenses, it was believed they would be promptly supplied.\n\n The Committee of Steam boats reported that they had supplied II boats, each with 12 volums of Tracts, neatly bound. In every case they were thankfully received, and as- surance was given that they would be care fully preserved, and devoted to the use of the passengers.\n\n The Shipping Committee reported that since their organization, their Chairman had given orders for 113,OOO pages of Tracts, near ly all of which have been distributed. It was the united voice of the Committee, that seamen are ready, willing, and in many cases anxious, to receive the messages of mercy. One of the number reported the following incidents:\n\n ''I supplied the crew of the ship Huron with Tracts, and among the rest a man who was intoxicated ;-though dobted the pro- priety of giving any to him. Not long after l met this man and had the happiness to find him sober. He took me by the hand in a most friendly manner, and said The Tracts you gave me are very good things; was Ips,IN RN1A",
