Clinton of this state for the vice\npresidency. We have always believed, ,notwithstan-\nding all that has been said by the jackson newspa-\npers to the contrary that the party would in the end,\ndrop Mr. Calhoun, and take UP some candidate for\nthe ohce, farther north, east; than South Carolina.\nThat they should turn their eyes to this State, for\nthe purpo Of securing, if possible, its great weight\nin tie scale of the election, is very natural. Nor\nwould it at all surprise u.s. ifthey should be desirous\nOF selecting Mr.. Clinton, as the most suitable person,\nunder the circumstances for their candidate. But\nwe do much doubt, if the overtures should be made\n\n\nto him whether he would consent to the proposition:\nthere arc many reasons why we hesitate at giving\ncre'll! to this story. Some of them We will men\nton.\n\n\nIn the first place, Mr. Clinton, having long been\nengaged in politics, has had the benefit Of much ex-\nperlcnce in men and measures. tie cannot. there\nfore be ignorant Of the fact, that he is not AM, new\ncr was. and we think it may BE- safely said. never\nwill be popular at the South. He has always been\naz obvc, Of dread to their active and ardent politi-\nclans, and Of course, of deep and bitter reproarh for\nhi, ambitious feelings and views. This shas been par\nlicularly the case in Virginia. The feelings of the\npoliticians Of that state always lnilnlcal to every\nperson eastward of their borders. whose talents char\nacter and accompl mplishment, would point him out to\npublic attention as fit person to be placed at the\nhead of the national government. And the strength\nof their anmosity would be displayed in exact pro-\nportion to the probability that the particular object\nof might stand greater or less chance ot success.\nMr.. Clinton can not have forgotten the unmeasured\noboquy that was heaped upon him at the South,\nand especially ii Virginia. because in 1872 the peo\nPile, in snme parts of the Union. thought proper to\nexercise their prsiegci in holding him up. in oppo-\nston to MIR. Madison. as candidate Tor the presl-\ndency. This is sin not to be forgiven and SO it\nwill be found. Until the last presidential election,\nthe electors Of that State never gave solitary vote\nfnr any individual as candidate for the presdency\nwho did not belong t the State. And al the last cleo\n\n\non, having no person that they could bring forward.\n\n\ntheir stock having been exhausted, they were forced\nto venture ont of their liHts and they took Mr..\nCrawford, who had the second rate merit OF having\nbeen born in Virginia.\n\n\nBESIDES the jealousy Of Virginia towards the State\nOf Ncw-York as always been more active, and more\nvrulent than towards any, and perhaps all other\nStates. The rapidly increasing numbers, and the\ngrowing wealth. and prosperity Of this State, give it\nan undouhtcd claim to be placed AT The head ut the\nJnion and it ought long since to have been the\nfact that ITS weight aud influence as such should\nhave been felt and acknowledged Unfortunately\nthe political affairs of the State have been permitted\nto be under the management and control OF lndivd-\nuas from time to time, who were unworthy OF such\n| a tr,st-ni.n who barercd its power and influence,\nsacrificed its Importance and rendered it subseivi-\nent 10 an interest and an ambition, wholly inconsis\n\n\nrent with its weight and character. That control\n\n\nand influence still exist and il there is any serious\ndisposition aiming the partizans OF Gen. Jackson, to\nsupport Governor Clinton for the Vice Presidency\n| il will require lio uncommon insah into human al\n\n\nfairs. or the human character, to ascertain from what\nquarter such measure has proceeded. Governor\n\n\nClinton may rely upon it, that it is not founded UP\n\n\non aiy real respect for him it is selfish IN the ex\ntrclne and he cannot expect to escape from the\ncharge of nding his talents and character to for\n\n\nward the views aud interests OF his most bitter and\npersecutng enemies. The salary Of the Vice Presl\ndencv would be but poor compensation Tor such de-\ngradation as this.\nIn the next place, it is, we think. impossible tina\n\n\nGovernor Clinton should not be perfectly aware tina\n\n\nIf the electoral vote of this State is secured for Gen\n\n\neral Jackson it will be the result OF another nilu\nence. rather than his own. HoWeve: we'll Genera\n/. jackson may think of Governor Clinton. he mus\n, think better Of Mir. Van Buren, II the New Yorl\nvotes are for Gen. JACKSON it will be owing to tn\n: influence Of MIR. Van Buren OF course. il any per\n\n\nson is tc be rewarded for such distinguished, such II\n+ valuable service, it must be Mr.. Van Buren,, an\nnot tiovernor Clinton. 1t is difficult for us to bellev\n\n\nthat Governor Clinton's dignity can stoup to th\n\n\nWe do not expect ever TO see him the traInbeart\n\n\nof his most active, most perseverlng and most unr\n\n\nlenting political adversary.\nT. We think that Governor Clinton must be convn\ned, that if he is ever advanced to any place OF di\nn tineuished honor under the national government,\np will be owing TO Noriheyn and not to Southern i\nnf nuence. The foundation Of the present mallsnal\nK opposition to Mr. Adams. unquestionaby rests up'\nof SLAVERY.

Clinton of this state for the vice\npresidency. We have always believed, ,notwithstan-\nding all that has been said by the jackson newspa-\npers to the contrary that the party would in the end,\ndrop Mr. Calhoun, and take UP some candidate for\nthe ohce, farther north, east; than South Carolina.\nThat they should turn their eyes to this State, for\nthe purpo Of securing, if possible, its great weight\nin tie scale of the election, is very natural. Nor\nwould it at all surprise u.s. ifthey should be desirous\nOF selecting Mr.. Clinton, as the most suitable person,\nunder the circumstances for their candidate. But\nwe do much doubt, if the overtures should be made\n\n\nto him whether he would consent to the proposition:\nthere arc many reasons why we hesitate at giving\ncre'll! to this story. Some of them We will men\nton.\n\n\nIn the first place, Mr. Clinton, having long been\nengaged in politics, has had the benefit Of much ex-\nperlcnce in men and measures. tie cannot. there\nfore be ignorant Of the fact, that he is not AM, new\ncr was. and we think it may BE- safely said. never\nwill be popular at the South. He has always been\naz obvc, Of dread to their active and ardent politi-\nclans, and Of course, of deep and bitter reproarh for\nhi, ambitious feelings and views. This shas been par\nlicularly the case in Virginia. The feelings of the\npoliticians Of that state always lnilnlcal to every\nperson eastward of their borders. whose talents char\nacter and accompl mplishment, would point him out to\npublic attention as fit person to be placed at the\nhead of the national government. And the strength\nof their anmosity would be displayed in exact pro-\nportion to the probability that the particular object\nof might stand greater or less chance ot success.\nMr.. Clinton can not have forgotten the unmeasured\noboquy that was heaped upon him at the South,\nand especially ii Virginia. because in 1872 the peo\nPile, in snme parts of the Union. thought proper to\nexercise their prsiegci in holding him up. in oppo-\nston to MIR. Madison. as candidate Tor the presl-\ndency. This is sin not to be forgiven and SO it\nwill be found. Until the last presidential election,\nthe electors Of that State never gave solitary vote\nfnr any individual as candidate for the presdency\nwho did not belong t the State. And al the last cleo\n\n\non, having no person that they could bring forward.\n\n\ntheir stock having been exhausted, they were forced\nto venture ont of their liHts and they took Mr..\nCrawford, who had the second rate merit OF having\nbeen born in Virginia.\n\n\nBESIDES the jealousy Of Virginia towards the State\nOf Ncw-York as always been more active, and more\nvrulent than towards any, and perhaps all other\nStates. The rapidly increasing numbers, and the\ngrowing wealth. and prosperity Of this State, give it\nan undouhtcd claim to be placed AT The head ut the\nJnion and it ought long since to have been the\nfact that ITS weight aud influence as such should\nhave been felt and acknowledged Unfortunately\nthe political affairs of the State have been permitted\nto be under the management and control OF lndivd-\nuas from time to time, who were unworthy OF such\n| a tr,st-ni.n who barercd its power and influence,\nsacrificed its Importance and rendered it subseivi-\nent 10 an interest and an ambition, wholly inconsis\n\n\nrent with its weight and character. That control\n\n\nand influence still exist and il there is any serious\ndisposition aiming the partizans OF Gen. Jackson, to\nsupport Governor Clinton for the Vice Presidency\n| il will require lio uncommon insah into human al\n\n\nfairs. or the human character, to ascertain from what\nquarter such measure has proceeded. Governor\n\n\nClinton may rely upon it, that it is not founded UP\n\n\non aiy real respect for him it is selfish IN the ex\ntrclne and he cannot expect to escape from the\ncharge of nding his talents and character to for\n\n\nward the views aud interests OF his most bitter and\npersecutng enemies. The salary Of the Vice Presl\ndencv would be but poor compensation Tor such de-\ngradation as this.\nIn the next place, it is, we think. impossible tina\n\n\nGovernor Clinton should not be perfectly aware tina\n\n\nIf the electoral vote of this State is secured for Gen\n\n\neral Jackson it will be the result OF another nilu\nence. rather than his own.
