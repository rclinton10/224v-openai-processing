Had he not been inter-\nrupted, he would instantly have been taken\nby the Indians without the firing of single\ngun. So completely were his thoughts occu-\npied with his little bird, that he forgot to\nmention the circumstance OF the dying BUSH\nes.

Reluct-\nant as he felt to be left in the woods sur\nrounded by savages, he considered it the on\n| ly alternative, and followed the advice.-Ac-\ncorlingly the first opportunity that present.\ned itself, he jumped aside from the path, and\nlay close behind log. The Indians soon\ncame along, and eagre in the pursuit to over\ntake those whom they still saw before them,\npassed by Downing who lay trembling by the\nway side. About ten minutes after they\nPASSED, he ventured to raise and leave his\nplace of concealment-for some time how\never, he was utterly at loss what course\nto pursue. To go back towards the Lick\n\n\nwas his first thought. but it was abandoned\nalmost as soon as conceived. In this state\nof uncertainty, he slowly walked along the\npath in the direction the Indians had taken.\n\n\nA little reflection, however, convinced him\nof the danger of this course; as it was very\nprobable they would soon turn and come the\nsame direction back-he therefore left the\npath, and, after wandering through the\nwoods, reached the fort in safety, several\nhours after his companions, who had outrun\ntheir pursuers and returned likwise.",

Downing, went out\nin search q horse that had strayed away\nfrom the fort. After travelling six or eight\nmiles in search of the horse, Downing be-\ngan 10 be alarmed at the idea of danger\nfrom Indians, and observed to Yates, (who\nwas much older than himself, and to whom\nhe locked Up for protection) that he thought\nhe heard noise like sticks cracking behind\nthem, Yates laughed at him anc told him\nnot to be a coward--tMat it was oHly his I'M\nagnetiun, and that there was no danger\nwhatever. Downing, however, was not\nconvinced, but embraced the first favorable\nopportunity tIfordcd him for conccalnent,\nto step in a thick cluster Of whortclberry\nbushes, while Yates went on. ln few\nminutes an Indian was seen by Downing,\nrunning towards him, until he was within a\nbout one hundred yards, when he suddenly\nstopped. Downing to use his own express\n| ion, was as it were, Mtnder&trnck.

Both\nparties ran on until they reached dry gut\nter in the middle of the valley. about six\nfeet deep, and Of considerable width. The\n| Indians had, by this time approached very\nnear them, and attempted to leap across the\ngutter at about the same time With the\nwhites. All got across safe except Mt u.\nwho Just reached the edge OF the gutter, \"a\ngainst which striking his foot, he fell upon\nhis breas, rebounded and fell backwards in-\nto the gutter. The violence OF the fail al\nmost deprived him Of breath tor time, but\nfortunately the Indians were too intent upon\nthe chase to observe his remaining behind,\nand both happening to direct their attention\nsolely to MIR. Yates, continued to pursue\nhin. Mr.. Downing at length recovering\nfrom the shock, walked along IN the gutter,\nwhich grew shalower as he advanced, and\nsoon ceased to serve the purpose OF conceal\ning him from the sight OF the lniians. At\nlength he discovered one of them returning\nin search of him he instantly dropped his\ngun. left the gutter, and ran back the same\n\n\nwav he had come.--The injury he had re-\nceived from his fall, affected his speed, and\nthe Inlian gained upon him rapidly. After\nrunning a considerable distance, considering\nhis case a desperate ono, and his being over\ntaken inevitable, he came to large poplar\n\n\ntree, which had been blown down by. the\n\n\nwind, II so happened that wh'lstHhe ran a.\nlong one side of the tree, the lndian pursued\n\n\nhim on the other. At this critical momcnt,\n\n\nhe felt himself caught by the leg, ana was\n\n\ncompelled to make momentary pause,\n\n\nwhen he perceived that he had been stop\"\n\n\nped by a small dog, which instantly ran q\n\n\nway from him. This pause mac gwen 10\nthe Indian considerable advantage, and he\n\n\npercejyed himself likely TO be caught at\n\n\nthe root of the tree. Mos' fortunately how\n\n\never lust at that spot, a large she bear had\n\n\ntaken up her abode with several cubs. Not\n\n\nbeing pleased with the violence with Which\n\n\nthe Indian approached her young, she IN\n\n\nstantly attacked him, when Mr. Downing,\ntaking advantage of the interference OF TINS\nunexpected coadjutor, suddenly wheeled\naround, and left the savage engaged IN\n\n\nmost violent struggle with his new adversa-\nnv. What was the result of the rencounter,\n\n\nwe are not informed. 1t had, however, the\nhappy effect of preserving Mr.. Downing\nfrom almost inevitable destruction; and as\nno remains of the Indian was ever alter\n\n\nwards found, at or near the place, it is prop\n\n\nable he escaped with his life, it not without\nconsiderable injury.\n\n\nMr.. Yates likewise succeeded in getting\noff unhurt. After running several miles, he\nconcealed himself amidst trees or in Cane\nDrake, and he thus eluded the pursuit, and\n\n\nreturned home safe.\n\n\n1t was custom with Mr. Downing, i'll the\n\n\nsummer, about the time referred to above,\n\n\nto go out of the fort every afternoon, to\n\n\ncluster OF hickory trees, several hundrea\n\n\nyards distant, for the purpose OF shooting\n\n\nsquirrels, which at that place were very hu\n\n\nmerous.-Near his path, (as he afterwards\n\n\ns:scovered) fifteen Indians lay concealed tor\nthree davs, behind large log, where they\n\n\nhad placed a number of bushes to serve as a\nblind. there waiting for a favorable oppor-\n\n\ntuntv to kill some one or more men, and Oh\ntain y,luuder",

On the third day he observed\nthat the bushes around the log were appa-\nrently dying, and being unable to conjecture\nthe cause, was attracted by curiosity to-\nwards the spot, and had advanced to within\nabout ten feet, for the purpose of ascertain\ning what was the matter, when his atten~\ntion was caught by the auttering of a beauti-\nfull bird, entangled in some burs just by him.\nHe instantly turned and caught the bird,\nwhich drew of his curiosity about the dying\nbushes, and he returned to the fort and\nspent the remainder of the day in making q\ncage for his bird. Had he not been inter-\nrupted, he would instantly have been taken\nby the Indians without the firing of single\ngun. So completely were his thoughts occu-\npied with his little bird, that he forgot to\nmention the circumstance OF the dying BUSH\nes. The next morning early, pack-horse\ndriver and his son went out to see after their\nhorses when the concealed Indians shot\nthem both, scalped and stripped them before\nthe people of the fort who heard the guns,\ncould get to the place. They having pre-\nviousy stolen and secured number OF hors-\nes, they instantly made off.\n\n\nOne Sunday morning three men, one by\nthe name OF Poor, another named Wade,\nthe name of the third not recollected, who\nhad been in the habit of accommodating the\ncountry in the capacity OF spies, proposed\nto Mr.. Downing to so with them to Mud\nLick, now the Olympian Springs, seven\nmiles distant from the fort. They accord\n\n\nngly set out together on foot, and travelled\nunmolested until they came i'll sight of the\nLck.-As they ascended hill, they dicov-\ncred several hundred buffaloes, elks and\ndeer, which they considered an indication\nthat there were no Indians there; but whilst\nthey were surveying the prospects and were\ndescending the hill, Poor and Wade, who\nwere some distance in advance OF Downing\nand his companion, suddenly turned round\nand gave notice that there were ten or tt-\nteen Indians sitting and endeavoring to con-\nceal themselves in the drain that proceeded\n! from the Lick, and that it was necessary\nthat thev should ny for their lives. They\nImmediately tarted and ran with all possi-\nBILE speed, but soon heard the Indians behind\nthem. The pursued took one path and the\npursuers took another, but after short dis\ntance the two paths came together-the\nwhites however, reached the point of junction\nbefore the Indians, although the latter gain\ned the choice of paths. Young Downing be-\n| iilH Sthdll, duu hoi ihC mo w\" \"PobA0hS az\n\n\ncustomed to running, was unable to keep up\nwith them, and was advised as the only\nchance of escape, to embrace the first oP-\nportunity when the situation of the road\nshould throw them out of sight of the Indi-\nans, to step behind log and lie concealed\nwhilst the rest OF the party ran on. Reluct-\nant as he felt to be left in the woods sur\nrounded by savages, he considered it the on\n| ly alternative, and followed the advice.-Ac-\ncorlingly the first opportunity that present.\ned itself, he jumped aside from the path, and\nlay close behind log. The Indians soon\ncame along, and eagre in the pursuit to over\ntake those whom they still saw before them,\npassed by Downing who lay trembling by the\nway side. About ten minutes after they\nPASSED, he ventured to raise and leave his\nplace of concealment-for some time how\never, he was utterly at loss what course\nto pursue. To go back towards the Lick\n\n\nwas his first thought. but it was abandoned\nalmost as soon as conceived. In this state\nof uncertainty, he slowly walked along the\npath in the direction the Indians had taken.\n\n\nA little reflection, however, convinced him\nof the danger of this course; as it was very\nprobable they would soon turn and come the\nsame direction back-he therefore left the\npath, and, after wandering through the\nwoods, reached the fort in safety, several\nhours after his companions, who had outrun\ntheir pursuers and returned likwise.",

            "article": "In the month of August 1886, Mr.. Francis\nDowning then lad lived in fort, where\nsoon afterwards, an Ironworks was erected\nby Mr.. Jacob Myers, which is known as\nthe Slate cpeek works. and owned by Col.\nThomas Dye Owings. 4\n\n\nOne morning young man by the name OF\nYates, together with Mr.. Downing, went out\nin search q horse that had strayed away\nfrom the fort. After travelling six or eight\nmiles in search of the horse, Downing be-\ngan 10 be alarmed at the idea of danger\nfrom Indians, and observed to Yates, (who\nwas much older than himself, and to whom\nhe locked Up for protection) that he thought\nhe heard noise like sticks cracking behind\nthem, Yates laughed at him anc told him\nnot to be a coward--tMat it was oHly his I'M\nagnetiun, and that there was no danger\nwhatever. Downing, however, was not\nconvinced, but embraced the first favorable\nopportunity tIfordcd him for conccalnent,\nto step in a thick cluster Of whortclberry\nbushes, while Yates went on. ln few\nminutes an Indian was seen by Downing,\nrunning towards him, until he was within a\nbout one hundred yards, when he suddenly\nstopped. Downing to use his own express\n| ion, was as it were, Mtnder&trnck. He re-\nsolved however, as he had gun, to fire and\nrun, but unfortunately his gun having\ndouble trigger, before he raised her to his\nface, she went off, and, as he remarks, ne IN\nstantly 7vent oftoo! After running some\ndistance, he met Yates, who having heard\nthe report of the gun, had turned to ascer-\ntain what was the matter, and learning that\nthev were closely pursued by Indians, they\nran together At length they reached de-\nclivity, and we're compelled, in following the\npath, to de scend into valley surrounded by\nVILLA Iar fhav Indians. who\n| had taken shorter route, and were running\n| by another route towards the bottom OF the\n! v lley There was no alternative; It was\nabsolutely necessary to keep the path and\nto run with the utmost possible rapidity, al\nthough from the superior knowledge possess\ned by the Indians ofdfferent roads. they had\ngained considerably on the pursued, and\nseemed likely soon to overtake them. Both\nparties ran on until they reached dry gut\nter in the middle of the valley. about six\nfeet deep, and Of considerable width. The\n| Indians had, by this time approached very\nnear them, and attempted to leap across the\ngutter at about the same time With the\nwhites. All got across safe except Mt u.\nwho Just reached the edge OF the gutter, \"a\ngainst which striking his foot, he fell upon\nhis breas, rebounded and fell backwards in-\nto the gutter. The violence OF the fail al\nmost deprived him Of breath tor time, but\nfortunately the Indians were too intent upon\nthe chase to observe his remaining behind,\nand both happening to direct their attention\nsolely to MIR. Yates, continued to pursue\nhin. Mr.. Downing at length recovering\nfrom the shock, walked along IN the gutter,\nwhich grew shalower as he advanced, and\nsoon ceased to serve the purpose OF conceal\ning him from the sight OF the lniians. At\nlength he discovered one of them returning\nin search of him he instantly dropped his\ngun. left the gutter, and ran back the same\n\n\nwav he had come.--The injury he had re-\nceived from his fall, affected his speed, and\nthe Inlian gained upon him rapidly. After\nrunning a considerable distance, considering\nhis case a desperate ono, and his being over\ntaken inevitable, he came to large poplar\n\n\ntree, which had been blown down by. the\n\n\nwind, II so happened that wh'lstHhe ran a.\nlong one side of the tree, the lndian pursued\n\n\nhim on the other. At this critical momcnt,\n\n\nhe felt himself caught by the leg, ana was\n\n\ncompelled to make momentary pause,\n\n\nwhen he perceived that he had been stop\"\n\n\nped by a small dog, which instantly ran q\n\n\nway from him. This pause mac gwen 10\nthe Indian considerable advantage, and he\n\n\npercejyed himself likely TO be caught at\n\n\nthe root of the tree. Mos' fortunately how\n\n\never lust at that spot, a large she bear had\n\n\ntaken up her abode with several cubs. Not\n\n\nbeing pleased with the violence with Which\n\n\nthe Indian approached her young, she IN\n\n\nstantly attacked him, when Mr. Downing,\ntaking advantage of the interference OF TINS\nunexpected coadjutor, suddenly wheeled\naround, and left the savage engaged IN\n\n\nmost violent struggle with his new adversa-\nnv. What was the result of the rencounter,\n\n\nwe are not informed. 1t had, however, the\nhappy effect of preserving Mr.. Downing\nfrom almost inevitable destruction; and as\nno remains of the Indian was ever alter\n\n\nwards found, at or near the place, it is prop\n\n\nable he escaped with his life, it not without\nconsiderable injury.\n\n\nMr.. Yates likewise succeeded in getting\noff unhurt. After running several miles, he\nconcealed himself amidst trees or in Cane\nDrake, and he thus eluded the pursuit, and\n\n\nreturned home safe.\n\n\n1t was custom with Mr. Downing, i'll the\n\n\nsummer, about the time referred to above,\n\n\nto go out of the fort every afternoon, to\n\n\ncluster OF hickory trees, several hundrea\n\n\nyards distant, for the purpose OF shooting\n\n\nsquirrels, which at that place were very hu\n\n\nmerous.-Near his path, (as he afterwards\n\n\ns:scovered) fifteen Indians lay concealed tor\nthree davs, behind large log, where they\n\n\nhad placed a number of bushes to serve as a\nblind. there waiting for a favorable oppor-\n\n\ntuntv to kill some one or more men, and Oh\ntain y,luuder",
