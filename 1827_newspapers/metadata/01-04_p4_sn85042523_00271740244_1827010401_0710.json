He asserts, that, not\nwthstanding all the pompous articles that\nhave filled the pages of the French Journals,\nthese goats are very different from those OF\nTibet, which produce the down of the cell\nebrated Cashmere shawls; and he believes\nthe public has been imposed upon by spec\nulators. He gives the following history OF\nthe introduction of these animals into France\n\n\nA few wears since M. Jaubert set out for\nTibet for the purpose of obtaining certain\nnumber of goats, but having arrived at\nConstantinople, he was convinced that he\nshould expose himself to many dangers in\nattempting to reach Tibet, and he learnt\nthat he could easily purchase goats among\nthe Klrghis and Tartars From the nforma-\nton he o,5tained, he was induced to believe\nthat the goats of the Kmghis and Tartars\nwere of the same species as those ot Flbet,\nnot considering there is distance OF 600\nleagues between these two countries. IL\npurchased great number of these klrghis\nand Tartar goats, put them on board OF\nvessels, anil they arrived i'll France, under\nthe name Of Cashmere S }Ats. NJ. ilabrlc-\n\n\nder, a gentleman who resided some years\n| at Astrachan on the Caspian Sea, wrote to\nM. Ihaer that he was astonshei TO see NJ\nJaubert sending to France the miserable\n! kirehis goats, which cost IN the country less\nthan IS cents per head. he kirghis and\n! Tartars comb their goats, and get some very\n\n\nfine down which they make into cloth. but\n\n\nait is probable\" says Nj. rhaer, \"that our\n\n\ngoats would offer the same advantages. =\n| It is said that the English East India Com\n\n\npany have several nmes attempted 10 in.\n\n\ntroduce the goats of Tibet into their pos\n\n\nsessions, adjoining that country, but have\n\n\nnever been able to obtain them from the\n\n\ngrand Lama",

            "article": "NJ. Thaer has lately published an article\nin German Journal, relative to the Cash\nmere goats, so called, which have been nat\nuralzed in France. He asserts, that, not\nwthstanding all the pompous articles that\nhave filled the pages of the French Journals,\nthese goats are very different from those OF\nTibet, which produce the down of the cell\nebrated Cashmere shawls; and he believes\nthe public has been imposed upon by spec\nulators. He gives the following history OF\nthe introduction of these animals into France\n\n\nA few wears since M. Jaubert set out for\nTibet for the purpose of obtaining certain\nnumber of goats, but having arrived at\nConstantinople, he was convinced that he\nshould expose himself to many dangers in\nattempting to reach Tibet, and he learnt\nthat he could easily purchase goats among\nthe Klrghis and Tartars From the nforma-\nton he o,5tained, he was induced to believe\nthat the goats of the Kmghis and Tartars\nwere of the same species as those ot Flbet,\nnot considering there is distance OF 600\nleagues between these two countries. IL\npurchased great number of these klrghis\nand Tartar goats, put them on board OF\nvessels, anil they arrived i'll France, under\nthe name Of Cashmere S }Ats. NJ. ilabrlc-\n\n\nder, a gentleman who resided some years\n| at Astrachan on the Caspian Sea, wrote to\nM. Ihaer that he was astonshei TO see NJ\nJaubert sending to France the miserable\n! kirehis goats, which cost IN the country less\nthan IS cents per head. he kirghis and\n! Tartars comb their goats, and get some very\n\n\nfine down which they make into cloth. but\n\n\nait is probable\" says Nj. rhaer, \"that our\n\n\ngoats would offer the same advantages. =\n| It is said that the English East India Com\n\n\npany have several nmes attempted 10 in.\n\n\ntroduce the goats of Tibet into their pos\n\n\nsessions, adjoining that country, but have\n\n\nnever been able to obtain them from the\n\n\ngrand Lama",
