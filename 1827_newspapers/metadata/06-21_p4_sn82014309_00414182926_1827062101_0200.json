He will there be out of danger; he can learn English to better advantage, than here; and when the Armen- ian press arrives, his service will be wanted to correct the proof sheets. We have great hopes of his future usefulness.'\n\n INTERESTING LETTER\n\n From the Sandscich lslGnds Mission, to the Assistant Secretary, published in the Boston Daily Aduertissr.\n\n ToHAIGH BAY, GOs0hyhee,) Nov. 8, 1928.\n\n My DEAR RRoTHER,-I snatch few mo- ments this evening to improve an opportunity that offers to send to America by way of Wo- ahoo, in writing nasty letter to you, my dis tant brother.\n\n We have. oflate, been priviledged by a visit from several of the chiefs of the Leeward isl- ands, who we hope belong to the kingdom of our Lord. They spent month or upwards at Kiruah and vicinity, where we have been gratified and encouraged by their example and inilnenee in behalf of religion. 06e feet of their visit is to extend the Knowledge of Christ and his Gospel to all their people i; and to prepare them for the reception of a code of Christian laws. In the prosecution of this object, they have come hither, where are assembled the whole people, inhabiting Kohula and Hamakua to receive the laws which are about to be pablished. have also improved the occasion to follow them in or der to preach the Gospel to the many thou sands here collected. I arrived here this morning ina canoe, having left my home yes ferday, and hoped to be enabled to preach to the peoR)s daily until my return.\n\n MT. Rinn ham and family still rc,nain af",

They bore the spelling of their goods with fortitude knowing it was for righ- eousness' sake that they were called to suffer: but they yielded not an inch in complying with the demands of the ships; and the sail ors at last abandoned their search, and hir- ed their captains to take them to Woahoo, in h hopes of getting women there. This is hut specirnine of the abuse and insult that inc mission is daily receiving from our own cOun- trymen and other foreigners, who leave no means untried to bring into discredit, not only us, hut all who profess to have become piOus.\n\n The principal spite of foreigners is levelled against our dear brother and fellow laborer, MT. Bingham: but you may be assured, that the brethren consider it common cause, and equally as much against the whole body as a. gainst him; and we feel 1t to be our duty publicly to give him and his measures, so far as they have come to our knOwlege, our deci- ded appreciation.\n\n Sabbath evening NoU. 5.\n\n I have just returned from the service of this day. where have preached twice to congregation of more then fen MouS1nd listen ing hearers. They were assembled in coca- nut grove, and delivered my message to them in open air.-The stiffness of this inn mense multitude the solemn occasion upon which we had met; the thought that all this people would pass into eternity in the lapse of few years; gave a solemnity and an inter- est to the scene. which have seldom felt. The Lord help me to speak as one standing between the two worlds,-as an ambassador of reconciliation between God and his fallen creature man, revealing to him covenant of grace.\n\n 5 It is a truly interesting and pleasant. service tobe the messenger of peace to perishing immortals; and, in q special manner, this the persuasion, that those, fer whose good we are iabouring, are anxiously desirous of the light and knowledge that lead to salvation. Such, my brother, is the state of this peo- pie. There was never, perhaps, a time when the prospect of complete success to our en- terprize was greater than at present. Could y0h but witness, for one day, the order, the attention, the anxious, eager look, and ob- serve the tear start from the eye of the tawny sun-burnt savage, and the countenance of hope and joy as he casts his eye upward to heaven upon hearing the terms of pardoning mercy proclaimed to him, your heart would leap for joy, and you would give God thanks for hsrisg puf ;be tile hearts of.aaE to come over the wHs Waste. of water that divides Iis, to preach salvation to this people, who hayal. long been sitting in darkness and the shadoa of death. kT\n\n But must leave you here, as the messea ger waits to carry this to Woabao eaa' 'Remem Der me affectionately to al! my Christian friends in Boston, assure them of the undi- unfinished regard which and Mrs. Bishop still feel towards them, and of the happiness which we enjoy in the blessed work in which we are engaged.-Adieu.\n\n Yours affectionately, in the best bonds,\n\n ARTEMAs BISHOP.\n\n From ZScss Herald.\n\n 4 tender scene.-A minister of the LordI Jesus once called together the elders of a church that he had gathered from the world. He was about to leave them, and the impress sion was strong on his mind that he should never see his beloved people again on earth. None hut child of God can conceive the sublimity of feeling that pervaded scene like this. Memory traverses the past, fingers moment over each fond incident, and recalls every tender association. This scene resem- ] les death, because it is a separation, and be- cause the same solemn mOurnfulness of the heart is called into action that death awakens. This minister of Jesus stood in the midst of the aged and venerable of the church, and made this affectionate address :-\n\n Since have been with you, u,beloved breth- -ren, you have known my labours, my anxie- ties, my cares. You know my humility, the strength of the temptations that surrounded, me, and the bitter prosecutions of my ene- mics. You can testify that in my doctrines have withheld nothing calculated to do you good. have taught you in the great con- gregation and from house to house. My| doctrine has been, repentance towards God and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christi\" Il am now going to distant city, where, al- though the visien of the future is clouded with uncertainty, feel assured of meeting severe trials but of one thing have no doubt -I shall never see your faces amy more. Oh, I cannot but remember how 1 have preached to you the kingdom of God, and call upon you to bear witness that upon my gar ments the blood of your immortal souls shall not ever be found in the day of judg- ment.\n\n Ye fathers of the church, look we'll to your selves, and tenderly remember the flock over whom the Holy Ghost hath placed you as a guard.

They bore the spelling of their goods with fortitude knowing it was for righ- eousness' sake that they were called to suffer: but they yielded not an inch in complying with the demands of the ships; and the sail ors at last abandoned their search, and hir- ed their captains to take them to Woahoo, in h hopes of getting women there. This is hut specirnine of the abuse and insult that inc mission is daily receiving from our own cOun- trymen and other foreigners, who leave no means untried to bring into discredit, not only us, hut all who profess to have become piOus.\n\n The principal spite of foreigners is levelled against our dear brother and fellow laborer, MT. Bingham: but you may be assured, that the brethren consider it common cause, and equally as much against the whole body as a. gainst him; and we feel 1t to be our duty publicly to give him and his measures, so far as they have come to our knOwlege, our deci- ded appreciation.\n\n Sabbath evening NoU. 5.\n\n I have just returned from the service of this day. where have preached twice to congregation of more then fen MouS1nd listen ing hearers.

The Lord help me to speak as one standing between the two worlds,-as an ambassador of reconciliation between God and his fallen creature man, revealing to him covenant of grace.\n\n 5 It is a truly interesting and pleasant. service tobe the messenger of peace to perishing immortals; and, in q special manner, this the persuasion, that those, fer whose good we are iabouring, are anxiously desirous of the light and knowledge that lead to salvation. Such, my brother, is the state of this peo- pie. There was never, perhaps, a time when the prospect of complete success to our en- terprize was greater than at present. Could y0h but witness, for one day, the order, the attention, the anxious, eager look, and ob- serve the tear start from the eye of the tawny sun-burnt savage, and the countenance of hope and joy as he casts his eye upward to heaven upon hearing the terms of pardoning mercy proclaimed to him, your heart would leap for joy, and you would give God thanks for hsrisg puf ;be tile hearts of.aaE to come over the wHs Waste. of water that divides Iis, to preach salvation to this people, who hayal. long been sitting in darkness and the shadoa of death. kT\n\n But must leave you here, as the messea ger waits to carry this to Woabao eaa' 'Remem Der me affectionately to al! my Christian friends in Boston, assure them of the undi- unfinished regard which and Mrs. Bishop still feel towards them, and of the happiness which we enjoy in the blessed work in which we are engaged.-Adieu.\n\n Yours affectionately, in the best bonds,\n\n ARTEMAs BISHOP.\n\n From ZScss Herald.\n\n 4 tender scene.-A minister of the LordI Jesus once called together the elders of a church that he had gathered from the world. He was about to leave them, and the impress sion was strong on his mind that he should never see his beloved people again on earth. None hut child of God can conceive the sublimity of feeling that pervaded scene like this. Memory traverses the past, fingers moment over each fond incident, and recalls every tender association. This scene resem- ] les death, because it is a separation, and be- cause the same solemn mOurnfulness of the heart is called into action that death awakens. This minister of Jesus stood in the midst of the aged and venerable of the church, and made this affectionate address :-\n\n Since have been with you, u,beloved breth- -ren, you have known my labours, my anxie- ties, my cares. You know my humility, the strength of the temptations that surrounded, me, and the bitter prosecutions of my ene- mics.
