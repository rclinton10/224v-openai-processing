She had at no time withheld her vote or her support from distinguished in- dividuals, citizens of other states.

He remembered that there was a time when she and Massachusetts had stood together, shoulder to shoulder, the leading champions of independence and liberty. But it could not escape observa- ton, that during the whole period now near 40 years, in which the present government had existed, Virginia had never once giv- on her vote for the office of President, to any but native of her own State. There was another thing not altogether unwor- thy of observation. The ground of objec- ton to the election of the present Presi- dent was, that he was not the leading candidate before the people-that another\n\n received more votes than he, and that oth- CT, as approaching nearer to the choice of the people. ought to have been elected.

He had been chosen principally by the north- ern and the western States, and since an organized and extensive opposition had been raised, for no reason that he(Mr. w knew of, except simply that he had been chosen, it seemed the duty of those who had placed him in office t, give him fair and just support.\n\n lift were the general sentiment then, as he believed it to be, that the adminis- tration ought to be supported, against per- sonaF or groundless opposition, the ques- ton was, how should that support be rem dered.

If the permission be true, let not the conclusion be too hastily admitted. What was the nature of these differences On what did this distinction of parties rest They were not distinct orders in the state. with sep- perate and unequal privileges. They were not the Palrician and Popular part ties of Rnme, nor the feudal or landed in- terest, arrayed against the mercantile and industrious classes, as in some modern states. In these last instances, there were permanent grounds of difference, arising fron opposing interests. Cur differences on the contrary have been mere differen- ces of opinion upon questions of govern ment, and on its public measures The rich and the poor, the learned, and the un- learned. the powerful and the feeble, were found on both sides of the question.

S.-There Is a very important opening on board American and English vessels at Smyrma for the distribution of fEngish Tracts. The few we had with us, have proved very acceptable, and we have had repeated sOli- citations fir more. Thus far, we have every Sabbath held a meeting on board some yes sel. Our congregation, Sabbath before last, on board the AmeFican slOOp of war OntariO, consisted of 275 men.\n\n X A public meeting of the citizens or DOS ton, friendly to the National and ot1te Administrations was held at Faneuil Hall on the evening of the 20th inst. A res\"- lution was offered and adopted expressing the determination of the meeting to sup port by all fair and honorable means the present Nationaland State Administration. It was further resolved, that it IS expedi- ent that the city of Boston should be rep rese ented in the General Court by such men as will consult the great interest of the State and nation, regardless of all party distinction and local prejudices and nu- merous committee was appointed [\" select a list of candidates and report the same to an adjourned meeting. Several gentle\n\n men addressed the meeting on the ocoa- sion, and among others the Hon. DANIEL.\n\n WEBSTER, in the following speech: as\n\n Spscch cf Mr. Webster, at the meeting\n\n in Faneuil- Hal, on Friday evening last\n\n -as reported for the Daily Advertiser. MT. Webster said, that there were ma ny and obvious reasons, why he might have wished to fobear taking any part in the proceedings of this meeting. Never, theless as the object of it was one which he entirely approved, he felt it his duty to express that appreciation, aud to take\n\n his part in the responsibility belonging | to the occasion. Notwithstanding the | odium which some attempted to attach to\n\n what they are pleased to call amalgama- l ton, he entertained the belief that the l time had come, when it was important, and | indeed indispensable, for those who enter\n\n tain similar opinions, and sought to pro- ] mote similar objects, to act with united council. and united force. The resolutions\n\n which have been read, by his friend in the gallery Mr. Child, expressed the opin- ion that it was expedient for those who ap- prove the general course of the govern ment, to unite, without reference to for- mer party, in the election of members to the legislature, favorable to that govern ment, and inclined to give it a sincere and hearty support. As bearing on this ques- ton, it might be proper to look cn the ac- tual state of things.\n\n The last President, Mir. Monroe, had been elected for his second term of office by a vote almost, or entirely unanimous.\n\n The course of his administration, gener- ally speaking, was satisfactory and accept- able. But with this gentleman he list of candidates, for the office of president, whose claims rested on revolutionary mer- its and services, terminated. An election was next to be. made, from a new genera ton of men; and that happened, which was quite natural, and should surprise no one, that several candidates were proposed and supported by their friends. The east and the west, the north and the south, put forth their respective favorites. In conn- try so extensive, it need be no cause of wonder, when the class of revolutionary patriots was gone, that opinions should not uuttC duy OuS SoHuiuhtC3 OI cVcU Ut UI~ vided between any two candidates for the l highest office. We had no Caesars to be- stride the land like colossus. Our Rome encompassed many men, distinguished for talents and services, and who in the cir- cies where they were best known, were respectively deemed worthy of the highest honours. In this state of things, the late election came on, and no candidates re- ceived a majority of all the votes. The ultimate election of course devolved on the 1 House of Representatives, and the choice fell on distinguished citizen of this Com- monwealth. Bnt ere he was entered on bis office, a thorough and determined opposition was commenced. It did not wait to guide his judgment by the meas .ure of the new administration, but found- ed itself entirely on the choice that had been made, and complaining only that an- other choice had n, t been made, it seemed disposed, not to allow men the common privilige of standing or falling according to the merits of their conduct For his own part, he had no hesitation to say, that he looked upon such principal of opposition, as dangerous to the very being of govern ment.

It is the unso- cial, dreary abode of Monks and Nuns. Here, through the double grating of their dark and gloomy rccesses we saw these delllded se- questered females. It was heart-sickenlllg sight. How far from the precepts of that a. posfle, whom Publius once, in this very city, lodged three days cOurteously, and to whose name spleudid churches are here now dedica- ted, and costly monuments erected. St. Paurs Cathedral, according to tradition, Oc- cupies the very spot where Publins lived. 1t is a more beautiful, but less expensive edi. fee than the church of St. Joha's. Its paint ings surpass all have eyer seen; among the most splendid of which, is the shipwreck Of the Apostle.\n\n Near Citta Vecchia is the entrance of the Catacombs. These are artificial, subterrane v an excavations ia the solid rock. Passages just sufficient to admit a single person, are carried in many different directions and tO great distances. They are said to extend in one direction two miles; and in another sev en. As many according to report, have here lost their way and perished, the entrances are now closed up. They open on each side, at short intervals into what appear to have been the abodes of men. Que, far more spacious the rest, not imprubably was chapel.

In some of these inches single body only was laid in others whole family appear to have been deposited side by side ;-sOme of the scpulchres being those of full grown persons, and others those of infants.\n\n Besides the two cities, there are, in the Va rious parts ofthe Island, twenty or thirty vil-\n\n \n\n and all of them are we'll furnished with churches.

Popery is to the soul what the pestilence is to the body.-it impovishes--de- grades-destroys. There is no calculating the sums it lavishes upon sacred edfces. idle Nuns. and crowds of lazy Priests. 1t has ex- torted untold treasures, poured it into the church, turned thousand peennyless on the world.a d crowded every street with beggars.\n\n 1t denies access to the foundation of all knowledge.

When the President came into office he stated frankly and honestly that in his opinion, sacrifice of party feeling, and party prejudice was to be made. His sentiments had been full, and emph atic, st.ing out upon this basis, how could.it be said that the administra- ; ton was supported by those, who, while they professed friendship for it, denounced and prescribed others, who felt as much friend- ship for it as themselves. For his own part he thought it no want of charity to distrist such pretensions. How was It to be expected of men, who had no more in- terest than others in the matter, that they would be willing to breast the Opposition with which the administration was assail- ed if at the same time they and their friends were 10 be held out as objects of distrust and jealousy, and made the subjects of a narrow, selfish and exclusive policy? Had we not seen enough the result of such course In alluding to the inaugural sen- timents of the President, he did not mean to say, that they were any other than might have been expected, from either of the other candidates. Most of of them, if not all, he believed, had expressed similar sen- timents. Certainly the distinguished cite izen, who is candidate in opposition, had expressed such sentiments.-They were the necessary result of events. Differing in many other things, all parties had a. greed, in welcoming the peace 1915. The French revolution with all the sympathies and its antiquities, was then at an end. { Our own foreign relations were amicably adjusted, and the alien of party was con- sumed. So apparent was this, that he re- collected to have heard gentleman equal- ly distinguished for quick perception and forcible expression, say, at the moment of the peace, to the manner in which corpo- ration are sometimes dissolved, each of the two parties will now break its common seal.

When it was thought peter by those who are opposed to the administration, to preserve party distinctions, they were pre- serued, and they are disregarded when it is better for the promotion of their own ob- jects, to disregard them.\n\n In this state of things he did not know, what benefit was proposed, by those who were friends to the administration, by dis union and division. They who had cleo ted the present President, if they remain united and firm, were capable of sustain ing him, and maintaining him in all just measures.

CDtxainly he thought the present President\n\n was entitled to somewhat kinder treatment than that which he had received. He was\n\n citizen of Massachusetts, State not un- known nor undistingHished in the history of the country. She had manifested no exclusive regard to those who belonged to herself. She had at no time withheld her vote or her support from distinguished in- dividuals, citizens of other states. Vir- gipia for example had given four Presi- dents to the Union, and for three of these, at least Massachusetts gave her vote, and when she had not given her vote, as in MT. Monroe'S first election, her support of the\n\n President was sincere and zealous because she found no reason to complain of his measures 1t was not therefore unnatur- al to expect, that when a citizen of Mas sachusetts had been elected in constitu- tional manner, to fill the same office, he might at least have experienced the com mon candor of being judged by his acts.\n\n He wished to speak with great respect of\n\n Virginia. He remembered that there was a time when she and Massachusetts had stood together, shoulder to shoulder, the leading champions of independence and liberty. But it could not escape observa- ton, that during the whole period now near 40 years, in which the present government had existed, Virginia had never once giv- on her vote for the office of President, to any but native of her own State. There was another thing not altogether unwor- thy of observation. The ground of objec- ton to the election of the present Presi- dent was, that he was not the leading candidate before the people-that another\n\n received more votes than he, and that oth- CT, as approaching nearer to the choice of the people. ought to have been elected. N0% it is somewhat curious, that this com- plaint should be most loudly made, by\n\n those who supported not the highest, but\n\n the lowest candidate by those who gave their OWE votes for him who came with the least recommend dation fromfhe people, and who have endeavoured in vain to elect him to the presidency, now charge disre- spect for the public sentiment, an absolute effrontery on those who voted for candi- date, who had received twice as much sup- port, in the popular elections as their own.\n\n The President had received the vote of the people of this State, and the vote also of the Representative in Congress. He had been chosen principally by the north- ern and the western States, and since an organized and extensive opposition had been raised, for no reason that he(Mr. w knew of, except simply that he had been chosen, it seemed the duty of those who had placed him in office t, give him fair and just support.\n\n lift were the general sentiment then, as he believed it to be, that the adminis- tration ought to be supported, against per- sonaF or groundless opposition, the ques- ton was, how should that support be rem dered. Spcaking.in in reference to parties that had hitherto existed in the Common wealth, were these parties to unite, and to act with concert and effect, or were they still to preserve towards each other an att titude of coldness and distance, if not of hostility, although their sentiments and ob- jects were now acknowledged to be the same For his own part, he thought such a question answered in the stating of it. Could there be case, in which union was more pecessary,o ,or disunion more senselessl It was said indeed that parties had existed in the Commonwealth for thiry years that they had differed on leading questions that these differences had gone deep and wide-and that therefore il would be im- practicable now to feconcile them. If the permission be true, let not the conclusion be too hastily admitted. What was the nature of these differences On what did this distinction of parties rest They were not distinct orders in the state. with sep- perate and unequal privileges. They were not the Palrician and Popular part ties of Rnme, nor the feudal or landed in- terest, arrayed against the mercantile and industrious classes, as in some modern states. In these last instances, there were permanent grounds of difference, arising fron opposing interests. Cur differences on the contrary have been mere differen- ces of opinion upon questions of govern ment, and on its public measures The rich and the poor, the learned, and the un- learned. the powerful and the feeble, were found on both sides of the question.

S.-There Is a very important opening on board American and English vessels at Smyrma for the distribution of fEngish Tracts. The few we had with us, have proved very acceptable, and we have had repeated sOli- citations fir more. Thus far, we have every Sabbath held a meeting on board some yes sel. Our congregation, Sabbath before last, on board the AmeFican slOOp of war OntariO, consisted of 275 men.\n\n X A public meeting of the citizens or DOS ton, friendly to the National and ot1te Administrations was held at Faneuil Hall on the evening of the 20th inst. A res\"- lution was offered and adopted expressing the determination of the meeting to sup port by all fair and honorable means the present Nationaland State Administration. It was further resolved, that it IS expedi- ent that the city of Boston should be rep rese ented in the General Court by such men as will consult the great interest of the State and nation, regardless of all party distinction and local prejudices and nu- merous committee was appointed [\" select a list of candidates and report the same to an adjourned meeting. Several gentle\n\n men addressed the meeting on the ocoa- sion, and among others the Hon. DANIEL.\n\n WEBSTER, in the following speech: as\n\n Spscch cf Mr. Webster, at the meeting\n\n in Faneuil- Hal, on Friday evening last\n\n -as reported for the Daily Advertiser. MT. Webster said, that there were ma ny and obvious reasons, why he might have wished to fobear taking any part in the proceedings of this meeting. Never, theless as the object of it was one which he entirely approved, he felt it his duty to express that appreciation, aud to take\n\n his part in the responsibility belonging | to the occasion. Notwithstanding the | odium which some attempted to attach to\n\n what they are pleased to call amalgama- l ton, he entertained the belief that the l time had come, when it was important, and | indeed indispensable, for those who enter\n\n tain similar opinions, and sought to pro- ] mote similar objects, to act with united council. and united force. The resolutions\n\n which have been read, by his friend in the gallery Mr. Child, expressed the opin- ion that it was expedient for those who ap- prove the general course of the govern ment, to unite, without reference to for- mer party, in the election of members to the legislature, favorable to that govern ment, and inclined to give it a sincere and hearty support. As bearing on this ques- ton, it might be proper to look cn the ac- tual state of things.\n\n The last President, Mir. Monroe, had been elected for his second term of office by a vote almost, or entirely unanimous.\n\n The course of his administration, gener- ally speaking, was satisfactory and accept- able. But with this gentleman he list of candidates, for the office of president, whose claims rested on revolutionary mer- its and services, terminated. An election was next to be. made, from a new genera ton of men; and that happened, which was quite natural, and should surprise no one, that several candidates were proposed and supported by their friends. The east and the west, the north and the south, put forth their respective favorites. In conn- try so extensive, it need be no cause of wonder, when the class of revolutionary patriots was gone, that opinions should not uuttC duy OuS SoHuiuhtC3 OI cVcU Ut UI~ vided between any two candidates for the l highest office. We had no Caesars to be- stride the land like colossus. Our Rome encompassed many men, distinguished for talents and services, and who in the cir- cies where they were best known, were respectively deemed worthy of the highest honours. In this state of things, the late election came on, and no candidates re- ceived a majority of all the votes. The ultimate election of course devolved on the 1 House of Representatives, and the choice fell on distinguished citizen of this Com- monwealth. Bnt ere he was entered on bis office, a thorough and determined opposition was commenced. It did not wait to guide his judgment by the meas .ure of the new administration, but found- ed itself entirely on the choice that had been made, and complaining only that an- other choice had n, t been made, it seemed disposed, not to allow men the common privilige of standing or falling according to the merits of their conduct For his own part, he had no hesitation to say, that he looked upon such principal of opposition, as dangerous to the very being of govern ment. It must sometimes, and may often happen that majority of the electors, do hsvatr svS h. -E n",

Its situation is central, aud On the highest land. Here we found nothing of the noisy hustle of Valttta. No mirthful thrOng of playful children enIivened the streets. 1t was the silence of midnight. It is the unso- cial, dreary abode of Monks and Nuns. Here, through the double grating of their dark and gloomy rccesses we saw these delllded se- questered females. It was heart-sickenlllg sight. How far from the precepts of that a. posfle, whom Publius once, in this very city, lodged three days cOurteously, and to whose name spleudid churches are here now dedica- ted, and costly monuments erected. St. Paurs Cathedral, according to tradition, Oc- cupies the very spot where Publins lived. 1t is a more beautiful, but less expensive edi. fee than the church of St. Joha's. Its paint ings surpass all have eyer seen; among the most splendid of which, is the shipwreck Of the Apostle.\n\n Near Citta Vecchia is the entrance of the Catacombs. These are artificial, subterrane v an excavations ia the solid rock. Passages just sufficient to admit a single person, are carried in many different directions and tO great distances. They are said to extend in one direction two miles; and in another sev en. As many according to report, have here lost their way and perished, the entrances are now closed up. They open on each side, at short intervals into what appear to have been the abodes of men. Que, far more spacious the rest, not imprubably was chapel. We saw also parts of what one were mills for grin ding corn. We examined also a number of large well formed ovens. There are ma ny sepulchres and inches cut in the wall. In some of these inches single body only was laid in others whole family appear to have been deposited side by side ;-sOme of the scpulchres being those of full grown persons, and others those of infants.\n\n Besides the two cities, there are, in the Va rious parts ofthe Island, twenty or thirty vil-\n\n \n\n and all of them are we'll furnished with churches.

The priest and the people had gore down to the grave.\n\n This Deserted Village is fit emblem off the moral dcsoation, which still overspread the Island. Popery is to the soul what the pestilence is to the body.-it impovishes--de- grades-destroys. There is no calculating the sums it lavishes upon sacred edfces. idle Nuns. and crowds of lazy Priests. 1t has ex- torted untold treasures, poured it into the church, turned thousand peennyless on the world.a d crowded every street with beggars.\n\n 1t denies access to the foundation of all knowledge.

And was it any more wise in us, because we have differed on those topics, to resolve, that we would not now unite, in a regard to those objects, in respect to which our sentiments, our wish eS, and our hopes were the same. 1t was quite obvious to him, that the admin istration could only be supported on its own principles. When the President came into office he stated frankly and honestly that in his opinion, sacrifice of party feeling, and party prejudice was to be made. His sentiments had been full, and emph atic, st.ing out upon this basis, how could.it be said that the administra- ; ton was supported by those, who, while they professed friendship for it, denounced and prescribed others, who felt as much friend- ship for it as themselves. For his own part he thought it no want of charity to distrist such pretensions. How was It to be expected of men, who had no more in- terest than others in the matter, that they would be willing to breast the Opposition with which the administration was assail- ed if at the same time they and their friends were 10 be held out as objects of distrust and jealousy, and made the subjects of a narrow, selfish and exclusive policy? Had we not seen enough the result of such course In alluding to the inaugural sen- timents of the President, he did not mean to say, that they were any other than might have been expected, from either of the other candidates. Most of of them, if not all, he believed, had expressed similar sen- timents. Certainly the distinguished cite izen, who is candidate in opposition, had expressed such sentiments.-They were the necessary result of events. Differing in many other things, all parties had a. greed, in welcoming the peace 1915. The French revolution with all the sympathies and its antiquities, was then at an end. { Our own foreign relations were amicably adjusted, and the alien of party was con- sumed. So apparent was this, that he re- collected to have heard gentleman equal- ly distinguished for quick perception and forcible expression, say, at the moment of the peace, to the manner in which corpo- ration are sometimes dissolved, each of the two parties will now break its common seal. '\n\n 1t was said to be lawful to learnsfrom an enemy, and the admonition m ght be aP- plicable to the present subject. If Mr.. Chairman were to imagine two leading gentleman in the opposition, to be confer . ing in Washington on the mode of sO intiu- encing the course oftwo different states, ,as to bring them to the parties of the oppo- sition; if he should suppose then, to sug- gest to one of these States, having the ma jority ofone political party, that it was im- possible for the present administration ever to treat that party with kindness or re- spect, and by the same post to urge in the other state, a dangerous partiality on the party, and press the necessity of crushing both it, and the administration together if he said, Mr. Chairman were to imagine such an occurance, he doubted whether his fancy would very much outrun the facts. 1t was notorious indeed, that this sort of topics was not used according to the lati- tude and longitude of the place where wan- ted. When it was thought peter by those who are opposed to the administration, to preserve party distinctions, they were pre- serued, and they are disregarded when it is better for the promotion of their own ob- jects, to disregard them.\n\n In this state of things he did not know, what benefit was proposed, by those who were friends to the administration, by dis union and division. They who had cleo ted the present President, if they remain united and firm, were capable of sustain ing him, and maintaining him in all just measures. But nothing short of 6rlnness and union could accomplish this object. The case was not one to be trifed with.\n\n Mir. w. said that he wholly abstained from any local subjects with which the en- suing election might be connected and he purposely forbore, also, from any re- marks on particular measures of the gen- eral government although there were one or two of these measures, on which it might naturally be supposed he should he desrous of saying something to his fellow citizens.-Iie concluded by saying, that in any effort necessary to maintain the ad- ministratisn against the undeserved oppo- sition, to uphold the government and car ry on wise measures for the improvement",
