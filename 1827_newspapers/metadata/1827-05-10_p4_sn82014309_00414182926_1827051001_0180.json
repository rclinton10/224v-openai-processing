Their examples, like their laws, were Sal- utary. Christianity and knQwledge were the pillars on which they endeavored ts erect the mighty fabric of great empire. These they guarded with veStal care. Without these a Republic cannot long ex- ist, and nothing sooner or more effectually undermines their foundation than intem- perance. Where this foe finds unressted admission into any country, its destruction is approaching rapidly, and intestine divis-, ion or external concussion will scarcely be needed to complete its ruin.\n\n That untiring watchfulnesS against this enemy of all that is desirable in an individ- ual or community, which characterized the first ages of our country, has gradually re- faxed, till almost every vestage is ettaced, And even the wholesome regulations they enisin, are rendered, by prevailing cus- toms, and public opinion, little more tn an. a dead letter. A comparison between the present and the earlier ages of our coun- try as to the temperance of its inhabitants, affords melancholy contrast. Then the introduction into town of '' whole bar rel of spirits\" reused the people and the magistrates. Now the importation of hundreds of cargoes and the domestic dis tillations ofabout million of barrels, ,caus- es no alarm. Twenty years ago there were in this country thirty thousand dis tilleries.* If they have since multiplied in ratio equal to the increase of popula- ton, which supposition is probably short of the fact, there are now at least fifteen hundred thousand of these sources of mis- cry and death. The aggregate quantity of spurious liquors used annually in this country is about forty millions of gallons, one fifth of which is imported.t Such vast consumption of ardent liquors cannot but effect the national health. For they create disease and diminish sensoral pow ert or muscular energy. And children u- sually inherit at least in a measure the mal adies and diseases of their parents. The offspring of feeble and enervated parents do not possess the robust health and cor- porial vigor of those descended from pa- rents who are temperate and healthy. How often do we hear the remark that young persons of the present age are not so ath letic and healthy as their forefathers, 1 be- live the truth of this observation is gener- ally, credited. l have never known any attempt to disprove-it. A gentleman of accurate observation, of excellent sense, institutions, who had enjoyed distinguish ed opportunities for judging, informed the writer that those from country where the | the high duties on distilled spirits nearly 1 prohibited the use of them to vast major ity of its population were capable of per- forming more labour on public work 1 where they were employed; and could longer endure muscular exertion than the Americans associated with them. We are compelled to admit this general fact, how ever humbling it may be to our national pride. If the youth of the present age have as much strength and health and as fair prospect of longevity as their ances- tors, let the fact be shown, and let others with ourselves have the satisfaction of be- lieving it. If otherwise, let the cause which is producing deterioration of the public health be ascertained and removed. That cause is MATHEMATICIAN twelve hundred thousand barrels of ardent spirits be drank every year without inJurlng the nations health It is impossible. Such an unnatual use of inebriating liquors must impair public health as well as public mor- als. Such thoughtless and ruinous pro- fusion must inevitably induce not only a dimunition of national health, but ope- rate on multitudes as remote or proxim- ate cause of premature death. It has been ascertaned from the registers of tho friends, that, as a consequence of their temperance one half of those that are born live at the l age of forty-seven years whereas Dr. Pierce tells us that the general population of London die under the age of three years.'s \"The number oflives annually destroyed by this vice in our country is thought to be more than ten thousand, and the number ofpersons who are diseased, distressed and impovished by it to be mores than two hundred thousand\" \"One half tho male population of the United States are supposed by sound and accurate judges to die from disease induced by spurious liquors and this alarming state of things is increasingly\n\n That our country appears to be pros- porous is beyond doubt. But many tree a.D. L",

But when we reached Rangoon\n\n almost the first intelligence is ****#\"***\"\"\n\n *****Oh, how shall I tell you my dear\n\n sister that our dear Mrs. Judson is no\n\n more !!-that she died in strange place, l far, far, from all those who would have felt 1 it their greatest consolation to have\n\n watched her sickness. I feel my heart too deeply affected by this dark dispensa-\n\n ton to dwell upon the irreparable loss we have sustained but your afectionate\n\n heart will suggest all. The melancholy\n\n intelligence has been sent to Dr. Judson,\n\n at Ava: but it is not probable that he will\n\n be able to return in month. My heart\n\n bleeds to think what he will suffer. But\n\n why should I indulge so excessive grief, or\n\n be unreconciled to the will of God2 Tru- ly her worth demands our tears i: but the great Head of the Church can accomplish his wise designs without the aid of mortals and I we'll know, that though He should call aU his most valuable and devoted ser wants home, yet He will spread his glorious gospel through all the nations of this fallen. world. We very deeply regret that we had not been at Amherst from the time of Dr.. Judson's departure for Ava :; but we followed his advice, in waiting in Bengal until he should visit Amherst the second time. After we received his letter, advis- ing us to proceed to Amherst, we sailed in the first ship, with the exception of one which was not considered safe, and which was indeed lost on her wap to Rangoon. All the particulars we have been able to obtain here, are that our dear Sister was i'll of a slow fever about month, and died on the 24th or 18th of October.\n\n She received every kind attention from a skilful Physician, and enjoyed the society of two European ladies, one of whom has the care of her little daughter at present. The Physician says, that long before he thought her case at all a. farming, he could not prevail upon her to think she should recover and that she l was constantly talking about death. We expect to proceed to Amherst in few days 1 when | hope to be able to give more par ticulars but we find it so very difficult and ! expensive to get passage, but we intend | to proceed in very small vessel, we fear 1 \"AAA AAos M ONAS \" PAOeCSt uo uOLA SHC prates, who have been very troublesome l here oflate. But duty appears plain, and l after we have taken every prudent pre- caution for our safety, should we fear that He who has preserved us by what seemed l a miracle, will now forsake us No, my sister, we do not fear, because we know that the great Shepherd of Israel never. siumbers or sleeps, and that our lives are the care of kind, unerring Providence. l We also know, by happy experience, that our Heavenly Father can support and cheer us in great extremities: and if he should by any Providence see fit to call us home.-Oh how will that soul be, when It shall like our departed sister, have ex- changed this \" vale of tears'' for the pure ]oys which proceed from the throne of\n\n Uod and the Lamb. I have been enabled 10 anticipate those joys with particular de- l'gnt since our late affective bereavement;\n\n end ardently desire that all may be sancti- ned to prepare me for the duties of life.-\n\n Sister Boardman has, no doubt, informed\n\n you of the circumstances which prevented\n\n 'heir sailing from Bengal ; and after living\n\n SO happily with them for ten months, you\n\n will not be surprised to hear me say that",

I hope to be able to commence a Burman female School soon after our arrival in Amherst. We both enjoy excellent health at present, and desire nothing so much as as be settled where we may be use- full\"\n\n We learn further, by the Rev. MT. Yates, that in the Church at Calcutta, of which he is pastor, 30 were added in the last year. His place is supplied for the present by two brethren in the ministry from England, occasional labours of the Rev. MT. Boardman who with Mrs. Board- man is still in Calcutta. MT. and Mrs. Hough are also in this city.\n\n A short time before Mr. Yates left Call cutta, he had the pleasure of seeing the venerable Dr. Carey, who enjoyed un- common health, and who was able to per- form his accustomed labours, and to preach with great acceptance. The college at Serampore was in a prosperous state.\n\n There are m the city of flCalcutta, in- cluding the church at Fort William, seven protestant churches :; 4 of the English es- tablishment, two of the Baptist denomina- ton, and one of Presbyterians.\n\n The circulation of the Bible in India, and the increasing means of literary and religious information are operating, though silently, a most wonderful moral renova- ton in that extensive country. The uni form influence of literature and science is, the destruction of idolatry, even where Christian religion is not embraced. One instance not long since in which Hindoo of large property, the owner of an idol temple, removed the abomination from the buildiug-destroying the idol, and de- molishing the ,emple,-The circumstance produced in the vicinity great excite ment. .,.\n\n The Hindoo College in Calcutta, who'll ly supported by the natives, is indirectly doing much good, by scattering informa- ton. Its number of students is believed to exceed 200 and although the princi- ples of Christianity are not acknowledged l the literature and science which this estab- lishment teaches are favorable to civiliza- ton, and calculated to bring idolatry into the most perfect contempt.-ChristiaR W0tcansdn.",

            "article": "9tFstFWSstp\n\n ELY of BIfaiO county, \". Y.\n\n Temperance was an eminent virtue m the character of those heroic men who laId the foundation of our country's greatness. Their examples, like their laws, were Sal- utary. Christianity and knQwledge were the pillars on which they endeavored ts erect the mighty fabric of great empire. These they guarded with veStal care. Without these a Republic cannot long ex- ist, and nothing sooner or more effectually undermines their foundation than intem- perance. Where this foe finds unressted admission into any country, its destruction is approaching rapidly, and intestine divis-, ion or external concussion will scarcely be needed to complete its ruin.\n\n That untiring watchfulnesS against this enemy of all that is desirable in an individ- ual or community, which characterized the first ages of our country, has gradually re- faxed, till almost every vestage is ettaced, And even the wholesome regulations they enisin, are rendered, by prevailing cus- toms, and public opinion, little more tn an. a dead letter. A comparison between the present and the earlier ages of our coun- try as to the temperance of its inhabitants, affords melancholy contrast. Then the introduction into town of '' whole bar rel of spirits\" reused the people and the magistrates. Now the importation of hundreds of cargoes and the domestic dis tillations ofabout million of barrels, ,caus- es no alarm. Twenty years ago there were in this country thirty thousand dis tilleries.* If they have since multiplied in ratio equal to the increase of popula- ton, which supposition is probably short of the fact, there are now at least fifteen hundred thousand of these sources of mis- cry and death. The aggregate quantity of spurious liquors used annually in this country is about forty millions of gallons, one fifth of which is imported.t Such vast consumption of ardent liquors cannot but effect the national health. For they create disease and diminish sensoral pow ert or muscular energy. And children u- sually inherit at least in a measure the mal adies and diseases of their parents. The offspring of feeble and enervated parents do not possess the robust health and cor- porial vigor of those descended from pa- rents who are temperate and healthy. How often do we hear the remark that young persons of the present age are not so ath letic and healthy as their forefathers, 1 be- live the truth of this observation is gener- ally, credited. l have never known any attempt to disprove-it. A gentleman of accurate observation, of excellent sense, institutions, who had enjoyed distinguish ed opportunities for judging, informed the writer that those from country where the | the high duties on distilled spirits nearly 1 prohibited the use of them to vast major ity of its population were capable of per- forming more labour on public work 1 where they were employed; and could longer endure muscular exertion than the Americans associated with them. We are compelled to admit this general fact, how ever humbling it may be to our national pride. If the youth of the present age have as much strength and health and as fair prospect of longevity as their ances- tors, let the fact be shown, and let others with ourselves have the satisfaction of be- lieving it. If otherwise, let the cause which is producing deterioration of the public health be ascertained and removed. That cause is MATHEMATICIAN twelve hundred thousand barrels of ardent spirits be drank every year without inJurlng the nations health It is impossible. Such an unnatual use of inebriating liquors must impair public health as well as public mor- als. Such thoughtless and ruinous pro- fusion must inevitably induce not only a dimunition of national health, but ope- rate on multitudes as remote or proxim- ate cause of premature death. It has been ascertaned from the registers of tho friends, that, as a consequence of their temperance one half of those that are born live at the l age of forty-seven years whereas Dr. Pierce tells us that the general population of London die under the age of three years.'s \"The number oflives annually destroyed by this vice in our country is thought to be more than ten thousand, and the number ofpersons who are diseased, distressed and impovished by it to be mores than two hundred thousand\" \"One half tho male population of the United States are supposed by sound and accurate judges to die from disease induced by spurious liquors and this alarming state of things is increasingly\n\n That our country appears to be pros- porous is beyond doubt. But many tree a.D. L",

            "article": "ton, from Calcutta, Capt. Titcomb, 1Ol\n\n days from Sand Heads, we have the dis ] tressing intelligence of the death of Mrs.\n\n Judson. The Rev. M. Yates, of English ! Baptist Mission at Calcutta, who came\n\n passenger in the Mars, is the bearer of\n\n letters giving this information. He is on\n\n visit to our shores for the recovery of his\n\n health much impaired by repeated attacks\n\n of fever.\n\n The following is an extract of letter to\n\n lady in Boston, from Mrs. Wade, now in Rangoon with Mir. Wade, both of the American Mission to BurmAh. RANGooN, Nov. IA, 1926. Wy Uery dear Mrs. S.-Our last letters informed you that we were sailing for Am l herst by way of Rangoon where we arrived on the 9th of this month, after long, and\n\n in some respects very unpleasant passage. From letter which received from Mrs.\n\n Jndson just before we left Bengal, we | learned that she was n,nch pleased with\n\n the new station, and the prospect of\n\n hene for life. We were unusually cheer- ] ful and happy during our voyage, in the prospect of finding at last little peaceful\n\n spot, where we might devote our few re-\n\n maining days more directly to the great object flor which we came to this\n\n country. But when we reached Rangoon\n\n almost the first intelligence is ****#\"***\"\"\n\n *****Oh, how shall I tell you my dear\n\n sister that our dear Mrs. Judson is no\n\n more !!-that she died in strange place, l far, far, from all those who would have felt 1 it their greatest consolation to have\n\n watched her sickness. I feel my heart too deeply affected by this dark dispensa-\n\n ton to dwell upon the irreparable loss we have sustained but your afectionate\n\n heart will suggest all. The melancholy\n\n intelligence has been sent to Dr. Judson,\n\n at Ava: but it is not probable that he will\n\n be able to return in month. My heart\n\n bleeds to think what he will suffer. But\n\n why should I indulge so excessive grief, or\n\n be unreconciled to the will of God2 Tru- ly her worth demands our tears i: but the great Head of the Church can accomplish his wise designs without the aid of mortals and I we'll know, that though He should call aU his most valuable and devoted ser wants home, yet He will spread his glorious gospel through all the nations of this fallen. world. We very deeply regret that we had not been at Amherst from the time of Dr.. Judson's departure for Ava :; but we followed his advice, in waiting in Bengal until he should visit Amherst the second time. After we received his letter, advis- ing us to proceed to Amherst, we sailed in the first ship, with the exception of one which was not considered safe, and which was indeed lost on her wap to Rangoon. All the particulars we have been able to obtain here, are that our dear Sister was i'll of a slow fever about month, and died on the 24th or 18th of October.\n\n She received every kind attention from a skilful Physician, and enjoyed the society of two European ladies, one of whom has the care of her little daughter at present. The Physician says, that long before he thought her case at all a. farming, he could not prevail upon her to think she should recover and that she l was constantly talking about death. We expect to proceed to Amherst in few days 1 when | hope to be able to give more par ticulars but we find it so very difficult and ! expensive to get passage, but we intend | to proceed in very small vessel, we fear 1 \"AAA AAos M ONAS \" PAOeCSt uo uOLA SHC prates, who have been very troublesome l here oflate. But duty appears plain, and l after we have taken every prudent pre- caution for our safety, should we fear that He who has preserved us by what seemed l a miracle, will now forsake us No, my sister, we do not fear, because we know that the great Shepherd of Israel never. siumbers or sleeps, and that our lives are the care of kind, unerring Providence. l We also know, by happy experience, that our Heavenly Father can support and cheer us in great extremities: and if he should by any Providence see fit to call us home.-Oh how will that soul be, when It shall like our departed sister, have ex- changed this \" vale of tears'' for the pure ]oys which proceed from the throne of\n\n Uod and the Lamb. I have been enabled 10 anticipate those joys with particular de- l'gnt since our late affective bereavement;\n\n end ardently desire that all may be sancti- ned to prepare me for the duties of life.-\n\n Sister Boardman has, no doubt, informed\n\n you of the circumstances which prevented\n\n 'heir sailing from Bengal ; and after living\n\n SO happily with them for ten months, you\n\n will not be surprised to hear me say that",
