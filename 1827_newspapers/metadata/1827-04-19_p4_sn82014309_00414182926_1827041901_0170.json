The Lord is carrying on his own work. 1t IS now about four weeks since the revlVal commenced. We have had three Inquiry Meetings. At the first there were 30 In- uuirers,-at the second 1OO,-at the third 400: besides 15O who were rejoicing ln hope. Opposition is not known. Every man stands in astonishment x says, \" It IS the work of God\" Some of cur boldest sinners have been converted by strong arm and large portion of our most in- teresting youth are among those who have either submitted, or are convicted. The prayers of Christians are, that 0N may be brought to the feet of Jesus, and feel the redeeming influence of his blood.\n\n There appears to be divine influence on the whole community. Even the air and the face of nature wear solemnlty, and our busy village has the appearance of the Sabbath.-Powerful revivals are at this time experienced in Richmond, Lenox, Lee, Otis, Beckett, Stockbridge, Williams town, and considerable attention in Great Darlington, Sheffield, Egremont, and New Marlborough. Also great attention in New Lebanon, Canaan, and Austerlitz, on the neighboring borders of New York. Sure ly this is good day for the church, for her light is come.\n\n RENTALS IN BERKSHIRE CouNTY.-A clergyman in Berkshire County writes thus to his friend in this city :-\" With respect to the revival in this County, I have only time to say, that it far exceeds whatever has been known here before. Almost the whole County is moved. In Williams town, where the work has just commenced, it is said that almost every individual, both in College and town, is anxious or rejoi- cling. In Pittsfeld, the work is glorious. It was stated at our Sabbath prayer-meet- ing last Lords day, that 18O or more were indulging hope, and that 200 were pres ent at one Inquiry Meeting. In Lenox the number of conversions is about 20 a week. In Lee more than 200 are rejoi- cing in hope. At meeting there last week for young converts, those who dated their hope within the week preceding, were requested to rise: the number who rose was 40. Richmond and Stockbridge compare with Lenox: Sheffield and Egre- mont, with this town; \"a few hoping, few inquiring. In Tyringham and the north part of New Marlborough, the state of re- ligion is very interesting.-In Williams town, Pitts6eld, New Marlborough and Tyringham, the work commenced only four or five weeks since. In Canaan, Green River, Spencertown and New Lebanon, in New York, the revival is not less anima- ting than in this County.-Something ve- ry interesting is apparent in the north part of Litchield County, Conn. A constant intercourse is kept up between the breth- ren by weekly conference, held in rota- tion at the several towns, and attended by delegates from the various churches. In all the towns, have mentioned, except New Lebanon, these conferences have been held ;-and in several more. A great bles- 'fing has invariabiy followed.\n\n RENTALS IN GEoRGIA.-A gentleman of responsibility, who has just arrived in this city from Athens, Geo. states that the revival in the College at that place, has re- suited in the hopeful conversion of about 90 students many of whom are from the most respectable families in the State, and some sustain high rank as scholars. This revival has already been noticed as exten- ding to Millegeville, and to the Legislature there assembled. Our informant states that four representatives from one County give evidence of true conversion and that two or three of them have united with the church. A work of grace appears to have commenced in Augusta, St. Mary's, Lib- erty County, and Savannah.\n\n LEBANON, CoNN.-A letter from gen. tleman in Lebanon, Conn. to a person in this city, dated April 1st 1927, says, |\" We have revival of religion here which com menced the first of January. The number of converts is more than thirty principal lyyouth. .\"-I6.\n\n REVIVAL IN PsRTLAND.-By a letter from pious individual in Portland, Me. dated March 29th, 1927, it appears that an interesting work of grace is going forward in that place, among the Congregational. ists. Baptists and Methodists. The num- Der now inquiring what they must do to be saved, the writer states to be not less than 500: and more than 100 indulge hope that their sins are washed away in the ato- ming blood of Jesus. The work appears to be thorough, and is advancing. Happy 1NRNUH af hn As",

            "article": "E tLESIcNGS L1SSSS' \" t'\" 7 SS''NS wv wv\n\n d0ted M1Tch 30, 1927.\n\n The Lord is with us, of truth. Such a time in PttS6eld was never known. The Lord is carrying on his own work. 1t IS now about four weeks since the revlVal commenced. We have had three Inquiry Meetings. At the first there were 30 In- uuirers,-at the second 1OO,-at the third 400: besides 15O who were rejoicing ln hope. Opposition is not known. Every man stands in astonishment x says, \" It IS the work of God\" Some of cur boldest sinners have been converted by strong arm and large portion of our most in- teresting youth are among those who have either submitted, or are convicted. The prayers of Christians are, that 0N may be brought to the feet of Jesus, and feel the redeeming influence of his blood.\n\n There appears to be divine influence on the whole community. Even the air and the face of nature wear solemnlty, and our busy village has the appearance of the Sabbath.-Powerful revivals are at this time experienced in Richmond, Lenox, Lee, Otis, Beckett, Stockbridge, Williams town, and considerable attention in Great Darlington, Sheffield, Egremont, and New Marlborough. Also great attention in New Lebanon, Canaan, and Austerlitz, on the neighboring borders of New York. Sure ly this is good day for the church, for her light is come.\n\n RENTALS IN BERKSHIRE CouNTY.-A clergyman in Berkshire County writes thus to his friend in this city :-\" With respect to the revival in this County, I have only time to say, that it far exceeds whatever has been known here before. Almost the whole County is moved. In Williams town, where the work has just commenced, it is said that almost every individual, both in College and town, is anxious or rejoi- cling. In Pittsfeld, the work is glorious. It was stated at our Sabbath prayer-meet- ing last Lords day, that 18O or more were indulging hope, and that 200 were pres ent at one Inquiry Meeting. In Lenox the number of conversions is about 20 a week. In Lee more than 200 are rejoi- cing in hope. At meeting there last week for young converts, those who dated their hope within the week preceding, were requested to rise: the number who rose was 40. Richmond and Stockbridge compare with Lenox: Sheffield and Egre- mont, with this town; \"a few hoping, few inquiring. In Tyringham and the north part of New Marlborough, the state of re- ligion is very interesting.-In Williams town, Pitts6eld, New Marlborough and Tyringham, the work commenced only four or five weeks since. In Canaan, Green River, Spencertown and New Lebanon, in New York, the revival is not less anima- ting than in this County.-Something ve- ry interesting is apparent in the north part of Litchield County, Conn. A constant intercourse is kept up between the breth- ren by weekly conference, held in rota- tion at the several towns, and attended by delegates from the various churches. In all the towns, have mentioned, except New Lebanon, these conferences have been held ;-and in several more. A great bles- 'fing has invariabiy followed.\n\n RENTALS IN GEoRGIA.-A gentleman of responsibility, who has just arrived in this city from Athens, Geo. states that the revival in the College at that place, has re- suited in the hopeful conversion of about 90 students many of whom are from the most respectable families in the State, and some sustain high rank as scholars. This revival has already been noticed as exten- ding to Millegeville, and to the Legislature there assembled. Our informant states that four representatives from one County give evidence of true conversion and that two or three of them have united with the church. A work of grace appears to have commenced in Augusta, St. Mary's, Lib- erty County, and Savannah.\n\n LEBANON, CoNN.-A letter from gen. tleman in Lebanon, Conn. to a person in this city, dated April 1st 1927, says, |\" We have revival of religion here which com menced the first of January. The number of converts is more than thirty principal lyyouth. .\"-I6.\n\n REVIVAL IN PsRTLAND.-By a letter from pious individual in Portland, Me. dated March 29th, 1927, it appears that an interesting work of grace is going forward in that place, among the Congregational. ists. Baptists and Methodists. The num- Der now inquiring what they must do to be saved, the writer states to be not less than 500: and more than 100 indulge hope that their sins are washed away in the ato- ming blood of Jesus. The work appears to be thorough, and is advancing. Happy 1NRNUH af hn As",
