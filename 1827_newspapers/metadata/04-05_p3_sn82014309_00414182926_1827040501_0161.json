In this town there was no noise, no contention, obsolete political distinctions were almost universally forgotten, and calm iy and deliberately the freemen went to the polls, and the result is shown in the returns of the votes. We most heartily congratulate our republican friends in this triumphant expres- sion of the popular will in favor of correct prin- ciples. In virtuous community it is only ne- cessary for the people to be awake to their rights in order to defend and maintain them : it is only necessary for them faithfully and honestly to attend to their elective duties, to secure the services of the best men for the va rious offices in the gift of the state.

Tomlinson. All classes\n\n would have been gratiied in supporting him\n\n for Congress, where his talents shone conspi- cuously, and where his worth was universally acknowledged. But it did not please the \"pohtical dictators\" to continue him in that station; David Plant, as reward for his un- governable zeal, must fill that station; and to bring this about, Gov. Wolcott must be uncer- cmoniousiy put aside, Mir. Tomlinson, who was too much beloved by the people to be sacrificed, must be put in his stead, and then the course was clear for the It. Governor. If the people throughout the state have not sanctioned this change, Mr. Plant must blame his own head for having devised so unpopu- lar a measure and if Mfr. Tomlinson, with out his consent or knowledge, has been cast out of office through the interference of a knot of medling politicians, he will have the consciousness of knowing that his fellow citizens hold his character and services in just estimation, and will hereafter so manifest it by bestowng upon him the highest office in the gift of the people. The representatives chosen for this town, are men whom all can did persons approve. But three candidates were brought forward, and the contention re- lative to their support arose more from local, than from political, prejudicess The result of the election, and careful observation, support us In this assertion. We did not hear of any organized measures to secure, or defeat, the election of any candidate there was no cau cussing, no intriguing, but good feeling and moderation appeared to pervade the great majority of the electors. This single fact proves that caucusses & cabals are unnecessary in concentrating tue votes of intelligent cleo tors upon honest and capable men. We hope to be able in our next paper to give such view of the votes throughout the state as will show whether the people were as much awake to their duty in other counties as they appear to have been in this, and whether from this election we may date new era in the triumph and preponderance of republican principles.\n\n NOTICE.-The inhabitants of this village and of the town generally, are invited to meet at the West School House, on Thursday eve ming, the 18th inst. to devise means for the enlargement of the building now occupied by the Female Academy, or for erecting a new house. The importance of this measure is universally acknowledged. The Female\n\n School is a source of wealth to the town, as we'll as an honor to its literary character; but at present there is no lecture room connected with the establishment. This evil should be remedied by an addition to the present buil- ding, or the erection of new house. Efforts have been made to procure MT Brace, the principal of this school, as a professor in\n\n very respectable college; and those talents for featuring, with which he is richly gifted, ought not, and we trust will not, be lost upon our community, for the want suitable room.

In climate so variable as ours, where the changes of the weather are frequently sudden and unexpected, it requires more care and attention to guard against this dangerous enemy of life, than most people imagine, or are able and willing to bestow. The bills of mortality exhibit the melancholy fact that the proportion of deaths by this disease may be C, nsidered as about five to one Inasmuch then as this fatal disease bids defiance to the skill of the most learned physicians, it is a grat'Ecation to the proprietor that he is ena- bIed to offer to those afflicted with it a good ly prospect of relief in that highly valuable remedy the Vegetable Indian Specifc.-The Indians are happy in their knowledge of med ical plants; governed wholly by eA; erience, they are certain as to their effect, and it is said by an author of great character, that true conusmption is disease never known among them.\n\n For the information of those afflicted with complaints of the breast and lungs the pro- prietor inserts (from among the numerous tes- timonials in his possession) the following cer- tifcate:\n\n Baltimore, 7th Dec. 1924.\n\n I, w.

The feeling so strong\n\n ly manifested in this town in relation to the votes for Governor, were mostly excited on account of the corrupt course pursued by the caucus last spring; and not from any person.\n\n al objection to Mir. Tomlinson. All classes\n\n would have been gratiied in supporting him\n\n for Congress, where his talents shone conspi- cuously, and where his worth was universally acknowledged. But it did not please the \"pohtical dictators\" to continue him in that station; David Plant, as reward for his un- governable zeal, must fill that station; and to bring this about, Gov. Wolcott must be uncer- cmoniousiy put aside, Mir. Tomlinson, who was too much beloved by the people to be sacrificed, must be put in his stead, and then the course was clear for the It. Governor. If the people throughout the state have not sanctioned this change, Mr. Plant must blame his own head for having devised so unpopu- lar a measure and if Mfr. Tomlinson, with out his consent or knowledge, has been cast out of office through the interference of a knot of medling politicians, he will have the consciousness of knowing that his fellow citizens hold his character and services in just estimation, and will hereafter so manifest it by bestowng upon him the highest office in the gift of the people. The representatives chosen for this town, are men whom all can did persons approve. But three candidates were brought forward, and the contention re- lative to their support arose more from local, than from political, prejudicess The result of the election, and careful observation, support us In this assertion. We did not hear of any organized measures to secure, or defeat, the election of any candidate there was no cau cussing, no intriguing, but good feeling and moderation appeared to pervade the great majority of the electors. This single fact proves that caucusses & cabals are unnecessary in concentrating tue votes of intelligent cleo tors upon honest and capable men. We hope to be able in our next paper to give such view of the votes throughout the state as will show whether the people were as much awake to their duty in other counties as they appear to have been in this, and whether from this election we may date new era in the triumph and preponderance of republican principles.\n\n NOTICE.-The inhabitants of this village and of the town generally, are invited to meet at the West School House, on Thursday eve ming, the 18th inst. to devise means for the enlargement of the building now occupied by the Female Academy, or for erecting a new house. The importance of this measure is universally acknowledged. The Female\n\n School is a source of wealth to the town, as we'll as an honor to its literary character; but at present there is no lecture room connected with the establishment. This evil should be remedied by an addition to the present buil- ding, or the erection of new house. Efforts have been made to procure MT Brace, the principal of this school, as a professor in\n\n very respectable college; and those talents for featuring, with which he is richly gifted, ought not, and we trust will not, be lost upon our community, for the want suitable room.

In climate so variable as ours, where the changes of the weather are frequently sudden and unexpected, it requires more care and attention to guard against this dangerous enemy of life, than most people imagine, or are able and willing to bestow. The bills of mortality exhibit the melancholy fact that the proportion of deaths by this disease may be C, nsidered as about five to one Inasmuch then as this fatal disease bids defiance to the skill of the most learned physicians, it is a grat'Ecation to the proprietor that he is ena- bIed to offer to those afflicted with it a good ly prospect of relief in that highly valuable remedy the Vegetable Indian Specifc.-The Indians are happy in their knowledge of med ical plants; governed wholly by eA; erience, they are certain as to their effect, and it is said by an author of great character, that true conusmption is disease never known among them.\n\n For the information of those afflicted with complaints of the breast and lungs the pro- prietor inserts (from among the numerous tes- timonials in his possession) the following cer- tifcate:\n\n Baltimore, 7th Dec. 1924.\n\n I, w.
