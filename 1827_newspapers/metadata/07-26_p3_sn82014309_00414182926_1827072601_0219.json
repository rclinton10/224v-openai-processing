It asserted that this armament would be ready on the 18th May, and that Lord Cochrane would then sail for Tenedos, to wait for the Turkish\n\n fleet. Meantime, Capt. Hastings has taken in the | Gulf of Seo, six Turkish vessels laden with amuni- ton, and has burned four others.

Especially this is the fact in Ltchfeld County. We not in the habit of say ing oh relative To ourself but in connexion with the above assertion, which belive to be true, we feel strongly inclined this week saya few wordsup on our own affairs. The have ever taken in relation politics, and especially pending the late state electoneerng campaign, completely in accordance with that pursued by the editor of the Hartford Times, that in instance did he dissent from us or offer one objection expressed opin ions indeed of the offensive articles which appeared in paper,-ofensive to class of poll cians-were extracted from his paper. It is true we accused of commencing the attack upon Legislative caucusses and of taking the lead in the contest but this honor suspect brother Wells will be dis posed to dispute with us. It was not until pol tics calmly settling down for the present year and occasion could be offered for political contro versy that the editor of the Times and his agents in this county recommended an attack upon the republ can character of this paper. To such people as may still feel sort of political horror the name fcde ral beg to be excused for saying that not the value of fig whether we are called federal or democrat; the terms are perfectly indefinite app- ed at the present time, andmean any thing nothlng as suits the convenience of the politician using them is in vain that have called upon the editor ofthe = Il i 4 lcan principles in papcrthe reiterated reply is 'you are an Adams amalgamaton federast.\" .\"-Now with intelligent candid persons, such like indefinite assertions would pass for their real worth, it not for the efforts of certain gentemen who have hereto fore been allowed to exercise some considerable po litical dctation, and who ready to back up such charges with the assertion that the republicans of this county do not support this press approve of the course pursued by it's editor; and that the HART FORD TIMES is the only TRUE republican paper in the state, and the paper of all ohers which THE PAR rY are bound to support. With some few people this argument is unaas,cerabe because the assertions of their political leaders have been questioned ''the good of THE PARTY requiring that they should be be- lieyed and obeyed.\" Although this course has not n- jurcd us it has caused change in the names of our subscribers. Invariably where efforts have been made to stop the circulation of the Post efforts have been made, with equal success, to sustain it, Now if these attacks from the Times, backed up by certain leading politicians in this county, not evil denty owing to national politics, know what fact can be capable of demonstration. Why is the Hart ford Times the only republican paper in the state which accuses of federalism ?-be it remembered, the a,cfI political sin is charged upon Mir. Ad ams and his whole cabinet council, by this republican paragon that at least found in good compa- ny.-Why not these charges preferred against us pending the last state election? Why the prnci pies then advocated so well sustained in ths coun- ty, ifthey were the offspring of political error? Why are leading republican politicians, who known friends the administration, still the supporters ofths press? Why do certain preended friends to the ad- minstration, who think Gen. Jackson very excel lent man, and have objection to try him o,ce as President of the United States\" choose the Times as substitute for this paper ins toad of the Register Mercury, old republican papers, and firmly atachedto Mr. Adams? If streams show which way the tide sets, facts stubborn these show incontestiby that the efforts which the editor of the Times, and few ndi- vduals in this county making to destroy this press originate solely account of national instead of state politics; and that it is not the federalism of this paper which ofends them-but it's opposition to the faction which would elevate Gen. Jackson and his satellites the moral virtue and political liberty the coun- try. Let the freemen look to it--let them learn the motives of their enticers before they are induced to look to the Hartford Times alone for knowledge of political events. Letthem be prepared to discard from the councils of country the greatest and the best men in land, if they determined to believe in the political rcctitude of that paper Let them be pre- pared to reject internal improvements. encouragement to domestic industry, ,and yield implicit submission to Virginia dctatioD, if they prepared reject political herecs all whom the puere editor of the Hartford Times sees fit to prescribe. We shall not suffer by this course, however unwilling we maybe to see individuals under the garb offrcndship labourng assduously support the measures of the open enc. my-individuals who ready to plead their preten- sions of friendship should Mr. Adams again succeed in election, their acts should Gen.

The Manda- rins took the pass boat and towing her towards the Chinese vessel of war-when the Americans and English manned their boats and went in pursuit. In about half an hour the foremost boat came up with them---muskets were fired and stones were thrown from the Mandarin boats but other boats coming up, they began attack and succeeded in re-taking the pass boat and orders, and proceeded to the Ct- zen. heard on the 2d that two yiandarines were killed and two Chinese were wounded. There are three four Chinese vessels of lying here now, and there are said to be thirty nfore coming down from town, distance sixty miles. We now lie with all our guns double shotted ready for battle. The vessels that here I think more than match for them.

Monroe, then Secretary of War, for the promp- titude with which ho had moved men and munitions | for its defence &c.--Gen. Jackson was informed of the remark, took offence at the terms in which this was expressed by Mir. $. and sent him angry note thereupon by friend, perhaps by Gen. Eaton. To this note Mir.

As he declined however, he would avail himself of the Post Office 1 through which he accordingly sent it. Upon receiving this letter Gen. Jackson immediate y wrote again Mr. Southard. It is this last letter which has excited the most remarks. It was shown by Mir. $. to friend two matter of actual cu- rlosity. Some of Gen.

The wounded gentleman is ! f0 hn rni Inv h IS to be very dangerous. The affair conducted with so much secrecy that nothing was known of the par ties till the whole had terminated.\n\n l Pauperism.--Covernor Pumer, of New Hamp- I shire, who Is writing in the Portsmouth Journal, | Tn one of his numbers treats of pauperism. He says \"In some towns the project has been adopted to purchase house and farm, and appoint an agent to supernend the labor of the paupers in cuitvang and improving 1t. In nne times out of ten this mode, n stead of diminishing, increases the expense of supp porting the poor. The eligible and cheapest mode have known for country towns is annually to vendue the board, clothing, and taking care of the poor to the lowest bidder, whom the selectmen con- sder suitable for that purpose This will place the poor of the town in families, where they will be well treated, and where the interest of the dertakers will require the paupers to labor and be in duStrlous, and in some measure support themselves\n\n If we except sickness and old age, all assistance to the poor which does not promote industry IS rather premium to idleness and improVidence, than acts of l be wholesome, but cheap and their clothing plain but sufficient to protect them aganstte nnccmency otthe seasons\"\n\n That distant events strike with more surprise, andy take more entire possession of minds than those \\ which pass almost under eyes, is remark as ancient as it is unqucsonably true. At this time our papers pretty generally occupied in noticing fact l stated in the House of Commons by Mir. Huskisson, that SiAf Ba\"da''na Ha'akerchiss are made in Eng land and exported India. This is curious fact, exhibiting the revolutions of commerce, aud the tri- umohs of skill and ingenuity.

The commencing military trainings with prayer seems to be the revival Of custom long and devoutly cherished by ancestors in primitive times John Dunton an Enishman, who visited New Eng\n\n land in 1886, gives the following account of compa- ey training, which he attendcd:-\"I It is their custom here for all that can bear to go out training day; but thought pike was best for young sol tier, and so carried pike. And between you and reader there another for it too, and that was, knew not how to shoot off nusket but it was the first time ever was in Being come into the field, the captain called all into close order, in order go to prayer, and then prayed himself. And when our exercises were done, the captain likewise concluded with prayer. Solemn prayer in feld,up- | on day of training, never knew but in New Eng land, where it seems it IS common custom. About three of the clock both exercises and our prayers being over, we had a very noble dinner, to which all the clergy were invited\"\n\n | Colon;z ation Socety-The Secretary of the Ameri- can Colonization Society has given notice that the | Managers making arrangements to fit out or two expeditions for the colony of Liberia, funds shall be received adequate to the accomplish\n\n nent of this object.

            "article": "WILLIAM PLUMBER.\n\n In another part of our paper we have said thatthere many leading politicians in this state, who Op posed to the present administration. Unquestonably more than nine-tenhs of the honest, intelligent free of the state perfectly satisfied with the gene- ra course of the administration and will again give their support to Mir. Adams. Especially this is the fact in Ltchfeld County. We not in the habit of say ing oh relative To ourself but in connexion with the above assertion, which belive to be true, we feel strongly inclined this week saya few wordsup on our own affairs. The have ever taken in relation politics, and especially pending the late state electoneerng campaign, completely in accordance with that pursued by the editor of the Hartford Times, that in instance did he dissent from us or offer one objection expressed opin ions indeed of the offensive articles which appeared in paper,-ofensive to class of poll cians-were extracted from his paper. It is true we accused of commencing the attack upon Legislative caucusses and of taking the lead in the contest but this honor suspect brother Wells will be dis posed to dispute with us. It was not until pol tics calmly settling down for the present year and occasion could be offered for political contro versy that the editor of the Times and his agents in this county recommended an attack upon the republ can character of this paper. To such people as may still feel sort of political horror the name fcde ral beg to be excused for saying that not the value of fig whether we are called federal or democrat; the terms are perfectly indefinite app- ed at the present time, andmean any thing nothlng as suits the convenience of the politician using them is in vain that have called upon the editor ofthe = Il i 4 lcan principles in papcrthe reiterated reply is 'you are an Adams amalgamaton federast.\" .\"-Now with intelligent candid persons, such like indefinite assertions would pass for their real worth, it not for the efforts of certain gentemen who have hereto fore been allowed to exercise some considerable po litical dctation, and who ready to back up such charges with the assertion that the republicans of this county do not support this press approve of the course pursued by it's editor; and that the HART FORD TIMES is the only TRUE republican paper in the state, and the paper of all ohers which THE PAR rY are bound to support. With some few people this argument is unaas,cerabe because the assertions of their political leaders have been questioned ''the good of THE PARTY requiring that they should be be- lieyed and obeyed.\" Although this course has not n- jurcd us it has caused change in the names of our subscribers. Invariably where efforts have been made to stop the circulation of the Post efforts have been made, with equal success, to sustain it, Now if these attacks from the Times, backed up by certain leading politicians in this county, not evil denty owing to national politics, know what fact can be capable of demonstration. Why is the Hart ford Times the only republican paper in the state which accuses of federalism ?-be it remembered, the a,cfI political sin is charged upon Mir. Ad ams and his whole cabinet council, by this republican paragon that at least found in good compa- ny.-Why not these charges preferred against us pending the last state election? Why the prnci pies then advocated so well sustained in ths coun- ty, ifthey were the offspring of political error? Why are leading republican politicians, who known friends the administration, still the supporters ofths press? Why do certain preended friends to the ad- minstration, who think Gen. Jackson very excel lent man, and have objection to try him o,ce as President of the United States\" choose the Times as substitute for this paper ins toad of the Register Mercury, old republican papers, and firmly atachedto Mr. Adams? If streams show which way the tide sets, facts stubborn these show incontestiby that the efforts which the editor of the Times, and few ndi- vduals in this county making to destroy this press originate solely account of national instead of state politics; and that it is not the federalism of this paper which ofends them-but it's opposition to the faction which would elevate Gen. Jackson and his satellites the moral virtue and political liberty the coun- try. Let the freemen look to it--let them learn the motives of their enticers before they are induced to look to the Hartford Times alone for knowledge of political events. Letthem be prepared to discard from the councils of country the greatest and the best men in land, if they determined to believe in the political rcctitude of that paper Let them be pre- pared to reject internal improvements. encouragement to domestic industry, ,and yield implicit submission to Virginia dctatioD, if they prepared reject political herecs all whom the puere editor of the Hartford Times sees fit to prescribe. We shall not suffer by this course, however unwilling we maybe to see individuals under the garb offrcndship labourng assduously support the measures of the open enc. my-individuals who ready to plead their preten- sions of friendship should Mr. Adams again succeed in election, their acts should Gen. Jackson obtain the ascendancy in the tremendous political contest which is approaching.\n\n Speaking of the debates which were had in the Sen ate upon the nomination of Mir. Clay that body by Mir.
