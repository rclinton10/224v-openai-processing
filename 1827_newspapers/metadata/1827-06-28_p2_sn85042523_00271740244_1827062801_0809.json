            "raw_text": "TIE SEASON.--Present appearance\nlu9t'hes the opinion that our harvest will be\nabundant this year. Wheat, Rye, Oats and\nBarley are remarkably fine. The crop Of\ngrass, upland and meadow, is uncommonly\nheavy. Corn begins to thrive, but has been\nvery backward, owing to the cool weather.\nOur farmers will, withstandng the Rat.\ntcring prospect of having full garners, still\nhave something to complain ot--low prices\nfor produce is a grievous thing We hear\nthem already, in our market-(where they\nare offering their last years crop Of oats at\nIS cents, which a month or two ago they\ncould have got 40 cents bushel for) while\ntheir fields are groanng beneath their bur-\ndens, complaining Of low prices. We would\nadvise man. always TO sell his grain when he\ncan get fair price for it, and never wait for\nspeculating breeze to raise it above its val\nuse. When crops are good prices will be\nlow, and when not so good will be proper\ntionably higher; thus we believe by proper\nmanagement but little inconvenience is felt\n~ the farmer in either case. Management\nIS one halt If a farmer can make his cal\nculatiuns properly, and dispose OF his pro\nduce at q suitable time, which is to be as\ncegtained by watching the market, his gain\nover his thoughtless neighbour, will be at\nleast fifteen or twenty per cent Consider.\nable gain may be realized by retailing Ger\ntain crops; what we mean by this is, with\nyour butter and eggs, send a few bushels Of\ncorn oats, potatoes, &c. which will always\nbring extra prices.\n\n\nOur section Of country is not the only one\nenjoying the prospect Of am abundant har.\nvest. In Pennsylvania, and particularly in\nthe neighborhood of the county of Bucks, in\nthat state, the prospect appears erceeding\nilne We observe in late number of the\nBucks County Patriot, printed at Doyles,\ntown, communication to the Editor from\nperson who sends him stalk of rye, taken\nfrom the field of one Joseph Matthews, az\nthe 5, F. end of buckingham Mountain,\nmeasuring feet g. inches in length. Ano-\nther correspondent, who modestly signs him\nself \".Hoderation,\" aifirms that he has one\nstalk growing in his field which approaches\nthe heavens, upan all average, l8 inches\nday. The writer promises to send it to the\nEditor before harvest There is no date to\nthis communication, therefore we DO not\nknow at what time it was written, but we\nmay say at least three weeks before harvest\n50 that when we calculate the growth OF THIS\nstalk for three weeks at eighteen inches per\nday, we find it, at the expiration Of that time\nto be 378 inches, or Sli feet high. We think\na few acres of such rye would, by harves'\nthink no ordinary sickle would be able 20\nreap i.

            "article": "TIE SEASON.--Present appearance\nlu9t'hes the opinion that our harvest will be\nabundant this year. Wheat, Rye, Oats and\nBarley are remarkably fine. The crop Of\ngrass, upland and meadow, is uncommonly\nheavy. Corn begins to thrive, but has been\nvery backward, owing to the cool weather.\nOur farmers will, withstandng the Rat.\ntcring prospect of having full garners, still\nhave something to complain ot--low prices\nfor produce is a grievous thing We hear\nthem already, in our market-(where they\nare offering their last years crop Of oats at\nIS cents, which a month or two ago they\ncould have got 40 cents bushel for) while\ntheir fields are groanng beneath their bur-\ndens, complaining Of low prices. We would\nadvise man. always TO sell his grain when he\ncan get fair price for it, and never wait for\nspeculating breeze to raise it above its val\nuse. When crops are good prices will be\nlow, and when not so good will be proper\ntionably higher; thus we believe by proper\nmanagement but little inconvenience is felt\n~ the farmer in either case. Management\nIS one halt If a farmer can make his cal\nculatiuns properly, and dispose OF his pro\nduce at q suitable time, which is to be as\ncegtained by watching the market, his gain\nover his thoughtless neighbour, will be at\nleast fifteen or twenty per cent Consider.\nable gain may be realized by retailing Ger\ntain crops; what we mean by this is, with\nyour butter and eggs, send a few bushels Of\ncorn oats, potatoes, &c. which will always\nbring extra prices.\n\n\nOur section Of country is not the only one\nenjoying the prospect Of am abundant har.\nvest. In Pennsylvania, and particularly in\nthe neighborhood of the county of Bucks, in\nthat state, the prospect appears erceeding\nilne We observe in late number of the\nBucks County Patriot, printed at Doyles,\ntown, communication to the Editor from\nperson who sends him stalk of rye, taken\nfrom the field of one Joseph Matthews, az\nthe 5, F. end of buckingham Mountain,\nmeasuring feet g. inches in length. Ano-\nther correspondent, who modestly signs him\nself \".Hoderation,\" aifirms that he has one\nstalk growing in his field which approaches\nthe heavens, upan all average, l8 inches\nday. The writer promises to send it to the\nEditor before harvest There is no date to\nthis communication, therefore we DO not\nknow at what time it was written, but we\nmay say at least three weeks before harvest\n50 that when we calculate the growth OF THIS\nstalk for three weeks at eighteen inches per\nday, we find it, at the expiration Of that time\nto be 378 inches, or Sli feet high. We think\na few acres of such rye would, by harves'\nthink no ordinary sickle would be able 20\nreap i.

Never in my life had ] seen\nsuch fearful object, for to the usual hide\nGus and disgusting aspect OF snake, were\nadded features peculiar to its own, and\nwhich almost led me to believe that Satan\nhimself was present before me in the guise\nOf this hateful reptile. rhe light of my\nlanthorn, increased in brightness by pol\n;shed steel reflector, fell in glare upon the\ndeylish apparition, and discerned distinctly\nthat its mouth was wide open, armed with\nlarge crooked fangs, and furnished with a\nlong tongue, that vibrated menacngly be-\nyond its jaws It's head was rather small\nbut, on either side, its neck was swollen out\n20 an immense size. inflated, as | imagined,\nEtak\n20 my veins, when it should spring and seize\nhold of me; but what seemed more horri-\nBILE than all its other deformities, was, that\nin this bloated mass, which bolstered a.\nround its collar, were things which APP\npearcd like two wild eyes. in' addition 10\nthe small ones in its head; and this sight al\nmost convinced me that the monster could\nonly be some diabolical spirit, for | knew\nthat no animals but insects have more than\na pair Of visual organs In \"A state Of mingled\nawe, doubt, and utter dismav, | remained\nholding my lanthoIn, and staring at the dire\ncountena8ce OF the serpent, which all the\nwhile stood erect, waving its body in the\nmanner of rope shaken at one end while\nits tongue played around its lips, its eyes\nslittered, and its scales cleaned. ! felt, or\n1ancied that ! telt, as if facnated by its\nglance, and began to give myselfup for lost;\n{or had heard of the power of fascination\nposse by snakes, which deprives the\nvictim of the energy to escape or defend it.\nself Besides, this creature, serpent or de\nIll, was not a small enemy of the kind. for\nIt stood nearly four feet from the floor,\n7shich, ss my head was fixed down low,\nbrought its head nearly level with my fice;\nand my fear Of moving, lest should pro-\nwoke it to DAFT upon me, held me in state\nof stiffness as complete as if had been rv-\neted by the hateful influence of which / was\nso much afraid.
