On his return he stopped in at the dogs lodgings, and instantly pro- nounced the animal to have one trace of friend to the administration about it.

Jackson's fife and history will hardly bear\n\n \n\n In speaking of this subject last week we were led into an rorby communication in of the south papers. Gen. Jackson did not vote for MT. Clay although he did not oppose his appointment by ex position ofthe facts whchh pretends hcthen had in his possession ;-indeed he was the first to comp men Mr. Adams, in the most fattering manner, upon his elevation the chair of state. This circumstance his warmest partizans will not deny Did we suppose that any candid man could for a moment believe the charge of Gen. might be disposed to adduce more of the reasons which convince us that not the least credit should be attached this foolish ton of corruption, than are here given.-After Mir. Clay had mortally offended Gen. J. by calling him a\n\n mitary chieain, Sc. the latter addressed letter to MT. s. Swartwout, dated Feb. g, 1895, in which there was ian abundant outpouring of the writer's sprt-a pathetic confession of his merits and disap- pointments,-an angry denuncation of the man who had refused to aid in lifting him to the highest eeva- ton he could aspire to underthe constitution yet not word was said about the important matter nicated to him by distinguished member of Con- gress\" After the organization of the opposition in letter, addressed to of his parzans dated at his \"pious ana silent retreat\" the Hermitage July 31, 1896, he characterzes the administration as the \"ene- mics of liberty\" whom he'' is to displace % speaks of the management and intrigue which are opera ting abroad, the magnitude of the principles which hcy ac chued'oiinS to suPpidu anu tie many IheaS which they draw to their assistance from the pat ronage of government\" yet not word about the n rigue which the Beverly letter treats of Neverin all the bitter essays which the general has penned has until recently mentioned his personal knowledge of intrigue and corruption. But to multiply words upon this contemptible letter to Beverly is useless. If of fers made by Mr. Clay's friends those of Gen. J. where are the Generals friends now that they should purposcy keep behind the curtain, and force him to become the public of his political opponents Surely men who are determined to put the admnis- traton down, \"right wrong,\" |\" even were they as pure the angels in heaven, would not have forced their immaculate eader' to leave the solitude of the HERMITAGE to become electioneering leader in the approaching contest, ifany of them had dared pre- fer the charge which the General has now made. If \" offers were made\" they can be proved for have heard of no death Arrangement of intellect among the Jackson members of the House of that day. The men to whom the proposals are said to have been made, might and ought to have been the accusers, and most assuredy would have been thus, had there been the least glimmerngs evidence sustain them in their charge.\n\n Gen. Jackson is rash man proverbialy so. In almost every important act of his life, his headong ungovernable passions have led him to the performance of deeds which better men, upon after consideration would have sorely repented of. Among these rash acts must be set down the writing the letter in ques- ton; and if he has repened of any other of his mistaken deeds, we are much deceived in the man if he does not repent of this. To pant ardently for office which he cannot get but by destroying his oppo nents, and attempt himself this work of destruction and al excite strong feelings of selfcondemna ton, if not of shame and modification.\n\n TO THE PUBLIC.\n\n On my arrival at Wheeling, on the 23d inst, was informed that Mr. Carter Beverley then that place. had received the preceding night by mail letter persons, and left with my friend, Col. Noah Zane for my perusal, which was told formed subject of gen. eral conversation and had produced much excitement in the town. The Captain of the Reindeer, having kindly detained his steamboat for my accommodation and as was unwilling longer to delay his departure,\n\n had only time to obtain nasty, but correct copy of the letter, and seize the first moment, af- ter my arrival home to present it to the public to- gether with copy of another letter, addressed by Mr. Beverley to Col. Zane.\n\n I Ipurposely forbear at this time to make several comments which these documents authorize, and con- fine myself to a notice of the charges which Gen. Jackson has brought forward in his letter.\n\n These charges are, first, That my friends in Con- gress early in Jan 1895, proposed to him that if he would say or permit any of his confidential friends to say, that in case he was elected president, Mir. Ad ams should not be continued Secretary of State, by complete union of myself and friends we would put o.Ito tho nfsal onfaS in hou os,l",

The dogs arithmetic put to a very satsfac tory test. Gen. Samuel Smith of Baltimore. who, in company with Mir.

M Lane was coming up to inqure how long, at the rate of ten millions of dollars year, it would take ' an empty treasury\" to pay off the sixty millions of national debt, but satisfied with the light which Gen. Smith had obtained, he suppressed the question:\n\n few of these smart replies led to the report that the dog was friend to the administrations and 1t was a little curious to hear the judgments passed upon hlm when the idea got abroad. Mir. Cambreling threw out dark hints, that during the late war, and While \" the patriot states were sraning every nerve against the enemy, the dog ranging at large in Newfoundland well known enemy's province urhat circulation was given to this suggestion, and at was introduced by Mr. Cambreling in his reply to his letter of invitation, requesting him to attend public dinner at CommunIpaW, to which the dog was also invited It turned out unlucky, that the poor beast III stead of being Newfoundland dog, o the turn spit breed sired by faithful animal which gave ton and circulation to Gov.

His friends humored him in it, on the ground if the dog not mad there were men that and that at all events if the teuaria did no good, it would do no harm.\n\n How far the prejudice would have spread, that the dog was for the administration, it is impossible to say, had 1t not been for the sagacous doubt raised by Mr. Van Buren, as to the fact. This gentleman has been down with bag of dollars in one hand and a bud- geOn in the other, to William-street where the dog was exhibited, to endeavour to improve the condi ton\" of the National Advocate. On his return he stopped in at the dogs lodgings, and instantly pro- nounced the animal to have one trace of friend to the administration about it. He then took out the \" Coalition Circular\" and running it over, observed that the dog not named in it, of the friends of the Administration, and that if he had been it no positive proof as was shown Tn the Of his Val ued friend, Mr. Webb, of Illinois, who had noby sent to the newspapers private letter addressed to him, under the belief that he was friend to the ad- minstration.

Knowing that the town of TOchimilchO was nearer to the volcano, our adventures determined to proceed to it in order to gain more information with regard to their expe- dition. Governor Olivares, who though the proprietor of the territory upon which the volcano is situated, had never visited it, not only furnished every thing they desired. offer ed to accompany and provide them with guides and servants to carry their varIous instruments, but also gave them the most pressing invitation to his house at Saint CataIine, situated at the foot of that mount ain.\n\n The succeeding day they avaed themselves of the invitation of the GovernOr-and short ly after their arrival at his plantation, he in- formed them that his occupations would not permit him to ascend with them,h he however furnished them with guide who conducted them through thick copse to the limits of the growth of plnes, which they found to be at the height of 12,541 feet Here they passed the night by the side of large fire wrapt in their cloaks about twelve it rain ed & short time afterwards there fell very heavy frost\n\n On the goth they determined to reach the summit, and giving their instruments to the servants mounted the mules, and began the ascent, at half past 8 in the morning by the the light of the moon.-In very short time, they passed the bounds of all vegetation and entered upon sand plain covered with loose stones, Tin passing which the mules were so much fatigued that our travellers were Oblig- ed to abandon them and pursue the journey on fOot.1 measure to which they were also inpelled by the sight Of the immense over hanging pfecipices which it would have heen impossible to pass with the mules.\n\n They therefore ins perseverance of their determination threw their cloaks and two bottles ofwater over their shoulders, and pro- ceeded up the decIivity, making their way with the greatest difficulty over an uneven surface, composed of rocks sand, and pum ice-stone. Desirous ofreaching some preci- pices which appeared to them to extend al most to the desired summit, they pushed for ward with the greatest ardor and for some time with considerable celerity,bu they soon found that the difficulties of the ascent were only beginning so frightful and dangerous was the precipice and so insecure their foot-hold, that though exerting almost supernatural eff forts, they were enabled to make but very little progress, by reason of the sandy nature of the soil and the total want of any brush or shrub by which they might support them selves.\n\n In addition to these disadvantages, the ex- ertions they were obliged to use and the di- unfinished pressure Ofthe air, caused such ex- cessive fatigue. that they were obliged to rest themselves every fifteen or twenty steps, and after toiling on in this manner for half aAmile, they at length arrived at the locks so ar dently desired where they found their In dans who were waiting for them having as- cended the mountain with more ease and greater speed.

Hardly any atrocious could be preferred against representative Of the peo pie in his official character The charge in substance Is, that deliberate propositions of bargain were made by my Congressional friends collectively through authorised and distinguished member of Congress, to Gen. Jackson; that their object was, by these \"means of bargain and corruption\" to exclude Mir. Adams from the Department of State, secure my promotion to office; and that privy and asented to these propositions, and o the employment of those means.\n\n Such being the accusation and the prosecutor, and the issue between us, have now right to expect that he will substantae his charges by the exhibition of satisfactory evidence.

            "article": "\n\n We last week published letter from Gen. Jackson to Carter Beverly, charging Mir. Clay with having sold himself the highest bidder at the late presidential election. We have this week Mir. Clay's answer to this calumny; answer clear, ful and explicit just such an one as the people had right to expect from him-a positive denial of any knowledge of the bargain spoken of by Gen. Jackson. As Mir. Clay's word will be considered of much worth, at least Gen. Jackson's, the latter must prove the charge he has made, or forever lie under the mrutaon of a public caumnator. The parties have fairly joi- ned issue, and the trial be had before the people, who fully competent to decide upon such matters. If Mr. Clay is proved guilty, willing that his guilt should be made to appear pos sibe; if he is acquitted, his distinguished\" accuser must expect to escape that full measure of public indignation which he has been so over anxious to deal out to his opponent. We have no fears for the result. Mir. Clay has never summed an investigation Gen. Jackson's fife and history will hardly bear\n\n \n\n In speaking of this subject last week we were led into an rorby communication in of the south papers. Gen. Jackson did not vote for MT. Clay although he did not oppose his appointment by ex position ofthe facts whchh pretends hcthen had in his possession ;-indeed he was the first to comp men Mr. Adams, in the most fattering manner, upon his elevation the chair of state. This circumstance his warmest partizans will not deny Did we suppose that any candid man could for a moment believe the charge of Gen. might be disposed to adduce more of the reasons which convince us that not the least credit should be attached this foolish ton of corruption, than are here given.-After Mir. Clay had mortally offended Gen. J. by calling him a\n\n mitary chieain, Sc. the latter addressed letter to MT. s. Swartwout, dated Feb. g, 1895, in which there was ian abundant outpouring of the writer's sprt-a pathetic confession of his merits and disap- pointments,-an angry denuncation of the man who had refused to aid in lifting him to the highest eeva- ton he could aspire to underthe constitution yet not word was said about the important matter nicated to him by distinguished member of Con- gress\" After the organization of the opposition in letter, addressed to of his parzans dated at his \"pious ana silent retreat\" the Hermitage July 31, 1896, he characterzes the administration as the \"ene- mics of liberty\" whom he'' is to displace % speaks of the management and intrigue which are opera ting abroad, the magnitude of the principles which hcy ac chued'oiinS to suPpidu anu tie many IheaS which they draw to their assistance from the pat ronage of government\" yet not word about the n rigue which the Beverly letter treats of Neverin all the bitter essays which the general has penned has until recently mentioned his personal knowledge of intrigue and corruption. But to multiply words upon this contemptible letter to Beverly is useless. If of fers made by Mr. Clay's friends those of Gen. J. where are the Generals friends now that they should purposcy keep behind the curtain, and force him to become the public of his political opponents Surely men who are determined to put the admnis- traton down, \"right wrong,\" |\" even were they as pure the angels in heaven, would not have forced their immaculate eader' to leave the solitude of the HERMITAGE to become electioneering leader in the approaching contest, ifany of them had dared pre- fer the charge which the General has now made. If \" offers were made\" they can be proved for have heard of no death Arrangement of intellect among the Jackson members of the House of that day. The men to whom the proposals are said to have been made, might and ought to have been the accusers, and most assuredy would have been thus, had there been the least glimmerngs evidence sustain them in their charge.\n\n Gen. Jackson is rash man proverbialy so. In almost every important act of his life, his headong ungovernable passions have led him to the performance of deeds which better men, upon after consideration would have sorely repented of. Among these rash acts must be set down the writing the letter in ques- ton; and if he has repened of any other of his mistaken deeds, we are much deceived in the man if he does not repent of this. To pant ardently for office which he cannot get but by destroying his oppo nents, and attempt himself this work of destruction and al excite strong feelings of selfcondemna ton, if not of shame and modification.\n\n TO THE PUBLIC.\n\n On my arrival at Wheeling, on the 23d inst, was informed that Mr. Carter Beverley then that place. had received the preceding night by mail letter persons, and left with my friend, Col. Noah Zane for my perusal, which was told formed subject of gen. eral conversation and had produced much excitement in the town. The Captain of the Reindeer, having kindly detained his steamboat for my accommodation and as was unwilling longer to delay his departure,\n\n had only time to obtain nasty, but correct copy of the letter, and seize the first moment, af- ter my arrival home to present it to the public to- gether with copy of another letter, addressed by Mr. Beverley to Col. Zane.\n\n I Ipurposely forbear at this time to make several comments which these documents authorize, and con- fine myself to a notice of the charges which Gen. Jackson has brought forward in his letter.\n\n These charges are, first, That my friends in Con- gress early in Jan 1895, proposed to him that if he would say or permit any of his confidential friends to say, that in case he was elected president, Mir. Ad ams should not be continued Secretary of State, by complete union of myself and friends we would put o.Ito tho nfsal onfaS in hou os,l",
