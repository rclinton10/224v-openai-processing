TENTATIVE TRANSFER STEPS

A breakdown reveals that there will be one train trip each to Heart Mountain and Granada, four train movements to Gila River, and 10 motor trips to Rohwer.
Meanwhile, "processing" of the preference requests, Form WRA-331 (Family Preference Request for Center Transfer), is currently being given deep consideration and study.
Tentative transfer procedure follows:
1. TRANSFER NOTICES - After "processing" of the preference statements, each individual or family head, as the case may be, will be notified of his or their Center of destination and the time of the scheduled departure from this Project.
2. HOUSING ARRANGEMENTS - The Centers of destination are expected to send representatives to the Jerome Project before the actual transfers have started, and the transferees will be notified of the quarters assigned to them in the Center of destination.
3. PACKING AND CRATING - Under the direction of a WRA professional supervisor, a locally trained evacuee crew will undertake the packing and crating, where needed.
4. TRANSPORTATION TO RAILHEAD - Arrangements will be made whereby trucks and other vehicles will pick up the transferees from their barracks locations with their hand luggage and transport them to the railheads.
5. UPON ARRIVAL AT THE RAILHEAD - Upon arrival at the railhead, the persons to depart will be instructed to go to the car near the standard placard with the letter of the car (A, B, etc.) in which they are to ride.
6. ROLL CALL - After the evacuees are seated in the cars, the car monitor, together with the representative of the escort commanders, will make a head check and name check of the evacuees seated in that car.
7. TRAIN BAGGAGE - Transferees are advised to carry with them, as hand baggage and checkable baggage, sufficient clothing and necessary household and personal effects to maintain them for 30 to 60 days in view of transportation and other administrative difficulties that will necessarily be involved in transporting their property separately. Limit hand baggage to necessities.
8. FREIGHT SHIPMENTS - All furniture and other property of the transferees in their barracks apartments or stored in the Jerome Center warehouses will be crated and transported to the Center of destination upon presentation of request (Form WRA-156) by the transferees to the Project Director or his designated representatives.

TRAIN, MOTOR MOVEMENTS

9. TRAIN MOVEMENTS - Under proper escort, each train will include coaches, diner cars, kitchen cars, baggage cars, evacuee Pullmans, escort tourist sleepers, and railway diners.
10. EVACUEE TRAIN WORKERS - They are for coaches: One train monitor, nine coach captains, nine car mothers, two K.P. supervisors, 12 kitchen police, two head waiters, and 12 waiters or waitresses; and for Pullmans: Two cooks and six cook helpers to work alternately.
11. MOTOR CONVOYS - Each of the 10 motor convoys to Rohwer will be composed of passenger trucks, passenger cars, ambulances, trucks for baggage and household goods, wreckage and tow truck, and escort vehicles.
12. CENTERS OF DESTINATION - Their part in the transfer operations includes housing assignments for the Jerome transferees, arrangements for induction and employment of transferees, and receipt of their freight and baggage. They also provide riders for the train and motor movements.
13. PAY AND CLOTHING ALLOWANCES - Accrued work pay and clothing allowances will be sent to the transferees at their new addresses in the Center of destination.

COOPERATION OF ALL IS ESSENTIAL.
