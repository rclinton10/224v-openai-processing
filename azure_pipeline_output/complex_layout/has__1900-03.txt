when communicating at about midnight
copies of the messages exchanged be-

Kimberley, stated that no further news
had been received up to that hour and
nothing of importance has come from
other sources during the night.
The week's sorties, skirmishes, recon-
noissances and bombardments at various
points where the British and the Boers
confront each other, so far as can be
Judged, have had no effect upon the gen-
eral situation at the seat of war, which is
practically the same as it was a week
ago.
During the night of December 28th
Ladysmith and Chieveley camp were in
full communication, the former reporting
"all well." While the signalling was in
progress the Boers attempted to muddle
the messages with flash lights from each
extremity of their long, entrenched li
The naval brigade took advantage of the
opportunity to shell the Boer position,

morning of December 2

failed to elicit any signs of life.

that an armored train, had restored com-

NEWS FROM AFRICA NOT GOOD.
London, January 1 .- In the absence of
confirmation of the reported sortie from
Ladysmith, that story is discredited. No
such hopeful view can be taken as the
Boer account of the Mafeking sortie
seems to convey. No word regarding any
such movement has yet arrived from
British sources and the feeling of sus-
pense is deepening, as it is feared Colo-
nel Baden-Powell's silence indicates that
his position is becoming desperate.
The dispatches from the front
breathe a confident spirit, which is
by no means echoed here.
The lates: Ladysmith advices
show that the Boer shelling is be-
coming deadly, while sickness and
ennui must also be telling strongly
upon the garrison.
The news of the spread of a rebellion
among the Dutch colonists and of the
attempts of Boers to cut the railway at
widely different points is very disquieting
as bearing upon the safety of the ex-
tended lines of communication.
All the correspondents are beginning to
hint at a forward movement on the part
of General Buller, the danger of which
is indicated in a dispatelt to The Daily
Telegraph from Frere recording the un-
fortunate failure of two reconnaissances.
In one case the Boer lines at Colenso
were to have been bombarded by night.
Mounted men drew the Boer fire, and It
was intentled that the naval guns should
bombard. This, however, the latter fall
ed to do, owing to some misunderstand-
Ing, and the reconnoltering party was
compelled to flounder back to camp
through the wet and stormy night, march-
ing in mud and water with the greatest
discomfort.
According to the same correspondent
similar fate awaited another reconnais-
ance in the opposite direction.
"Two detachments," says the cis-
patch, "lost their way in the dark-
ness. They were unable to effect a
junction for attack, they stumbled
into water holes and were out all
night, only to return drenched and
disappointed in the morning."
It is roughly estimated that there are
25.000 Boers between Ladysmith and Co-
lenso, some 49 being on the south side
of the Tugela river. At all points the
enemy shows ceaseless activity.
A large number of Americans are said
to be finding their way into the various
volunteer regiments being raised in Cape
Colony.
It is also reported that many
Africans are arriving at Delagoa bay,
having been expelled from the rand be-
cause they had refused to work the Jo-
hannesbure mines for the government.
British Destroy Cannon.
London. December 31-A dispatch to
The Daily Mail from Lorenzo Marques
dated December 9th, says:
"It is reported from Ladysmith, by way
of Pretoria, that the British are destroy-
ing their heavy cannon, prior to a final
sortie. The Transvaal agents here have
bought up all the available milk, sugar
and coffee. They have managed to get
large orders sent for shipment here by
Fresch and German steamers. Prices
have advanced 50 per cent in consequence
and the stocks are very short. Something

Boers Bombard Ladysmith.
Londen, January 1 .- The following hello-
graph message has been received by way
of Weenen from Ladysmith, dated Wed-
nesday, December 27th:
"The Boers are actively bombarding the
town. One shell struck the Devonshire
mess tent,
killing Captain Dalzel and
wounding seven lieutenants-Dent, Twiss,

A later dispatch from Ladysmith by
way of Ween.J., dated Friday, Decem-

SUPPLIES FROM NEW ORLEANS.
Boers Have Bought Large Quantities
of Corn from That Port.
New Orleans, December 26 .- The Brit-
Ish consul here is authority for the
statement that New Orleans has been
one of the chief ports used by Boer agents
for securing supplies for use in the Trans-
vaal, and that British ships have been
used largely in their shipment. Corn,
it seems, has been one of the principal
staples bought for the purpose and was
bought and shipped away from this port
without creating either comment or sus-
picion. The British authorities, however,
appear to have been possessed of more
or less information on the subject for
some time, but have been powerless to
stop the shipments. The plan, the Brit-
ish consul says, has been to ship the
grain and other supplies from New Or-
Jeans, to Rotterdam and there reship to
ports from which the Transvaal could
be reached.
British ships were used to
carry the supplies as far as Rotterdam.
Investigation here tonight revealed the
fact that the quantity of corn shipped
from New Orleans to F
o Rotterdam ti
season has been in excess of 3,000,000
bushels, while the legitimate trade has
never required more than 400,000 bushels.
BOER AGENT IS IN TROUBLE.
Chicago, December 26 .- A special to
The Record from El Paso says an agent
of the Boer republic is in the city for the
purpose of enlisting men for the war with
Great Britain. He is well supplied with
funds and claimed to have come from
the Transvaal. He reached this city Sat-
urday from San Francisco and his in-
tention was to cross the river into Mexico
and operate from that side of the line.
His purpose might not have been disclos-
ed had he not got into a dispute with
an Englishman and been shot at several
times. He went to a firm of lawyers,
Turney & Burgess, and engaged them to
prosecute his assallant.

Montejo's
Defense
Before Court-
martial.
Chicago, December 31 .- The Tribune to-
day prints the text of Admiral Montejo's
defense under courtmartial proceedings
for his defeat at Manila.
The bulk of
the blame is charged by the admiral not
to himself or his fleet, but to the Spanish
government for its unprepared condition.
He also claims that Admiral Dewey kept
out of range of the Spanish guns -- a pro-
ceeding which Montejo refers to as "a
retreat." Montejo says:
"The only preparation that had been
made for war was made by the Ameri-
cans, who were business and arranged
everything with pencil and paper.
The
Initial velocity of our cannon was bl
meters; that of the smallest cannon of
our enemies was to0 meters.
Admiral
Dewey, with pencil in hand, noted the
thickness of his mantiets and casements
and knew what energy was required to
penetrate them. He also knew exactly
the weight of the most powerful projec-
tile of our ships, and by a simple mathe-
matical calculation he arrived at the dis-
tance at which he could fight without
himself receiving any harm.
Thus he
ascertained that he could light at a dis-
tance of 2,000 or 3,000 meters with abso-
luto impnuity.
The situation, therefore
was just this: We were vulnerable to
all the projectiles of the enemy, and this
the enemy well knew, while he got out
of reach of our cannon and remained out
of reach all the while."
Admiral Montejo adds:
"In order to give an idea of our mis-
erable situation I may mention that we
had only fourteen torpedoes for the de
fense of 2,000 meters of space and that
the cable, which we obtained in Hong
Kong, was only long enough for five tor-
pedoes and, therefore, only five torpedoes
could be placed."
PRICE OF DANISH WEST INDIES
United States Is Said To Be Trading
with King Christian.
London, January 1 .- The Copenhagen
correspondent of The Daily Mail says:
The sale of the Danish West Indies to the
United States bids fair to be accom-
plished. The Danish Captain Christmas,
who has influential connections in the
United States and who has secured the
support of President Mckinley, Admiral
Dewey and a number of influential Amer-
Ican senators, is acting as intermediary
between the two governments, direct of-
ficial communication being impossible for
Denmark after repeated fallures in pre-
of the mountains, thus increasing the dif-
ficulties of General Young's troops to ef-
fect a rescue.

The United States is the leading diary
country of the world. Ten years ago the
annual value of the dairy products of this
country was estimated to exceed $100,000,-
000. There are about 17,000,000 cows in this
country, or about one to every four inhab-
itants. One good cow furnishes the milk,
butter and cheese for more than four per-
sons, as large quantities of dairy products
are exported. In some of the old European
countries, two or three times as much
cheese is consumed per capita as in the
United States. The average consumption
of milk in this country is twenty-five and
one-half galions per year to each person.
"This means an ordinary sized tumbler fun

gallons of muk per year or about enougn

Ten years ago 40 per cent of the pork

A great deal of valuable information is
contained in the pamphiet on breeds of
hogs and the proper kind of feed for them.
The Plymouth Rock is suggested as
