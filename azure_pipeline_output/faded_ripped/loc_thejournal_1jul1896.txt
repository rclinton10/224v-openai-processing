According to these women there is only

COULDN'T KEEP A SECRET.
Bath owns a house at No. 27 Stagg

Frank Hilsenbeck, his wife and four small
children reside. Rath formerly owned the
Hilsenbeck house, but it was seized for
non-payment of taxes some time since, and
he frequently told Polly that he had been
robbed of his property. It was owing to
Polly's unfortunate habit of repeating her

Case. .. / the protection of the

The case will be re
master's conndential communications that
Rath was first suspected of a crime com-
mitted last August. At that time his
threats against the Hilsenbecks were nu-
merous, and one Sunday morning, as Mrs.
Hilsenbeck was cooking in the kitchen,
there came a loud explosion. The front
of the stove was blown across the room,
while a sheet of flame and smoke shot into
her face, burning her painfully. In a sub-
sequent search among the embers a small
piece of burst gas pipe was found.
Rath was not suspected until several
days later, when Polly, seated upon the
fence which separates the yards, was heard
to exclaim in German: "Never mind, Polly,
we'll blow 'em up next time!" A little
later Polly softly muttered in English,
"We'll get 'em out of there dead or alive,
eh, Polly?" That set Mrs. Hilsenbeck
thinking, and she consulted an attorney,
who advised her to keep a strict watch.
WATCHED THE WORKSHOP.
About four weeks ago she noticed that
Rath was spending most of his time in his
workshop, which adjoins a goose house
owned by the Hilsenbecks, and through
two knot holes a view of the interior of the
shop can be obtained. One afternoon Polly
was heard to say: "Shall we fix them
soon, Polly?" and this made Mrs. Hilsen-"
beck vigilant. On May 22 she saw Rath
enter the workshop with Polly on his shoul-
der, and then she determined to secure
witnesses to what he was doing. Accord-
ingly she sent for two young ladies who
live near by-the Misses Haller and Skin-
ner-and Michael Murphy. The four en-
tered the goose house and claim that they
saw Rath working upon a hollow tube of
wood. They further allege that they saw
him drive a number of nails into this tube,
pour a black powdered substance into it,
and then affix cotton in either end. Occa-
sionally, however, Polly would make some
remark such as "Now we've got 'em," and
"Now they'll get out."
Three days later Polly sat on the fence
again talking to herself. "D-n Hilsen-
becks," she would say, and then emphasize
this opinion of her neighbors by the un-
kind words "D-n robbers. After half an
hour of similar ruminations she stretched
her wings and flew to her master, who
was approaching, crying out: "This'll blow
'em away, won't it, Polly?"
On Sunday morning last, as was told to
the police that day, Mrs. Hilsenbeck, while
gathering fuel for her kitchen fire, found
a stick of wood, besmirched with mud,
among the clean and newly chopped kind-
lings in the woodpile. The police, when
they examined it, pronounced it to be a
bomb containing a sufficient quantity of
No. 1 saltpetre to blow the entire Hilsen-
beck family across Newark Bay and out to
sea. Therefore Rath was arrested, and
if Polly doesn't know enough to keep her
mouth shut the neighbors say it may go
hard with him.
All day yesterday Polly was flying here
and there about the Rath premises, crying
out vainly for "Papa Rath," and only va-
rying her remarks with occasional refer-
ences to the "D-n Hilsenbecks."

BRADY FOOLED DENNETT.
Didn't Testify Against Captain /Martens as
the Parkhurst "Angel" Expected
He Would.
On the charge of accepting a bribe of $15,
Captain Frederick W. Marteras, of the East
Thirty-fifth Street Police Station, was
placed on trial before Commissioner Roose-
velt, at Police Headquarters, yesterday
morning. The Parkhurst Society was in-
strumental in pushing t'ne charge against
Martens, which dates back to 1891. when
he was a sergeant in the Tremont Station.
It is alleged that he designated Moses P.
Hamilton's store, at No. 1955 West Farms
road, in the Thirty-fourth Election District
of the Twenty-fourth Assembly District,
as a favorable polling place, for which he,
demanded $15. Lawyer Frank Moss acted
as prosecuting attorney, while Friend &
House acted as counsel for Martens.
"Angel" Dennett, with his tan-colored bag
and yachting hat, was also on hand.
Ex-Policeman Michael W. Brady, who
was attached to, the Tremont Station at
the time of the alleged bribe taking, testi-
fied that he and. Sergeant Martens had vis-
ited Hamilton's, place in August, 1891, and
on another occasion. Brady was a witness
for the prosecution, but he proved a sur-
prise to Law yer Moss, and caused a little
tilt between counsel.
He
old, and had never left that order. the
stated that Sister Carmelita inherited be-
property, the value of which is now ten
tween $150,000 and $200,000, about ter
years ago, after she had become a Sis
ot
of Charity.
When asked if Sister Carmelita had nn
taken the vow of poverty, Mr. Sulliva-
said she had done so, but had received per
mission from Vicar-General Quinn, the
spiritual adviser of the order, to hold the
property.
Sister Melita strengthened the testimony
by stating that Sister Carmelita was
granted the privilege of holding the prop-
erty for the benefit of her neice, Mary
Sullivan.
"Were you ever asked the question, 'Did
you see any money paid?' by the Commis-
sioners of Accounts?" asked Mr. Moss.
"Yes."
"What was your answer?" A
Dr. Geoffrey R. Rourke, of No. 144 West
Twelfth street, Sister Carmelita's medical
adviser, was called to the stand as the Sur-
rogate's witness, but it was decided that
many of the statements made to him in con-
fidence by Sister Carmelita should not be
brought out. He had been Sister Carmeli-
ta's medical adviser during December, 1894,
and after that time.
He described the physical condition of
Sister Carmelita, and said she weighed 200
pounds, but that when he was first called
to attend her she was very much run down.
He said she was suffering from a torpid
liver and general weakness.
Dr. Bourke was excused before he had
finished giving his testimony, as he had an
important engagement. He will take the
stand again to-day.
"I answered, by advice of my counsel,
that it might incriminate me."
When asked if "Angel" Dennett had ap
proached him, he testified that if he would
do certain work for the society Dennett
had promised him he would get $500. "He
said that I had been made a scapegoat of
from A to Z, and that if I would testify
against the Captain I would be well taken
care of," said Brady, "but I want to say
righit here that I was in Hamilton's store
with Martens and that I saw no money
pasis between the two, and I don't believe
an y was paid him."
The hearing was adjourned to next Frl-
day.
Blind Women to Get Pensions.
Corporation Counsel Scott decided yester-
day that the blind women, now under the
care of the Charities Commission, need not
take out naturalization papers in order to
receive their $37 a year from the out-door
relief fund. Some of the women caine her
