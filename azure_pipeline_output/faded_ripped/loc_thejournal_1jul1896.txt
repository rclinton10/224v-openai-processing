he frequently told Polly that he had been

Polly's unfortunate habit of repeating her
master's confidential communications that
Rath was first suspected of a crime com-
mitted last August. At that time his
threats against the Hilsenbecks were nu-
merous, and one Sunday morning, as Mrs.
Hilsenbeck was cooking in the kitchen,
there came a loud explosion.
The front
of the stove was blown across the room,
while a sheet of flame and smoke shot into
her face, burning her painfully. In a sub-
sequent search among the embers a small
piece of burst gas pipe was found.
Rath was not suspected until several
days later, when Polly, seated upon the
fence which separates the yards, was heard
to exclaim in German: "Never mind, Polly,
we'll blow 'em up next time!"
A little
later Polly softly muttered in English,
"We'll get 'em out of there dead or alive,

thinking, and she consulted an attorney
who advised her to keep a strict watch.

WATCHED THE WORKSHOP.
About four weeks ago she noticed that
Rath was spending most of his time in his
workshop, which adjoins a goose house
owned by the Hilsenbecks, and through
two knot holes a view of the interior of the
shop can be obtained. One afternoon Polly
was heard to say: "Shall we fix them
soon, Polly?" and this made Mrs. Hilsen-
beck vigilant. On May 22 she saw Rath
enter the workshop with Polly on his shoul-
der, and then she determined to secure
witnesses to what he was doing. Accord-
ingly she sent for two young ladies who
live near by-the Misses Haller and Skin
ner-and Michael Murphy. The four en-
tered the goose house and claim that they
saw Rath working upon a hollow tube of
wood. They further allege that they saw
him drive a number of nails into this tube,
pour a black powdered substance into it,
and then affix cotton in either end. Occa-
sionally, however, Polly would make some
remark such as "Now we've got 'em," and
Three days later Polly sat on the fence

On the charge of accepting a bribe of $15,
Captain Frederick W. Marteras, of the East
Thirty-fifth Street Police Station, was
placed on trial before Commissioner Roose-

strumental in pushing t'ne charge against
Martens, which dates back to 1891. when
he was a sergeant in the Tremont Station.
It is alleged that he designated Moses P.
