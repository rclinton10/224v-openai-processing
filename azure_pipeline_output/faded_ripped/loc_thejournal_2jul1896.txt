One of the most interesting aspects of the present extraordinary political crisis is the
effect which it has produced upon the stock market According to the best obtainable es-
timates, there has been within the past fortnight a shrinkage of values amounting to about
THREE HUNDRED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

at Berea.
Everybody realizes that the Democratic platform is going to demand free silver. This
·realization affects the market in various ways. Perhaps some great operators may be se-
cretly willing to give the country an object lesson of the effect the free coinage policy would
have upon Prosperity. Suggestions to this effect have not been lacking. But undoubtedly
much of the liquidation has been genuine. There has been sufficient panicky talk in the pa-
pers and among politicians to alarm small investors. Putting two and two together-the
admittedly wonderful growth of silver sentiment and the disasters which local authorities
have predicted from its success-there has been reason enough for timid speculators to take
to the woods.

The extent to which they have migrated in that direction is displayed in the figures.
In twelve days from the time of McKinley's nomination, when confidence and stocks were
at their highest, the total value of twenty-nine listed securities dealt in on the New York
Stock Exchange, has shrunk by $59,260,000. The shrinkage in the hundreds of stocks not
listed cannot be accurately fixed, but a careful estimate of the decline in this market puts it at
$300,000,000. Burlington is worth $6,400,000 less than twelve days ago, Atchison $5,373,000,
Sugar $6,000,000,, Chicago Gas $2,000,000, Southern Railroad, $4,000,000, and so on down
the list.

Sugar went down 3{ points yesterday, Manhattan 3ª, Northwestern 3} and other stocks
in proportion. The whole day was one of steady and rapid declines. There was a rush
to sell from the time the Exchange opened. Frightened investors and bears continued to
keep the market on the slide, but the efforts of the bears to create a panic were happily unsuc-
cessful. Their rum or that $4,000,000 or $5,000,000 in gold would be shipped this week proved
unfounded. Only $200,000 in gold was taken from the Sub- Treasury yesterday for ship-
ment. The action cof the Chicago Convention seems to be pretty thoroughly discounted by
this time, and the actual adoption of a free coinage platform will not come as a shock and
may not have much ¿additional effect.

ILTELU J WUND
IS LAW TO
SILVER.
IZen.
Altgeld Wants No Honors.
Governor Altgeld may not be temporary
chairman of the convention, after all. The
silverites had determined that their leader
must go.
According to this plan, Richardson, of
Iowa, and Prather, of Missouri, must ac-
company Secretary Sheerin in his walk to
the political guillotine. Illinois has already
disposed of Ben Cable at Altgeld's com-
mand, and it is even hinted that the Gov-
ernor has not only counselled, but in-
sisted on the removal of the gold commit-
teemen in other States.

With hostilities so plainly declared be-
tween the silver forces and the National
Committee, it is not to be expected that
the latter organization will receive the
bimetallists' demand to name the tempo-
rary chairman with any degree of cordial-
ity. There is talk of a compromise among
the conservative men on both sides, but
Altgeld, Jones, Stone, Turpie and Daniel
"It is a task that I have no liking for,"
said the Governor. "I prefer to be on the
floor of the convention in my capacity of
delegate. I have not inquired how far
the movement to present my name for
chairman has gone, but I desire to say that
I will not be a candidate."
Hinrichsen visited the Palmer House
and Auditorium to-night and told the
Bland and Boies managers about Governor
Altgeld's decision. The withdrawal of the
Governor from the race for chairman has
left the field open to all comers, and there
will not be a scarcity of candidates. Dis-
patches from New York announcing that
Senator Hill will be the candidate of the
gold standard delegations of the Eastern
States for temporary chairman have at-
tracted much interest among the silver
men in Chicago. Indeed, there is a settled
belief among members of the National Bi-
metallic Committee that the senior New
York Senator will be the choice of the
National Committee for the position. There
will be less opposition to him than to any
other gold standard man who might be
named for the important post, for the
reason that Senator Hill's Senatorial col-
leagues who are in control of the bi-
metallic organization are of the opinion
that he would perform the duties of tem-
porary chairman fairly and as a Democrat.
The bimetallists have a candidate for
temporary chairman in Senator Harris, of
Tennessee, and, if not acceptable, they will
present the name of Senator Jones, of Ar-
kansas. This, however, would simply be a
fulfilment of the Senatorial programme to
run the convention.
Altgeld Will Have No Gold.
"We have a majority, and propose to take
possession and run the convention as we
please," they say, using the immortal
words of stalwart "Buck" Hinrichsen. The
silver men can name the permanent chair-
man by virtue of their numbers, but custom
decrees that the National Committee shall
select the temporary chairman.
If the
committee choose a gold Democrat for that
position he would simply deliver a speech
against free silver and then, by force of
circumstances, hand the convention over
to the silver leaders. But the silver men
don't want to even let the gold Democrats
have that much show. Governor Altgeld's
idea is to shut the goldbugs out entirely,
and if his plan goes this will be done.
"The situation is not encouraging to the
anti-free silver Democrats of the party,"
said William F. Harrity, Chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, who ar-
rived in Chicago at 10 o'clock this morning.
He had not been in town half an hour be-
fore there was a rush for his room at the
Wellington. His colleagues on the commit-
tee obtained an immediate audience with
him, and for two hours they explained the
situation to him.
The arrival of Chairman Harrity and the
congregation of the National Committee-
men revived the talk of the gold Demo-
crats bolting the nomination of silver can-
didates, and the adoption of a 16 to 1
platform. Such talk greatly enraged the
silver men. Being beaten in a fair fight,
they say, the gold men should line up.
The threat is made boldly now that when
the convention is over not one of the pres-
ent committee, who hails from a silver
State, will be left, with the exception of
men like Campeau, of Michigan, who is an
out-and-out silver enthusiast.
Wallace Turned Down.
Hugh C. Wallace, of the State of Wash-
ington, a gold man and supporter of the
Administration, was picked by the Nation-
al Committee. He had a reasonable cer-
tainty of calling the convention to order
until Altgeld and silver men of his kind
held their conference yesterday at which
it was divulged that Wallace was the man
selected for the temporary chairmanship.
His gilded opinions did not, it seems, hurt
the silverites so much as his friendliness
to Cleveland and the possibility that he
would in his speech laud the Administra-
tion and make the most of the opportunity
to do his friend at Washington a good turn.
Altgeld dilated upon this particularly ob-
jectionable trait in Mr. Wallace's charac-
ter and others in the conference agreed it
was impossible Wallace could act.

should be made either temporary or perma-
nent chairman, but it seems that the Gov-
ernor wants neither. At least, he said to-
day that he was not a candidate for chair-
manship honors.
He added that if his
friends desired to meet his views they
would not attempt to present his name to
the Committee on Temporary Organization.

Journal Convention Headquarters, Palmer
I ouse, Chicago, July 1 .- Governor Altgeld
u iconsciously pointed a certain moral this
a.ternoon. It was at the Sherman House,
and he was the centrepiece of a picture
never to be forgotten by those who saw it.
To the right ran a stream of such men as
Hinrichsen, Stone, of Missouri, Trude and
Ladd, of Illinois. On his left were grouped
Bryan, of Nebraska; Turpie, of Indiana;
Daniel, of Virginia; McConnell, of Chicago,
with little rivulets of statesmen and poli-
ticians running to the doors. Behind him
was the great stairway, with bronze stat-
es upholding globes for light.
And in the centre stood Altgeld, alone.
Short of stature, he seems still shorter by
ason of the droop which affects his whole
ame. The face is listless, the eyes slow,
le brow tilted forward. One hand plays
Ith a fragment of beard, the other is in
e trousers pocket. The hair is of that
ct, which seems never newly cut, but to
›vy into only a shabby and uneven length.
e beard looks untrimmed and is short.
e clothes are of the "ready made" ap-
rance. They hang discouraged on that
ping frame. The knees of the trousers
wofully and the vest is creased across
many wrinkles. The coat creeps un-
in on the shoulders. The hat is gone.
wold is the strongest figure in
utical situation to-day.

Gold Men Marked to Go.
Secretary Sheerin, of the National Com-
mmittee, to-day experienced the first gust
of the silver storm, which is hanging over
his devoted head. He is a pronounced gold
man; his State is for silver, and the con-
sequence is he is marked for slaughter.
Advance agents of the Indiana delegation
passed the word along to-day that Sheerin
is to be turned down. Many of the Indiana
would vote for him if t}

Vice-President Stevenson Appears.
Vice-President Stevenson slipped into the
Palmer House early this morning. As he
is looked upon as a Presidential quantity,
his appearance at this time made a slight
sensation. The rumor went out that he
had arrived to take a personal interest in
his own ambition, or to act as peacemaker
between the East and the West. He dis-
sipated every rumor by declaring that his
visit had no significance. "I am on my
way home," he said, "and I will not be
here during the convention."
