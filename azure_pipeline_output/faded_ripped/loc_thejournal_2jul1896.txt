Interesting Array of Figures Which

Effect of the Present Political Crisis
Upon the Stock Market.

A Mob of Ten Thousa.
One of the most interesting aspects of the present extraordinary political crisis is the
effect which it has produced upon the stock market According to the best obtainable es-
timates, there has been within the past fortnight a shrinkage of values amounting to about
THREE HUNDRED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

at Berea.
Everybody realizes that the Democratic platform is going to demand free silver. This
·realization affects the market in various ways. Perhaps some great operators may be se-
cretly willing to give the country an object lesson of the effect the free coinage policy would
have upon Prosperity. Suggestions to this effect have not been lacking. But undoubtedly
much of the liquidation has been genuine. There has been sufficient panicky talk in the pa-
pers and among politicians to alarm small investors. Putting two and two together-the
admittedly wonderful growth of silver sentiment and the disasters which local authorities
have predicted from its success-there has been reason enough for timid speculators to take
to the woods.

The extent to which they have migrated in that direction is displayed in the figures.
In twelve days from the time of McKinley's nomination, when confidence and stocks were
at their highest, the total value of twenty-nine listed securities dealt in on the New York
Stock Exchange, has shrunk by $59,260,000. The shrinkage in the hundreds of stocks not
listed cannot be accurately fixed, but a careful estimate of the decline in this market puts it at
$300,000,000. Burlington is worth $6,400,000 less than twelve days ago, Atchison $5,373,000,
Sugar $6,000,000,, Chicago Gas $2,000,000, Southern Railroad, $4,000,000, and so on down
the list.

to sell from the time the Exchange opened. Frightened investors and bears continued to
keep the market on the slide, but the efforts of the bears to create a panic were happily unsuc-
cessful. Their rum or that $4,000,000 or $5,000,000 in gold would be shipped this week proved
unfounded. Only $200,000 in gold was taken from the Sub- Treasury yesterday for ship-
ment. The action cof the Chicago Convention seems to be pretty thoroughly discounted by
this time, and the actual adoption of a free coinage platform will not come as a shock and
may not have much ¿additional effect.

"The situation is not encouraging to the
anti-free silver Democrats of the party,"
said William F. Harrity, Chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, who ar-
rived in Chicago at 10 o'clock this morning.
He had not been in town half an hour be-
fore there was a rush for his room at the
Wellington. His colleagues on the commit-
didates, and the adoption of a 16 to 1
platform. Such talk greatly enraged the
silver men. Being beaten in a fair fight,
they say, the gold men should line up.
The threat is made boldly now that when
the convention is over not one of the pres-
ent committee, who hails from a silver
State, will be left, with the exception of
