have bid a grand slam if North
had been able to show three kings
over the Blackwood five-no-trump
call. It was unfortunate, however,
that South did not do better with
the excellent material in hand, at
the excellent contract.

need the spade finesse, partner."
Forthwith, he took that finesse, and
his disgust was doubled and re-
doubled when East smothered the
spade queen and laid down the
king of clubs. Down one!

could have been made in several
ways, but some of these would in-
volve the use of complicated end-
