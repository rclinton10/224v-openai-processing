LIGHTS FOR BIRDS' NESTS
Some Carlous Habits Practiced In

Many birds suspend their nests from
the branches of trees, one of the most
curious nests of that kind being tha
of the baya bird of India. It is hu
from the branch. with its opening a
the bottom, and bangs like an inverte
bottle, secure from the approach of
tree snakes and other reptiles. Th
most curious thing about the bay:
bird is that it is said to light up its
nest by sticking fireflies on its sid
with clay or soft mud. There seems t
be little doubt of the fact.
Dr. Buchanan says: "At night eac
of the habitations is lighted up by.
Gretly stuck in the top with a plece o
clay.
The nest consists of two rooms
Sometimes there are three or four fire
dies, and their blaze in the little cell
dazzles the eyes of the bats, which of
ten destroy the young of these birds."
Perhaps other animals are scared of
by the baya bird's electric light, sine
