HAPPY CHRISTMAS FOR EVERYBODY
A HOLIDAY
STOCK
That Is First in Variety and Quality and
Fairest in Price
My beautiful display of gifts meets all requirements from FIRST
to LAST. New and beautiful designs in cut glass, mahogany and
chime clocks, gold handled umbrellas, gold mounted fountain pens.
Silverware of endless variety, all sorts of nugget jewelry, hundreds
of first class watches in beautifully engraved cases, and the dis-
play of diamonds and other precious stones is unusually large. Get
one of these if you can't think of anything else.
My store is old, (having been established in Juneau for twen-
ty-seven years) but the stock is fresh and new, and when you get
it at Valentine's you know it is right.
