DEMOCRACY.
BY JOHN G. WHITTIER.
"All things whatsoever ye would that men should
do unto you, do ye even so untothem.-MATT.vii. 12.
Oh! fairest born of Love and Light,
Yet bending brow and eye severe
On all which pains the holy sight,
Or wounds the perfect ear!
Beautiful yet thy temples rise,
Though there profaning gifts are throw b.
And fires enkindled to the skies,
Are glaring on thy altar-stone.
Still sacred--though thy name be breathed
By those whose hearts thy truth deride;
And garlands plucked from thee are wreathed
Around the haughty brow of Pride.
Oh! idol of my boyhood's time,
The faith in which my father stood,
E'en when the suns of Lust and crime
Had stained thy peaceful courts with blood.
Still to those courts my footsteps turn,
For through the mists that darken there,
I see the flames of Freedom burn,
The Kebla of the patriot's prayer.
The generous feeling, pure and warm,
Which owns the right of all divine,
The pitying heart- the helping arm-
The prompt self-sacrifice are thine.
Beneath thy broad, impartial eye,
How fade the lines of taste and birth!
How equal in their sufferings lie
The groaning multitudes of earth!
Still to a stricken brother true,
Whatever clime hath nurtured him,
As stooped to heal the wounded Jew
The worshipper of Gerizim.
By misery uniepelled, unawed
By pomp or power, thou seest a MAN
In prince or peasant-slave or lord-
Pale priest or swarthy artisan.
Through all disguise, form, place, or name,
Beneath the flaunting robes of sin,
Through poverty and squalid shame,
Thou lookest on the man within;
On man, as man, retaining yet,
Howe'er deb ised, and soiled, and dim,
The crown upon his forehead set-
The immortal gift of God to him.
And there is reverence in thy look;
For that frail form which mortals wear
The spirit of the Holiest took,
And veiled his perfect brightness there.
Not from the poor and shallow fount
Of vain philosophy thou art;
He who of old on Syria's mount
Thrilled, warmed by turns the listener's heart.
In holy words which cannot die,
In thoughts which angels yearned to know,
Proclaimed thy message from on high,
Thy mission to a world of woe.
That voice's echo hath not died!
From the blue sea of Galilee,
And Tabor's lonely mountain side,
It calls a struggling world to thee.
Thy name and watchword o'er this land
I hear in every breeze that stirs;
And round a thousand altars etand
Thy banded party worshippers.
Not to these altars of a day,
At party's call my gift I bring;
But on my olden shrine I lay
A freeman's dearest offering!
The voiceless utterance of his will-
His pledge to Freedom and to Truth,
That manhood's heart remembers still
The homage of its generous youth.
CONSTANCY.
BY GEORGE HERBERT.
Who is the honest man?
He that doth still and strongly good pursue-
To God, his neighbor, and himself most true;
Wnom neither force nor fawning can
Unpin, or wrench from giving all their due:
Whose honesty is not
So loose or easy that a ruffing wind
Can blow away, or glittering look it blind;
Who rides his sure and even trot,
While the world now rides by, now lags behind;
Who, when great trials come,
Nor seeks, nor shuns them, but doth calmly stay
Till he the thing and the example weigh;
All being brought into a sum,
What place or person calls for he doth pay:
Whom none can work or woo
To use in anything a trick or sleight,
For, above all things, he abhors deceit,
Ilis words, and works, and fashion too,
All of a piece, and all are clear and straight:
Who never melts or thaws

He who gives little from his store,
If little be his means,
Treads on as far the heavenward shores,
As he who gives ten times the more,
If ten times more his gains.

And walk within a zone of light;
There is a treasury of g. d-

Thou may'st not have one piece of gold
To bless the poor man's palm;
But angels will with joy behold,
If thou hast word which can be told,
His troubled heart to calm:
For kind words are as honied streams,
And he the walker of the sod,
Who gives them to his brother, seems
A messenger from God!
There are abuses deep and loud,
Hoarse voices shrieking "Bread!"
And there are noble spirits bowed,
And forms that flit among the crowd,
Like phantoms from the dead.
Crush but one atom of abuse,
Stay bat particle of sm,
And God will sanctify the use
Of all thy powers therein.
And if thy brother weaker be,
If folly mark his path;
And if that thou be folly free-
If Knowledge clingeth unto thee,
Give not contempt nor wrath.
But from the garner of thy worth,
And from thy store of truth and light,
To serve thy brother's wants on earth,
Cast in thy mite.
