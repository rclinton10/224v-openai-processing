This humble bard knits brow and
thinks,
E'en as he drives and loudly honks
While easing through the crowded
Bronx.
"Ah! Sphinx," he cries, "I see at
length
That you're a word not unlike

Answer: I get more mail that way!
The last count was 99,476, but my

nothing but count all day.
San Bernardino: Colby, your pro-
nunciation of soldier, as "SOLE-jer"

it "SOLE-di-yer."
Answer: Um-m! What you said!
Frank Colby's leaflet, C-11, "Lie-Lay,

South said later that he would
have bid a grand slam if North
had been able to show three kings
over the Blackwood five-no-trump
call. It was unfortunate, however,
that South did not do better with
the excellent material in hand, at
the excellent contract.
West led the club jack. Win-
ning with the blank ace, South
drew trumps in two rounds, then
cashed the ace of diamonds. When
West showed out, declarer said dis-
gustedly, "What a break! Now we
need the spade finesse, partner."
Forthwith, he took that finesse, and
his disgust was doubled and re-
doubled when East smothered the
spade queen and laid down the
king of clubs. Down one!
As we said originally, the hand
could have been made in several
ways, but some of these would in-
volve the use of complicated end-
plays. The really simple way-so
simple that South should have been
ashamed to miss it-was to pro-
ceed as South did in respect to
drawing trumps and cashing a high
diamond, but, with the diamond
situation exposed, merely to lead
the club queen from dummy and,
when East covered with the king,
to give him the trick! What could
be more clear-cut than for South
to toss a spade or a diamond on
this gift and then challenge East
to make a return lead? A diamond

return would give dummy two
tricks in the suit, and a club return
would let South discard his last
loser while ruffing in dummy.

Human beings have two eyes, the
same as foxes, squirrels, rabbits,
wolves, bears and other furry ani-
mals. Reptiles, fish and birds also
are two-eyed.
The two-eyed rule spreads far and
wide through the animal kingdom,
but it is broken by many kinds of
insects. If insects had noses, we
might expect many of them to turn "PROBOSCIS-
up their noses at the idea of having
only two eyes apiece!
It is common for insects to have
four or five eyes! Two or three of
the eyes are on the top of the head,
and are known as "simple eyes."
The simple eyes seem to perform
only one service-they help to tell
the difference between light and
darkness.
The eyes which do most for an

at either side of an insect's head. These parts are known as "facets,"
When we study one of the large and each facet has six sides.

pass through color cells before they
reach nerves. The nerves carry the
"message" of what is seen to the
insect brain.
The number of facets in a com-
pound eye differs, according to the
kind of insect. Certain ants have
only about four dozen facets in each
eye.
The eye of a housefly has about
4,000 facets. That is a great number,
but some insects are far ahead of
the housefly. The swallowtail
butterfly, for example, has 17,000
facets in each eye. Above the
swallowtail is the convolvulus hawk
moth. This moth has 27,000 facets
in each compound eye!
