AIR FORCE TO CONVERT
ITS B-36 WINGS TO
B-52s SOON
Washington (AFPS)--
The Air Force will
begin a full-scale
conversion of its
heavy bomb wings to
B-52 jet bombers in
April, the Defense
Department said.
The wings now are
equipped with B-36s.
It was estimated
that the entire
changeover will take
"several years."
The 42nd Heavy Bomb
Wing at Loring AFB,
Maine, will be the
first of the new
units to get the
speedy Stratofor-
tress.
The AF said that as
the B-36s are re-
placed they will be
dismantled and used
as a source of
spare parts for
those remaining in
service. Some B-36
equipment is inter-
changeable and can
be used in other
aircraft.

U.S.S. BOXER TO
JOIN ANTI-SUBMARINE
FORCES
San Diego (AFPS)--
The carrier U.S.S.
BOXER, which rec-
ently completed
her seventh tour
in Far Eastern
waters, has arriv-
ed here for con-
version to an anti-
submarine-warfare
support ship.
The Navy said high
speed jets now
aboard the 27,000
ton flattop will
be replaced with
slower propeller
type planes better
suited for sub-
marine defense pur-
poses.
The BOXER is ex-
pected to be ready
to rejoin the
Pacific Fleet next
July (1956).
The Navy Nurse
Corps was es-
tablished in
1908.
West Point is
153 years old.
