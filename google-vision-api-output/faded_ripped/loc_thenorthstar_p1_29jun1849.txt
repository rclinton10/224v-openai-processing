turned, after three weeks' sujourn in
Paris, wihther we were deputed to go
by the London Committee, in order to
make the needful preliminary inquiries
and preparations for the Peace Con-
gress, intended to be held in that city
in the month of August. We were
met there by an earnest and zealous
fellow-laborer, M. Visschers, President
of the last Congress at Brussels, who
came as the representative of the Bel-
gian Committee, and who rendered us
the most valuable aid in our mission,
as did your estimable countryman Mr.
George Sumner. We were welcomed
on our arrival with the most earnest
cordiality by M. Bouvet, who procured
for us an immediate introduction to
M. Lamartine. We felt, from the
first moment, when it was proposed to
hold the Congress at Paris, that in no
way could our object be so effectually
subserved, as by enlisting the sympa-

the best possible exercise. Habituate
yourself to walk very far. The Euro-
peans value themselves on having sub-
dued the horse to the use of man; but
I doubt whether we have not lost more
than we have gained by this anim√°l
for no one thing has caused such de-
generacy of the human body. An In-
dian goes on foot nearly as far in a day
as an enfeebled white does on his horse,
and will tire the best horses. A little
walk of half an hour in the morning,
when you first rise, is advisable. It
shakes off sleep, and produces other
good effects in the animal economy.-

another nature. These are to be
found in the clearness of vision which

that they have attained to the know-

the word of salvation, and they hold it

the altar of their God! They sell their

to those whom they know will work and

without the temptation of hunger or
