the African regard to the immunity of a man's house,
that it styles it his castle, and will never
suffer it to be violated with impunity. For
this reason, no outward doors can be broken
open to execute any civil process."
As no fugitive slave is arrested on a crimi-
nal but a civil process-not as a felon but a
chattel personal-it follows that the inmates
of the house so ruthlessly invaded by Gor-
such and his ruffian associates were legally
justified in making deadly resistance.-Lib
erator. LIBERTY FOR SLAVEHOLDERS.-Mr. John
Cornutt, a citizen of Grayson County, Va., a
Virginian and Slaveholder, had somehow
imbibed the " fanatical" notion, that it is
wrong to hold human beings as chattlels, to
deny them any education, to force them to
work all their lives for a rude subsistence, to
flog them when they are slow, to sell wives
away from husbands and children from
mothers, and to kill any who dare resist the
master's will. In short, Mr. Cornutt, though
surrounded from birth with all the blessings
of the "patriarchal institution," had become
such a "fanatic" that he could not perceive
them-a blindness which impels us to appre-
hend that he has not been a regular reader
of "The New York Express for the Union."
Whereupon, while he is quietly at work on
his farm, a mob surrounds him, and demands
that he shall "renounce his Abolition senti-
ments." He cannot do it-he might as well ments." He cannot do it-he might as well
renounce the sun's shining. So they pro-
ceed to strip him, tie him to a tree and whip
him until he is frightened and tortured into
asssenting to anything they exact, even to
his own exile from the State. "And the
Committee is off in pursuit of others."
Such is the liberty enjoyed by citizens and
slaveholders in democratic Virginia, which
cherishes so profound a horror of the Alien
and Sedition laws. We make a great ado
(unreasonably) about Italian despotism, but
wherein is it more atrocious than this?-N
Y. Tribune. A lady has recently been made a
member of the Legion of Honor in France, Brow of our civil insti-
tutions-when this wandering vagrant and
heartless demogogue was making his slimy
trail towards the city of Rochester and
through Western New York, we held him up
to the scorn and contempt of our country-
men, and cautioned the unwary to avoid him
as they would the pestilence. For doing this,
which was no more than any honest citizen,
who has the love his country at heart, and
who feels tenacious of its honor, is bound to
do, we were recklessly and bitterly assailed
by the abolition factionists and factious abo-
lition whig presses, and charged with the
design to raise a mob to put down the British
Emissary by brute force. Our readers may
recollect how awful these mock philanthro
pists affected to be shocked at the idea of
using mob law to put down even a med-
dling foreign Emissary-these patent saints
were shocked at the idea that the law and
order of our quit city were to be disturbed,
for the purpose of driving out of our midst.
by force, a wretch who was plotting the sub-
version of our Liberties, and stirring up the
ignorant and thoughtless to mutiny and re-
bellion
Our readers will also recollect how false
and groundless were these charges against
us of attempting to excite our people to any
overt act of violence-that we deprecated
all resort to illegal force or mob violence, and
warned the honest, well-meaning, yet impul-
sive spirits, who could scarcely restrain their
indignation, to beware and not place these
conspirators in the attitude of persecuted
martyrs, even to a bad cause. And these
better counsels prevailed-our staid, reputa
ble citizens suffered these insane railers
against our country and our laws to rail on
unmolested, and to depart with naught save
the contempt of all honest men to stamp
their infamous conduct as it deserved. And
still we were assailed by these vindictive
saints, as having been guilty of the foul de-
sign of stirring up the public to mob violence
The scenes have changed-and those who
affected to be so shocked at the idea of mob
law, have now thrown off all disguise, and
revealed themselves in their true light as
mobocrats, and conspirators against the lawn Edward S. Smith

and his Costermonger constituency, and came
over to his country to teach the natives phil-
anthrophy and the principles of liberty and
good Government, by assailing our institu-

our clergy and our religious institutions,
