UNITED STATES INFIRMARY,
Corner of 9th and E streets, adjoining the Methodist Pro-
Restant Church, ( Rev. Mr. Webster's, ) opposite the Rev
( B. Brown's residence, about eighty yards from the new
General Post Ofice, Washington City.
TR. BENJAMIN THOMSON, the Founder of the
Thomsonian Botanic Infirmaries in Boston, Massa-
chuset:s, and Concord, N. H., and more recently from the
: tate of Virginia, having long had a desire to establish an
Infirmary in this Metropolis, takes this method of infor-
ming the public that he has gratified that cesire, and has
titted up in a style unprecedented in this city (or perhaps
any other except his Infirmary at Concord, N. H., which
has been pronounced the most perfect one in the work)
the above desirable house, on the same plan with his In-
firmaries in the East and South, where his paticuts can
depend on such treatment as their infirmities may demand.
To my friends, and the friends of the system, I need
but say that I am here. They have, no doubt. seen my
prospectuses and my practice opcion of, in all the Thom.
sonian periodicals in the United States, and my unprece-
dented success in the places where I have heretofore proc-
tised. The system is still progressing with rapid strides,
and producing a complete revolution in the medical world.
For the benefit of the public, Dr. T. gives the ol-
towing extracts, relative to his practice in the places
where he has established infirmaries :
BOSTON .- Extract from Advertisement: - " Since April,
1832, un to May, 1834, be has administered upwards of
two thousand courses of Medicine to more than fifteen
hundred patients, visiting from six rods to six hundred
miles distant, in almost every stage of disease, the greater
part of whom have been cured. Patients given over to
die at the New York, Philadelphia, Massachusetts, New
Brunswick, and Ingane hospitals, have been cured at my
Infirmaries. ONE, and only one death, has occurred at
mny Infirmary, since i's establishment ; and $1000 is her.
offered to any individual who will prove to the contrary;
al-o. $1000 to any individual who will prove as great an
amount of business to have been accomplished during the
same time at any hospital in Europe or America, with
the occurrence of a less number of deaths and more cures."
CONCORD .- Extract from a Letter to a United States
Senator, dated January 1, 1835 -" DEAR SIR :-- There
appears to be considerable excitement here at pre-
sent
*
A new era seems to have com-
*
menced in medical science. Dr. Thompson has indeed
done wonders in the healing art. He has performed
cuves in the absence of all hope of patients, friends and
regular physicians. Of the many cases he has had, a
few have come to my knowledge which justice compels
me to mention.
" A young gentleman who had been out of health for
several years, and who I understand was at the Iafirma-
ry the same time you was, and in consequence of your
advice took one course of medicine, declared, as I am
informed, that he received more reliefin 15 minutes, un-
der the operation of the Botannic Medicines, than he had
before for four years, when under the charge of the most
eminent physicians of the State ; a few days after he
took another course and was cured A gentleman by the
name of Marden from Chichester, who had been affliet.
ed with dyspepsia and all its attendant train of evils for
several years, came to the Infirmary with the intention
of remaining one week, and was, agreeably to his own
declaration, cured in one day, and was enabled to return
to his family the third day after he left them, a well man.
This case, I understand, has caused consi lerable excite-
ment in Chichester and the neighboring towns. A young
lady-a deplorable case of mental derangement-cured in
one fortnight. A lady from Loudon, who, at the age of
seven years, suffered severely from a paralytic shock,
after which she was affected with fits and falling sickness
for 25 years, and was attended, without any benefit, by 17
regular physicians, came to the Infirmary, took 2 courses
of medicine, and was enabled to make a hearty meal of
animal food, of which she had not been able even to taste
for ten years, remains well, and able to labor at the pre-
sent time.
"Dr. Thomson's success in fevers has indeed been
great. He has taken patients from almost all the regular
physicians here, and restored them to health in a few
hours, although some of them were thought to be dange.
1ously sick by their friends and medical attendants, and
no prospect of recovering under six or eight weeks, if
they did at all."
PETERSBURG, VA -Extract from Certificate .- "We, the
undersigned, do hereby certify, with much pleasure, that
we have visited the Thomsonian Infirmary, recently es-
tablished in Petersburg, on the Thomsonian plan, and
believe that no one is better calculated to do it justice.
and to help the afflicted, than Dr. Thomson. We have
taken his medicines, and have seen them repeatedly given
with manifest advantage, in a number of cases where the
patients were quite ill. His peculiar manner of mixing
them goes to make them agreeable and palatable, and his
seeming skill in timing and proportioning the doses to
the age and strength of the patient and disease, met our
warmest admiration. His vapor and medicated baths are
truly luxurious, and are given in the most delicate and
agreeable way, and are perfec ly understood by the female
attendants, under the direction of Mrs Anson and Doctor
Thomson. The whole process, from what we have seen
and experienced, may be undergone by the most timid
Jady or delicate child, without the least apprehension of
danger in any point of view : on the contrary, with much
advantage, when it is needed. We would recommend
all the afflicted to the Thomsonians, and to the Petersburg

ing rheumatic affections, mercurial diseases, &c. it may

ret rersdies, as Swaim's, Potter's, &c and is recom-
