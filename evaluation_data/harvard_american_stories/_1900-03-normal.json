For the past two or three years\nhe has been very much interested in de-\nveloping dairies along the Central. In\nthe first article on 1.-The Dairy Herd II\nIs stated that the cattle must be good\nand of the quality suited to the work.\nThe farm should be specially adapted to\nthe branch of husbandry in view. A good\ndairy farm is pretty certain to be a good\nfarm for other uses. but many good farms\nin general are not suited to dairying. The\ncharacter of the accessible markets and\nthe means of communication should be\ncarefully studied.\n\n\nThe farmer need not seek far to find\nthe best kind of cows for milk or butter\nmaking, or the best for the cream trade.\nDairymen are advised not to buy at once\na full stock of fullbred cattle of any\nbreed as that would require q large In\nvestment; well bred and well selected\ncows of the line of breed desired seem to\nbe the most profitable for the practical\ndairy, or at least the best to begin with\n1t Is better to pay $500 for three excellent\nCOWS than to pay the same for four good\ncows or five which are only fair Good\ndairy cows deserve good care.

He says that he has some muSh\nsugar, of which he expects to carry a SAM\npie on his next rip TO Savannah to show\nthe sugar men what ii is like. This mush\nsugar is richer i'll saccharine matter than\nany other form of crude sugar, and Its\nyield in refining Is correspondinGly high.\n\n\nDuring the war the judge learned TO\nmake u good quality OF white sugar with\nonly a very slight brown sugar taste.\nThe sirup was boiled until 1t \"blubbered''\nall over showing that it had reached the\npoint of crystalliZation, when certain\namount of fresh well wate- was added.\nThis caused a second scum to rise, which\nwhen skinned oft left a perfectly pure\nsaccharine solution, and this gave a white\nsugar. lie afterwards learned that tho\nloaf sugar In universal use forty years\nago was made I'm precisely the same man.\nncr. lie asserted that this was not caus-\ncd by limo or other mineral properties of\nthe water acting as a clarifying agent.\nas he had used rain water with the same\nsuccess.\n\n\nAs to the future of the melon growing\nindustry, once u remunerative one for\nsouth Georgia, he declared it is practical\nly a thing of the past.

Inc\nlatter gentleman said that capitalists IN\nhis section would not for moment con-\nslider any proposition to come south ana\nengage in cotton raising, but that IL 'he\nfigures given by him are correct they\nwould invest in the raising OF sugar caiie'\nand the manufacture of sirup ana SuSui +.\n~ SLs Of his articles the judge stated\nthat tho sugar beet requires close cuiti-\nwalton. the average being aboIt an aero\nto the family. while cane requires very\nlittle cultivation, and has yielded in more\nthan one instance in this county 6Oo sa-\nIons of sirup to the acre. which at 40\ncents-a moderate price-would give $40\ngross return.\n\n\nTwenty dollars per acre he considers a\nliberal allowance for all expenses, leav-\ning 500 per acrN net profit, which Spells\nprosperity, while and Scent cotton\nmeans ruin HIS articles show that the\nsaccharine coeflicient of south Georgia\ncane is much larger than that OF Louis\nlana, and he accounts for this by stating\nthat Louisiana cane Is grown on low,\nmarshy land. where an excess OF moiS-\nture is taken up in growth. His iIlvesti-\ncations haze shown that south florida\ncane is richer in saccharine matter than\nany known. three gallons OF juice yield\ning one gallon of sirup of standard densi-\nty; the cane of this portion of the state\nruns about six gallons of juice to one or\nSirup. He says that he has some muSh\nsugar, of which he expects to carry a SAM\npie on his next rip TO Savannah to show\nthe sugar men what ii is like. This mush\nsugar is richer i'll saccharine matter than\nany other form of crude sugar, and Its\nyield in refining Is correspondinGly high.\n\n\nDuring the war the judge learned TO\nmake u good quality OF white sugar with\nonly a very slight brown sugar taste.\nThe sirup was boiled until 1t \"blubbered''\nall over showing that it had reached the\npoint of crystalliZation, when certain\namount of fresh well wate- was added.\nThis caused a second scum to rise, which\nwhen skinned oft left a perfectly pure\nsaccharine solution, and this gave a white\nsugar. lie afterwards learned that tho\nloaf sugar In universal use forty years\nago was made I'm precisely the same man.\nncr. lie asserted that this was not caus-\ncd by limo or other mineral properties of\nthe water acting as a clarifying agent.\nas he had used rain water with the same\nsuccess.\n\n\nAs to the future of the melon growing\nindustry, once u remunerative one for\nsouth Georgia, he declared it is practical\nly a thing of the past. With the state Of\nTexas one great melon field. and reaching\nthe great cities of the middle west on a\nrate of from forty to fifty dollars per car\nless than We can command. the industry\nIs doomed.
