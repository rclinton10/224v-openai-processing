AS tHis iS INe mOSt VsO\"1ANa oa all diseases which infest the country, the humanely generOns proprietor of the American Medical Recorder, will pardon the intimation of theme for one of his annual prize essays. Vaccination demonstrates that the prevention as we'll as the cure of diseases belongs not inap- propriately the medical art. ...s\n\n A distinguished physician has mentioned the use of tobacco as one cause Of intem- perance, since it vitates the taste and ren- ders the most natural, simple and whole some drinks unpaltable. Parents should therefore seasonably and earnestly dis- suade their children from an unnecessary use of it. The prepossesslons and an- tipatIlies of children are easily formed and rendered durable. Mothers especially should be reminded of the vast importance of instilling into the minds of their tender offspring love of natural simplicity and temperance should teach them to abhor and resist firmly yet courteously the noxious superAuities which fashion prescribes, should inspire them with perpetual jealousy of the first approaches of iHtemperance, should disclose to them the afluring insiduousness of its beginnings, only to bite at last like a serpent and sting like an adder, should fill them with dread of tippling houses, those suburbs. of hell, and should stamp their re- tentjve memories with views as awful, if possible ,as reality of the tremendous conse- quences of yielding in the least to this pow erty-creating, healtIl-ruining, soul-damning sin. But after all that can ba done by the friends of temperance to excite parents to perform this duty to their ofisprings, many will neglect it. To remedy, in some de- gree, this neglect, teachers of common and other schools should be encouraged to ad- dress the children and youth, whose nor als and manners are committed to their care, on. this awfally interesting theme to hold up for their imitation the temper ance of the father of his country, and the shining examples of eminently good men of past ages,and Illustrate with affectionate\n\n earnestness at least every week inc advan- tages of sobricty, and the wretchedness of intemperance. And it seems not unwor- thy of legislative dignity to dictate a fa- miliar and pertinent address to the rising hope of the community relative to this mo- mentuous subject, a subject in which their welfare and that of the state are a. like deeply involved, and require instruc- ters either to place it in their hands, or to read it to them statedly. For our youth are caught by the monster of intemper- { ante in vast numbers like fishes in net, not dreaming that danger is nigh till they are unable to escape. ---..\n\n Agricultural societies might promote the\n\n object by proposing premiums for farms\n\n which are cultivated without the use of ar-\n\n dent spirits. As drunkenness does not\n\n exist where the vine fourishes, its cultiva-\n\n ton is especially worthy of their attention\n\n and thatof other patriotic associations and\n\n individuals. Our climate and soil are SC\n\n various that the culture of it would at least\n\n in some sections, be attended with highly probable success. It may be well to re-\n\n fleet that only a few years since, eight bags of cotton, which article now constitutes the\n\n chief staple of our country, were seized ig\n\n Liverpool as product not of American 1 growth. The currant thrives and bears we'll in most parts of the Republic, and as the wines an auxiliary oftemperance, and in general good substitute for ardent spir- its, it ought be more cultivated. Fruits of every kind ought 10 be cultivated, because they are friendly to temperance, and tend to cherish a natural taste perhaps as pow erfully as the poisonous plant before men, toned tends to prevent it. The love of fruit is not generally united with thirst for ardent spirits\n\n Agreater number, and far greater vari- esy Ofracts on this subject ought to be put IntO circulation. They should be ad pic ed and addressed to every class of the com mUairy, especially to its younger mem- berS- The English to resist the invasion of the Spanish armada dispersed plates and pictures of the instruments of torture which were said to have been on board of it. History informs us of a people, who occasionally took their children to see slave in a state of intoxication, that they might imbibe strong aversion to it from so odious sight. Tract societies might publish representations of the effect of ardent spirits, annexing brief notices in prose and poetry descriptive, perceptive, or satirical. These if rightly conducted might induce just and inextinguishable antipathy in the minds of thousands of children against an improper use of intox- icating liquors.\n\n The prevention of intemperance is a",

The assumption is gratuitous. Where did the oress ever save nation The press, like every thing else in this country speaks the mind of the people, and is under their control. It has no power but such as the people give it. Its agency depends on their volition. How then can it reform nation unwilling to be reformed How can it give sobriety to the most intemper- ate people that ever existed How much longer. how much more must it increase before the press begins to, exert its re- straining energy How much lower must we descend in the scale of national degra- dationebefore we feel its elevating power If the press had not hitherto exerted with effect its controlling agency, what pledge ? can it give that it will hereafter do it /? If this engine was intellectual at first to pre- vent or repair the breach, how can it re- store the foundations which as the current of intemperance- grows stronger are every year more and more swept away ? The press has not been adequate to the control, much less will it be to the extirpation of the evil. If it does not stay us in our downward course, what rational hope does it afford of efficiency to recoverthis nation from its degenerate condition to its pris- tine temperance ,and the presentinhabitants, or their prosterity, to the health, corporial vigor, and longevity, oftheir forefathers !!

AS tHis iS INe mOSt VsO\"1ANa oa all diseases which infest the country, the humanely generOns proprietor of the American Medical Recorder, will pardon the intimation of theme for one of his annual prize essays. Vaccination demonstrates that the prevention as we'll as the cure of diseases belongs not inap- propriately the medical art. ...s\n\n A distinguished physician has mentioned the use of tobacco as one cause Of intem- perance, since it vitates the taste and ren- ders the most natural, simple and whole some drinks unpaltable. Parents should therefore seasonably and earnestly dis- suade their children from an unnecessary use of it. The prepossesslons and an- tipatIlies of children are easily formed and rendered durable. Mothers especially should be reminded of the vast importance of instilling into the minds of their tender offspring love of natural simplicity and temperance should teach them to abhor and resist firmly yet courteously the noxious superAuities which fashion prescribes, should inspire them with perpetual jealousy of the first approaches of iHtemperance, should disclose to them the afluring insiduousness of its beginnings, only to bite at last like a serpent and sting like an adder, should fill them with dread of tippling houses, those suburbs. of hell, and should stamp their re- tentjve memories with views as awful, if possible ,as reality of the tremendous conse- quences of yielding in the least to this pow erty-creating, healtIl-ruining, soul-damning sin. But after all that can ba done by the friends of temperance to excite parents to perform this duty to their ofisprings, many will neglect it. To remedy, in some de- gree, this neglect, teachers of common and other schools should be encouraged to ad- dress the children and youth, whose nor als and manners are committed to their care, on. this awfally interesting theme to hold up for their imitation the temper ance of the father of his country, and the shining examples of eminently good men of past ages,and Illustrate with affectionate\n\n earnestness at least every week inc advan- tages of sobricty, and the wretchedness of intemperance. And it seems not unwor- thy of legislative dignity to dictate a fa- miliar and pertinent address to the rising hope of the community relative to this mo- mentuous subject, a subject in which their welfare and that of the state are a. like deeply involved, and require instruc- ters either to place it in their hands, or to read it to them statedly. For our youth are caught by the monster of intemper- { ante in vast numbers like fishes in net, not dreaming that danger is nigh till they are unable to escape. ---..\n\n Agricultural societies might promote the\n\n object by proposing premiums for farms\n\n which are cultivated without the use of ar-\n\n dent spirits. As drunkenness does not\n\n exist where the vine fourishes, its cultiva-\n\n ton is especially worthy of their attention\n\n and thatof other patriotic associations and\n\n individuals. Our climate and soil are SC\n\n various that the culture of it would at least\n\n in some sections, be attended with highly probable success. It may be well to re-\n\n fleet that only a few years since, eight bags of cotton, which article now constitutes the\n\n chief staple of our country, were seized ig\n\n Liverpool as product not of American 1 growth. The currant thrives and bears we'll in most parts of the Republic, and as the wines an auxiliary oftemperance, and in general good substitute for ardent spir- its, it ought be more cultivated. Fruits of every kind ought 10 be cultivated, because they are friendly to temperance, and tend to cherish a natural taste perhaps as pow erfully as the poisonous plant before men, toned tends to prevent it. The love of fruit is not generally united with thirst for ardent spirits\n\n Agreater number, and far greater vari- esy Ofracts on this subject ought to be put IntO circulation. They should be ad pic ed and addressed to every class of the com mUairy, especially to its younger mem- berS- The English to resist the invasion of the Spanish armada dispersed plates and pictures of the instruments of torture which were said to have been on board of it. History informs us of a people, who occasionally took their children to see slave in a state of intoxication, that they might imbibe strong aversion to it from so odious sight. Tract societies might publish representations of the effect of ardent spirits, annexing brief notices in prose and poetry descriptive, perceptive, or satirical. These if rightly conducted might induce just and inextinguishable antipathy in the minds of thousands of children against an improper use of intox- icating liquors.\n\n The prevention of intemperance is a",

The assumption is gratuitous. Where did the oress ever save nation The press, like every thing else in this country speaks the mind of the people, and is under their control. It has no power but such as the people give it. Its agency depends on their volition. How then can it reform nation unwilling to be reformed How can it give sobriety to the most intemper- ate people that ever existed How much longer. how much more must it increase before the press begins to, exert its re- straining energy How much lower must we descend in the scale of national degra- dationebefore we feel its elevating power If the press had not hitherto exerted with effect its controlling agency, what pledge ? can it give that it will hereafter do it /? If this engine was intellectual at first to pre- vent or repair the breach, how can it re- store the foundations which as the current of intemperance- grows stronger are every year more and more swept away ? The press has not been adequate to the control, much less will it be to the extirpation of the evil. If it does not stay us in our downward course, what rational hope does it afford of efficiency to recoverthis nation from its degenerate condition to its pris- tine temperance ,and the presentinhabitants, or their prosterity, to the health, corporial vigor, and longevity, oftheir forefathers !! The press reveals the past not the future. 1t makes no promises. Much less c0n it promise to protect and preserve nation increasingly incorporate. If this nation so continues, and yet preserves it's liberties and its privileges, it will be an anomaly in history. Such an event is in opposition to all past experience. But ifsthe press be in truth friendly to- the perpetuity of our institutions, and really hostile to this iniquitious pestilence which vastly more endangers them than Africo-American bay. onets,or than all the cannon of Europe,- fit be really willing to sound the alarm that shall ring through nations ears, let that tfriendship be evinced. Tell the great Emporium which expends, if her own statement be true $5 ,OOO daily to purchase wretchedness and pollution, and pow erty and crime, I--tell every Ameri- can from the Lake to the Gulf, from Bos- ton to the Missouri that persevcring in our present habits we shall be ruined ,-tha elegance in literature, and refinement ir the arts, did not save Greece, that ths wealth of the world could not save Rome, ,TH and that a happy form of gov. ernment will not save us without temper. ance demonstrate the absudity of apply ing, for defence against the militant ex tremcs of heat and cold to this Proteal god under whose supplying influence som, are every year leftsto be stiffned in fros or immolated in flames. Repeat till i cannot be forgotten what Plutarch ha. said, ''of all the destroyer of nerves healtt and life this is the greatest\" and I have g no doubt but it has broken down more constitutions, brought on more distempers and sent more people tO an early grave than all other vices of the world united and the memorable words of late sage, s'all the crimes on earth do not destroy so many of the HUMAN RACE, nor alieneate so much PROPERTY as drunkenness''*** Ex- pose the folly of building continually aims houses, poor--houses, hospitals, asylum refnges, bTidewells, treadmllls, prisons and pe1itenfisries, and of educating the rising generation to i'll them of laylshing mill- 5ous for the sws q tAs srsl. and of doing aaGaiug tn rgmave Gkr GaaEsg-\n\n LaE gs'aESamsn sf tze sar rsEeat wath the vuiEa Gf uiERadsu. wiazEr has been SGrs1 said tliGn & ulir,,ss-fs1ntis ef all the criases cos- mifrs,f ars through uhs mflIeucs of spiriIt- anuH EIglnrs,' ' S4 tms-rhrds of those now pHlperss ars made ss sy Eareuspersncs.

The evils he has done this country deserve not any redress but vengance. Let those guilty of Drunkenness undergo civ- il disabilities like that in Spain, where for merly man convicted of drunkenness was legally incapacitated to give testimony in a court of justice. Let every means be de- vised to pour contempt on intemperance, and let the bodies off the suicidal wretches, who persevsre, be delivered over for dis- section.
