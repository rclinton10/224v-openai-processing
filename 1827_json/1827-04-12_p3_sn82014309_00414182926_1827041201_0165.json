The Spring has opened upon us with all its loveliness at least fortnight earlier than usu- al. The fields are already covered with green, and all nature, animate and inanimate, seems to rejoice in the transition from deso- late winter to mild spring. The air is filled with the sweet melody of the birds, and all hearts-but such as are cruel enough to induce their pOssessOrs to level a fowling- piece against these happy aerial songsters-appear to rejoice in the benefcence of Providence in providing this cheering solace for the droop- ing spirits of man. While partaking of this rich profusion of blessings, we envy not the feelings of the individual who can wantonly destroy the innocent birds that sport upon our trees i've marvel at the coldness of fthat heart which can exult at the fatality of shot aimed at these beautiful harbingers of return ing spring. Does such spirit dwell in any individual who professes to be governed by the feelings and passions of man! It does {; | and many of the feathered tribe tarried but short time with us, rejoicing in the departure 1 of winter, before they were cruelty shot down simply in sport. In Massachusetts the strong arm of the law is raised against such wanton cruelty; here we have no civil law against it; but let public opinion speak, as it should speak upon the subject, and young men, professing to be gentlemen, will not be found engaged in such disgraceful conduct Let our ladies of taste and feeling frown upon the individual who IS willing to sport with the limbs and lives of the feathered tribe, and birds will rest secure and safe amidst the shades of our vil- lage.\n\n l A bridge near WallingfOrd, while the mail stage from Hartford was passing on the 1st fhst.gave way, ,and fell entirely into the stream.

For six years she has been the scene of slaughter and devastation. She has seen her cities burnt, the sacredness of her temples violated, the highest dignities of her church murdered, aud her fertile plains, vineyards, and olive groves devas- tated. She has seen her infrm and aged consumed by the flames her noblest sons fall ill her cause; her daughters dragged into cruel bondage; and her infants torn from their mothers breasts, dashed against the wall, or left to perish in uncultivated districts. All this she has repeatedly witt messed. Now she beholds her children na- ked and .famishing and with suppliant look, with outstretched arms, she turns to 1 this abode of freedom and virtue, and begs for the necessaries of life. She points you ] 10 her homeless thousands, her widows and orphans; she shows you her famishing warriors and enslaved virgins, and asks for asistance.-Will it be refused Is there a christian, is there an American, who can listen with indifference to her supplica- tions p\n\n The Rev. Samuel Spring was installed minister over the North Congregational Church in Hartford, on Wednesday the Fist inst. The introductory prayer was offered by the Rev. J. H. Fairchild of E. Hartford. The sermon, from James i. xviii. was delivered by the Rev. Dr. Spring, of New-York, Installation prayer by the Rev. Dr. Perkins of West Hartford, Charge by the Rev. MT. Penney of Wethersfeld. The Rev. Joel Hawes gave the right hand of fellowship. The concluding prayer was from the Rev. MT. Lindsley. It would be but tame expression to say that the per- formances were highly interesting. The solemn and earnest attention with which the eloquent sermon of Dr. Spring was lis- tened to, showed the intelligence of the au- dience, and by such an audience, the other exercises must have been deeply felt.\n\n Freshet.-On Thursday and Friday last, the water rose over the banks of the Connecticut river, higher than it has risen since 1907. The rise above the ordinary low water mark is more than twenty feet and notwithstanding the great surface of flats and meadows it must cover, it rose in Hartford at the rate of an inch an hour.- The great freshet of 1901, by which all subsequent ones have been guaged, was marked at twenty-six feet.

This treaty was made at GoOlstan in Karabaugh, and hopes were held out, that upon an appeal to the Emperor, apart Ofthe provinces would be restored and to effect this object England promised her good offices. But when the Persian embassy appeared at St. Petersburgh, although backed by the strenuous eXertions of Lord Cathcart then Ambassador to Russia, Alexander was found inexorable, and peremptorily refused to give back single inch of Persian soil. It was at length, however, agreed, that Gen. Yerma- IOf, who was then appointed Ambassador to Persia and Governor of Georgia, might dis cuss the matter when he arrived at the Per sian court. It is not, however, to be suppo- sed that the minister would yield what it was evident his sovereign had determined to keep. Nothing of course was done to appease the mortified Persians, and Gen. YermalofF re- turned to his government in Georgia, leaving Charge des Affairs. who was directed by the Shah to station himself at the Court of Abbas Mirza, the Prince Royal, whose claims to the throne Russia had engaged to support against all competitors whatever. Commis- sloncrs were then appointed to ascertain and define the boundary between the two nations according to the treaty of ofGoolistan.\n\n It may now be worth while to digress a lit- tie, in order to show what part was taken by Bonaparte during these transactions, who, it may easily be imagined, was not an inactive spectator, when war, conquests and kingdoms were concerned.\n\n There was no precise and defined connection between England and Persia until the mission of Sir John Malcolm to Tehran, in 1900, when political and commercial treaties were concluded, by which the Persians agreed to attack the Afghans, who then threatened the British possessions in India, and to exclude the French from the Gulf of Persia. But in 1905. Persia being hard pushed by Russia, and the Shah dazzled by the military renown ofBonoparte, applied to him for assistance.- M. Jaubert was immediately sent to Tehran to ascertain the state of things; he returned m l8O6, accompanied by MIrza Reza, on a special embassy. Mirza Reza saw Napoleon at Tilsit, and there concluded with him trea fy,whlch was formerly ratified at Finkenstein. m May, 1907. About the same time Persia sent mission to the British Government in India, to ask assistance, but the application was unsuccessful, and Persia then threw her. self into the arms of France.\n\n Bonaparte was as desrOus as Russia to sc- cure footing in Asia, having the additional stimulus ofthereby being enabled to menace the British possessions in the East. General Gardanne was charged with mission, and great number of presents, to the Shah, which, together with the failure of the application to the English, secured Gardanne splendid re- ceptlon at Tehran. and established for a time the supremacy of the Bonapartean power- England, at length, saw the error, which the combined effects of the death of Mir. Pitt the short, desuItory, and unsatisfactory reign ofMr. Fox and the Whig ministry-and sub sequentay, the uncertain state of the British relations with Russia, and the unwngness to do any thing that might turn the waverng policy of the latter towards France-had indu- ced her to commit. Sir Hartford Jones was accordingly sent to Persia in 1908, for the purpose Ofrestoring the old relations, and then began the competition between England and France for ascendancy in the councils of Per sia. From that moment may be dated the connexion of Persia with Europe, which has continued ever since, is still augmenting, and recent events clothe 1t with an aspect of ten fold importance.\n\n Nothing could equal the anxiety now felt, both in England and India for the result of this diplomatic contest. Europe lay pros trate at the feet of the usurper-the insurrec- tion in Spain was of doubtful character, and uncertain in its probable result-the spirit of South American Independence was only in it's bud-the United States were hostile, and Britain now saw her implacable enemy flush ed with victory and revelling in power, paving the way for wrestling from her, her empire in the East. It was trying moment-the dar- kest perhaps in heT history-but her good genius prevailed. A government of laws and religion, and nation of benefactors to the human race, were not destined by the Su- preme Dsposer of events, to crush beneath an unbridied desPot, whose power, notwith- standing his prodigious talents, sprung from infdelity and the guillotine.\n\n To assist Sir Hartford Jones, a mission of the greatest splcndor was despatched from India, accompanied by presents of the most costly description, and furnished with exten- sive powers. The result was most triumph ant for the British interests. The French in- fuence was completely supplanted, and that of the British re-established in its stead. A Persian Ambassador speedily arrived in Eng land, accompanied, we believe, by Sir George Ousely, with preliminary treaty, which be- ing duly ratified, defnitive treaty was af- rewards made and concluded, and immense presents again lavished on the Shah and his courtiers, to keep alive the friendly feelings thus happily created.\n\n Itwas under this treaty that England first paid Persia subsidy. 100000 tomans was the sum fixed upon for this purpose, and was to be paid during the continuance of the",

The Spring has opened upon us with all its loveliness at least fortnight earlier than usu- al. The fields are already covered with green, and all nature, animate and inanimate, seems to rejoice in the transition from deso- late winter to mild spring. The air is filled with the sweet melody of the birds, and all hearts-but such as are cruel enough to induce their pOssessOrs to level a fowling- piece against these happy aerial songsters-appear to rejoice in the benefcence of Providence in providing this cheering solace for the droop- ing spirits of man. While partaking of this rich profusion of blessings, we envy not the feelings of the individual who can wantonly destroy the innocent birds that sport upon our trees i've marvel at the coldness of fthat heart which can exult at the fatality of shot aimed at these beautiful harbingers of return ing spring. Does such spirit dwell in any individual who professes to be governed by the feelings and passions of man! It does {; | and many of the feathered tribe tarried but short time with us, rejoicing in the departure 1 of winter, before they were cruelty shot down simply in sport. In Massachusetts the strong arm of the law is raised against such wanton cruelty; here we have no civil law against it; but let public opinion speak, as it should speak upon the subject, and young men, professing to be gentlemen, will not be found engaged in such disgraceful conduct Let our ladies of taste and feeling frown upon the individual who IS willing to sport with the limbs and lives of the feathered tribe, and birds will rest secure and safe amidst the shades of our vil- lage.\n\n l A bridge near WallingfOrd, while the mail stage from Hartford was passing on the 1st fhst.gave way, ,and fell entirely into the stream.

This treaty was made at GoOlstan in Karabaugh, and hopes were held out, that upon an appeal to the Emperor, apart Ofthe provinces would be restored and to effect this object England promised her good offices. But when the Persian embassy appeared at St. Petersburgh, although backed by the strenuous eXertions of Lord Cathcart then Ambassador to Russia, Alexander was found inexorable, and peremptorily refused to give back single inch of Persian soil. It was at length, however, agreed, that Gen. Yerma- IOf, who was then appointed Ambassador to Persia and Governor of Georgia, might dis cuss the matter when he arrived at the Per sian court. It is not, however, to be suppo- sed that the minister would yield what it was evident his sovereign had determined to keep. Nothing of course was done to appease the mortified Persians, and Gen. YermalofF re- turned to his government in Georgia, leaving Charge des Affairs. who was directed by the Shah to station himself at the Court of Abbas Mirza, the Prince Royal, whose claims to the throne Russia had engaged to support against all competitors whatever. Commis- sloncrs were then appointed to ascertain and define the boundary between the two nations according to the treaty of ofGoolistan.\n\n It may now be worth while to digress a lit- tie, in order to show what part was taken by Bonaparte during these transactions, who, it may easily be imagined, was not an inactive spectator, when war, conquests and kingdoms were concerned.\n\n There was no precise and defined connection between England and Persia until the mission of Sir John Malcolm to Tehran, in 1900, when political and commercial treaties were concluded, by which the Persians agreed to attack the Afghans, who then threatened the British possessions in India, and to exclude the French from the Gulf of Persia. But in 1905. Persia being hard pushed by Russia, and the Shah dazzled by the military renown ofBonoparte, applied to him for assistance.- M. Jaubert was immediately sent to Tehran to ascertain the state of things; he returned m l8O6, accompanied by MIrza Reza, on a special embassy. Mirza Reza saw Napoleon at Tilsit, and there concluded with him trea fy,whlch was formerly ratified at Finkenstein. m May, 1907. About the same time Persia sent mission to the British Government in India, to ask assistance, but the application was unsuccessful, and Persia then threw her. self into the arms of France.\n\n Bonaparte was as desrOus as Russia to sc- cure footing in Asia, having the additional stimulus ofthereby being enabled to menace the British possessions in the East. General Gardanne was charged with mission, and great number of presents, to the Shah, which, together with the failure of the application to the English, secured Gardanne splendid re- ceptlon at Tehran. and established for a time the supremacy of the Bonapartean power- England, at length, saw the error, which the combined effects of the death of Mir. Pitt the short, desuItory, and unsatisfactory reign ofMr. Fox and the Whig ministry-and sub sequentay, the uncertain state of the British relations with Russia, and the unwngness to do any thing that might turn the waverng policy of the latter towards France-had indu- ced her to commit. Sir Hartford Jones was accordingly sent to Persia in 1908, for the purpose Ofrestoring the old relations, and then began the competition between England and France for ascendancy in the councils of Per sia. From that moment may be dated the connexion of Persia with Europe, which has continued ever since, is still augmenting, and recent events clothe 1t with an aspect of ten fold importance.\n\n Nothing could equal the anxiety now felt, both in England and India for the result of this diplomatic contest.
