He\nwas in the habit of receiving regular and\nlengthy reports from the agents of his es.\ntates in Virginia. and directed by letter the\nmanagement of these extensive establish\nments, with both consumate skill and sue\ncess He also inspected the weekly accounts\nand disbursements of his household in Phila-\ndelpha. Indeed, nothing seemed to es-\ncape the seeming mind of this wonderful\nman, \"who had time for all things, and did\nevery thing in its proper time\" and in order.\n\n\nGeneral Washington was practical econ-\nomist; while he wished that his style of liv-\ning should be fully in character with his ex-\nalted station, he was utterly averse to waste\nor extravaganza of any sort. He frequently\nreprimanded his first steward Francis, (the\nsame at whose hotel in New-York the Gem\neral in Chief took leave Of his brother Off\ncers.) for expenditures which appeared to\nbe both unnecessary and extrayagant Fran\nels once purchased shad fish at AN unusual\nseason; it was served up at the Presidents\nprivate table, who remarked that it was vel\nry early for such fish to be in the market.\nand demanded the price; the answer was,\nthree dollars. Washington waved his hand,\nand ordered, take it away, Sir; it must new\ner be said that my table sets an example of\nextravaganza. The mortified Steward re.\nmoved the rarity untouched.\n\n\nThe First President took considerable\npains, and used frequent stratagens, in en-\ndeavoring to avoid the numberless manifes.\ntations Of attachment and respect which a.\nwaited him wherever he went. On his Jour-\nneys, he charged the courier who would\nproceed to engage accommodations at the\ninns, by no means to mention the coming of\nthe President to other than the landlord.-\nThese precautions but rarely took effect.\nand often, when the Chief would suppose\nthat he had stolen a march upon his old\ncompanions in arms and fellow citizens, a\nhorseman would be discovered dashing off\nat ful speed, and soon would be heard the\ntrumpet of the volunteer cavalry, and the\nvillage cannon, reused from its bed of ne\nglect, where it had lain since warlike times.\nwould summon I'll within reach of its echoes,\nto haste and bid welcome to the man who\nwas \"frst in the hearts of his countrymen.\"\nEvery village and little hamlet poured forth\ntheir population to greet the arrival of him\nwhom all delighted to honor. A kind ofju-\nbilee attended every where the progress of\nthe Patriot Chief; for even the school chill\n\n\nlren, with the curiosity incident to that age\nof innocence, would labor hard at the daily\nlesson, and leave the birch to hang idly on\nthe wall, when to see Gencroi Washington\nwas the expected holiday and reward; and\nmany of these children, now the parents of\nchildren, while recalling the golden hours\nof infancy, will dwell with delight on the\ntime when they were presented to the Pa\nternal Chief, and recount how they heard\nthe kindly sounds of his voice; felt the kind\nlier touch of his hand; or climbed his knee,\nto \"share the good mans SMILE\" Pure.\nHAPPY and honored recollections! they will\ndescend like tradtionary lore from gener-\nalton to generation, venerable to all future\n| time.\n\n\nIn the frequent trial of generalship be-\ntween the Chief and his ancient comrades\nin arms-the one seeking to avoid the testi-\n\n\nmonies of respect and attachment, which the\n0ther was equally Stud1ouS TO oHer-tne latc\nColonel Proctor, gallant and distinguished\nofficer of Artillery, was several times OUT\ngeneralled-the President having reached\n\n\nthe Seat of Government privately and un-\n\n\nobserved. This reused the good old Colo\nmel, who declared, ale shall not serve me\n\n\nSO again; I'll warrant that my matches will\n\n\nbe found lighted next time\"\n\n\nSo soon as the first gun would be heard\n\n\nfrom the upper extremity of Market street,\n\n\nvenerable citizen was seen to leave his Of\n\n\nAce, and moving at more than his usual pace.\n\n\nascend the steps of the Presidolead He\n\n\ngave in no name; he required no ceremony\nof introduction, but, making his way to the\n\n\nfamily parlor, opened the general gratula-\n\n\nlation by the first welcome Of Robert Nor.\n\n\nris.\n\n\nAt the Ferry of the Susquehannah, lived\n\n\na veteran worthy of the Revolutionary day,\n\n\nwhere the President always took quarters\n\n\non ms JOURNEYS to and from his seat in Vir-\n\n\nr,nia.

He\nwas in the habit of receiving regular and\nlengthy reports from the agents of his es.\ntates in Virginia. and directed by letter the\nmanagement of these extensive establish\nments, with both consumate skill and sue\ncess He also inspected the weekly accounts\nand disbursements of his household in Phila-\ndelpha. Indeed, nothing seemed to es-\ncape the seeming mind of this wonderful\nman, \"who had time for all things, and did\nevery thing in its proper time\" and in order.\n\n\nGeneral Washington was practical econ-\nomist; while he wished that his style of liv-\ning should be fully in character with his ex-\nalted station, he was utterly averse to waste\nor extravaganza of any sort. He frequently\nreprimanded his first steward Francis, (the\nsame at whose hotel in New-York the Gem\neral in Chief took leave Of his brother Off\ncers.) for expenditures which appeared to\nbe both unnecessary and extrayagant Fran\nels once purchased shad fish at AN unusual\nseason; it was served up at the Presidents\nprivate table, who remarked that it was vel\nry early for such fish to be in the market.\nand demanded the price; the answer was,\nthree dollars. Washington waved his hand,\nand ordered, take it away, Sir; it must new\ner be said that my table sets an example of\nextravaganza. The mortified Steward re.\nmoved the rarity untouched.\n\n\nThe First President took considerable\npains, and used frequent stratagens, in en-\ndeavoring to avoid the numberless manifes.\ntations Of attachment and respect which a.\nwaited him wherever he went. On his Jour-\nneys, he charged the courier who would\nproceed to engage accommodations at the\ninns, by no means to mention the coming of\nthe President to other than the landlord.-\nThese precautions but rarely took effect.\nand often, when the Chief would suppose\nthat he had stolen a march upon his old\ncompanions in arms and fellow citizens, a\nhorseman would be discovered dashing off\nat ful speed, and soon would be heard the\ntrumpet of the volunteer cavalry, and the\nvillage cannon, reused from its bed of ne\nglect, where it had lain since warlike times.\nwould summon I'll within reach of its echoes,\nto haste and bid welcome to the man who\nwas \"frst in the hearts of his countrymen.\"\nEvery village and little hamlet poured forth\ntheir population to greet the arrival of him\nwhom all delighted to honor. A kind ofju-\nbilee attended every where the progress of\nthe Patriot Chief; for even the school chill\n\n\nlren, with the curiosity incident to that age\nof innocence, would labor hard at the daily\nlesson, and leave the birch to hang idly on\nthe wall, when to see Gencroi Washington\nwas the expected holiday and reward; and\nmany of these children, now the parents of\nchildren, while recalling the golden hours\nof infancy, will dwell with delight on the\ntime when they were presented to the Pa\nternal Chief, and recount how they heard\nthe kindly sounds of his voice; felt the kind\nlier touch of his hand; or climbed his knee,\nto \"share the good mans SMILE\" Pure.\nHAPPY and honored recollections! they will\ndescend like tradtionary lore from gener-\nalton to generation, venerable to all future\n| time.\n\n\nIn the frequent trial of generalship be-\ntween the Chief and his ancient comrades\nin arms-the one seeking to avoid the testi-\n\n\nmonies of respect and attachment, which the\n0ther was equally Stud1ouS TO oHer-tne latc\nColonel Proctor, gallant and distinguished\nofficer of Artillery, was several times OUT\ngeneralled-the President having reached\n\n\nthe Seat of Government privately and un-\n\n\nobserved. This reused the good old Colo\nmel, who declared, ale shall not serve me\n\n\nSO again; I'll warrant that my matches will\n\n\nbe found lighted next time\"\n\n\nSo soon as the first gun would be heard\n\n\nfrom the upper extremity of Market street,\n\n\nvenerable citizen was seen to leave his Of\n\n\nAce, and moving at more than his usual pace.\n\n\nascend the steps of the Presidolead He\n\n\ngave in no name; he required no ceremony\nof introduction, but, making his way to the\n\n\nfamily parlor, opened the general gratula-\n\n\nlation by the first welcome Of Robert Nor.\n\n\nris.\n\n\nAt the Ferry of the Susquehannah, lived\n\n\na veteran worthy of the Revolutionary day,\n\n\nwhere the President always took quarters\n\n\non ms JOURNEYS to and from his seat in Vir-\n\n\nr,nia.
