On the\n\n last day were bagged, in one coppice alone, $50 pheasants, 109 hares, and 116 rabbits;\n\n which with thirteen previous days sport,\n\n made grand total of 1000 head !-475\n\n head in one copse !! This is the kind of\n\n butchery which makes 1t necessary to SUD-\n\n port the game laws. The system destroys\n\n the true character of sporting, as well as\n\n the character of the peasantry.\n\n Last summer Mary Marshall, young\n\n woman of good character, was wedding in\n\n field, along with some other women,\n\n when they found nest containing some\n\n eggs. As they did not suppose that there\n\n was any crime in taking the eggs of wild\n\n bird, they agreed to divide them, and as\n\n she happened to have basket with her,\n\n they were put into it, and carried home\n\n when their labour was over. The cir\n\n cumstances coming to the knowledge of the game-keeper, he laid an information against her, and the poor girl finding she had committed an offence against the game laws, and fearful of the consequences, left her home, and went to Noting ham, where she was taken into the service of Mr. Swanwick, of the Kings Head Tavern. Here her conduct was quite in accordance with her previous good character, and in this situation she might have remained, with credit to herself, and to the entire satisfaction of her employer. But justice, it seems, was not satisfied; no expiation had been made for the horrible crime of taking two or three eggs found in the field; and the place C. her retreat being discov- cred, she was dragged from her comforta- ble situation, and being taken before the Rev. MT. Lowe, of Birmingham, and the Rev. Mir. Beaumont, of East Bridgeford, this respectable young woman was by them committed for three months to the South we'll House of Correction.\n\n Siege of Missolonghi.-A history of the siege of Missolonghi has been publish ed at Paris by M. Auguste Fabre. It contains number of most interesting de- tails with respect to that memorable event. The bravery and self-devotion of the unfortunate Greeks are painted with mas terly pencil. It is we'll known, that after having been disappointed in all hopes of aid, feeling the ramparts crumbling under their feet, seeing their fathers, their wives and their children, perishing by famine, the garrison sent communication to the only corps which was able to give them any succor, that of karaiskaki, requesting it to attack the rear ofthe enemy on csr- tain day, and to annouce it's arrival by a general discharge of musketry, at which moment the garrison would make a sortie, and endeavor to cut their way through the besieging army. On the appointed day the population of Missolonghi was assem- bled. There remained three thousand soldiers, (including those, who, although sick or wounded, were capable of march ing with the assistance of their comrades) a thousand arifcers or other men unused to fighting, and above five thousand wo- men and children. The Grecian women who fancied themselves strong enough to brave the danger and fatigue of the sortie, dressed themselves in mems clothes, in or der that ifthey were unable to escape the enemy, they might be mIstahe, for soldiers aud put to death instantly. Many ofthem hung round their necks and round the necks of their children, as protecting ta- lisman, the revered relics of their ances- tors, and wore concealed daggers, with which either to strike the enemy, or to se- cure their not being taken alive. Those whose weakness forbade them to follow the troops, joined the desperately wounded, the sick, the aged, and the infants, and re- solved to bury themselves in the ruins of the town. It was terrible moment. AL most all the families of Missolonghi were divided into two parts those who remain ed in expectation of death, and those who were on the point of rushing forth to ven- geance and to new dangers. The hardest warriors were subdued to tears and the bravest hearts quailed at the approaching separation. All these preparations were, however, rendered abortive by the infa- nous treachery ofa Bulgarian soldier, who had deserted to Ibrahim, and disclosed the whole plan. The Turks suddenly attack ed the town and bathed themselves in Christian blood.\n\n The scene that followed was hideous \"But one voice was heard among tt1e- des- vonoep g aavs M Eahro. To the",

It is as well known, that the French, like ourselves, ,have their Greek\n\n Committees, who detest the Pacha, and\n\n raise subscriptions to drive his forces from\n\n Europe. Among the former is General\n\n Count Livron, who enjoys the confidence\n\n of the Egyptian Chief; and among the\n\n latter is M.de Trone,a a respectable mem-\n\n Der of the Paris bar-an ardent lover of\n\n freedom and Greece. Count Livron, a\n\n few months ago, arrived at Marseilles to\n\n recruit for the Pacha, when M. de Trone,\n\n hearing of his arrival and the object of his\n\n visit, sent him message to the following\n\n purport: that he (de Trone) was anxious to do something for the freedom of Greece that his delicate health and domestic av- ocations would not permit him to 90 and fight its enemies on the Greek soil-and that he was therefore obliged to select one ot them nearer home, who disgraced the name of Frenchman, by joining it with that of a renegade. M. de Trone conclu- ded by asking the Count to tell him when 1t would be convenient for him that he should come to Marseilles to meet him. Livron answered that M. de Trone need not give himself the trouble of travelling to Marseilles, as he (Liyron) was about to set out for Paris, where he would let him hear from him immediately OH his arrival. The Count did indeed soon arrive, and mentioned the extraordinary challenge to some of his friends, who wishing to play upon his feelings or to try his firmness, represented de Trone as formidable an- tagonist, who had already in duels sealed the fate of several of his adversaries. Li- vron, as being the challenged party ,had the choice of weapons, and wishing to place himself on something like an equality with so noted parsonage, proposed that they should fight with swords on horse- back.\n\n De Trone, though he had never fought in his lifetime with any kind of weapons ,on horseback or on foot, was obliged to ac- cept of this tournament with cavalry off, cer. They accordingly went .out to St. Ouens, village in the neighborhood of Paris, with their respective seconds. We shall not stop to describe how these cham pions of the Greeks and Egyptians were accoutred-how they prepared for the combat,and what hopes and fears animated the bosom of each. Suffice it to say that the righteous cause prevailed-that the cavalry officer was unhorsed by the lawyer ---and that the count arma togG was ex- empli6ed in favor of Greece.\n\n ",

Since his confinement here he has been ao'ltulty dumb for three years Fomteem d0ys he abstained from all nouriShment, and being visited on the 14th day of his fasting, he was found so weak and emacia- ted as to be unable to raise himself in bed, and on being asked if he would take some food, he replied, \"brmg me pint of rum /\" On this day, however, he took nourishment and soon regained his former strength. Whether he was sick during that time is unknown, as he made no com plaint to that effect, but he undoubtedly intended to terminate his existence by starvation, being under the influence of his most malignant temper. Since that time he frequently abstaihed from food during three, four and five days at a time Tobacco is almost his only solace, and when he cannot obtain this, he substitutes for it straw taken from his bed. He never willingly changes or slaves himself, conse- quently the jail-keeper, semi-annuaIly, strips, washes and slaves him by force, and places on him clean clothing. During this operation, last year, he made an attempt to assass;nate the jail-keep- CT, with chisel which he had concealed in his bed. Fortunately his deadly aimed blow was in part warded off; the chisel, however, entered his ear and nearly stun ned him, but his assistants being near, they rescued him and restored order.

Times.\n\n Mechanical Ingenuity.--A distinguished mechanic of this place has made very el- egant and curious door-lock. <. It hasstwo bolts and two keys, which, to common observer, exactly resemble; each other. One of the keys commands but one bolt the other commands both /; to the bolt cnT pJ cd hx, tho :. ed an alarm bell, which makes very loud sound whenever the bolt is thrown back. There is but one key-hole to the lock; and the owner might safely give the lock, which cost several months labour, to a stranger, who could lock and unlock both\n\n bolts i'll ten hours time by the aid of both Keys. 1t is at thessame time very simple, and person may. in few minutes be in- structed in tho entire command over it. The inventor dedicated this piece of splendid mechanism to HENRY CLAY, the distin- guishcd friend and promoter of home in- dustry. The lock can be seen at the shop of MT. Simon Hickey, of this town..

Letter from Dr. Howe to a gentleman in\n\n this vicinity, 25 days later than that\n\n which was published on Tuesday.\n\n Steam Ship Kalerio, Swo, Dec. IS, 1926.\n\n Sir-My last was from Samos, dated Nov 22, about some days, after performing this, without falling in with any enemy, returned here, on the 9th, and I am now able to inform you of many things, of which was then ignorant, or which have occurred since. Athens holds out and will hold out !; the rainy season has com menced, and must every day make the situation of the enemy worse. The gar- rison well supplied with all necessaries, and we are under no apprehension for the place. Culuckis Pasllaw met with sev- were loss, the other day, in an affair with karraskikas. This commander, as I in- formed you, had changed his plan to that of openly attacking the enemy upon the plain of Athens, to that of cutting off his supplies from distancc--He had taken a post for this purpose, when body of 1900 Turks, sent out by Cutuckis. had advanced almost to Salona. He fol- lowed them up, attacked them in defile, killed 800, and forced the remainder to shut themselves up in Venetian chateau, almost without provisions sand he now holds them in blockade.\n\n Tbrahim Pasha remains, with his rem nant of an army, at Trippolizza, entirely inactive and probably very weak though learn with sorrow, that 20 transport ves- sels, laden with provisions and supplies, have arrived safely at Navarin. No troops however, have been brought him, and this confirms, what has been for a long time suspected, that the Pasha of Egypt is hardly in state to support the troops he now has in the Morea, much less to send fresh ones.\n\n The expedition of Colletti to. Euboea has failed: hoping to find the Turks off their guard, he landed and attacked them. But it appears he was perfectly prepared for and expected;-they fought, the Turks beat them back and drove them on board their ships. Thus ends the expedition of Colletti-from which had hoped son,e- thing, for he is decidedly man of talent, and his plan was good one; but it was miserably supplied with funds, and too cripple in means, to enable a general to eXcCute a deSiun with secrecv and das-",

But justice, it seems, was not satisfied; no expiation had been made for the horrible crime of taking two or three eggs found in the field; and the place C. her retreat being discov- cred, she was dragged from her comforta- ble situation, and being taken before the Rev. MT. Lowe, of Birmingham, and the Rev. Mir. Beaumont, of East Bridgeford, this respectable young woman was by them committed for three months to the South we'll House of Correction.\n\n Siege of Missolonghi.-A history of the siege of Missolonghi has been publish ed at Paris by M. Auguste Fabre. It contains number of most interesting de- tails with respect to that memorable event. The bravery and self-devotion of the unfortunate Greeks are painted with mas terly pencil. It is we'll known, that after having been disappointed in all hopes of aid, feeling the ramparts crumbling under their feet, seeing their fathers, their wives and their children, perishing by famine, the garrison sent communication to the only corps which was able to give them any succor, that of karaiskaki, requesting it to attack the rear ofthe enemy on csr- tain day, and to annouce it's arrival by a general discharge of musketry, at which moment the garrison would make a sortie, and endeavor to cut their way through the besieging army. On the appointed day the population of Missolonghi was assem- bled. There remained three thousand soldiers, (including those, who, although sick or wounded, were capable of march ing with the assistance of their comrades) a thousand arifcers or other men unused to fighting, and above five thousand wo- men and children. The Grecian women who fancied themselves strong enough to brave the danger and fatigue of the sortie, dressed themselves in mems clothes, in or der that ifthey were unable to escape the enemy, they might be mIstahe, for soldiers aud put to death instantly. Many ofthem hung round their necks and round the necks of their children, as protecting ta- lisman, the revered relics of their ances- tors, and wore concealed daggers, with which either to strike the enemy, or to se- cure their not being taken alive. Those whose weakness forbade them to follow the troops, joined the desperately wounded, the sick, the aged, and the infants, and re- solved to bury themselves in the ruins of the town. It was terrible moment. AL most all the families of Missolonghi were divided into two parts those who remain ed in expectation of death, and those who were on the point of rushing forth to ven- geance and to new dangers. The hardest warriors were subdued to tears and the bravest hearts quailed at the approaching separation. All these preparations were, however, rendered abortive by the infa- nous treachery ofa Bulgarian soldier, who had deserted to Ibrahim, and disclosed the whole plan. The Turks suddenly attack ed the town and bathed themselves in Christian blood.\n\n The scene that followed was hideous \"But one voice was heard among tt1e- des- vonoep g aavs M Eahro. To the",

It is as well known, that the French, like ourselves, ,have their Greek\n\n Committees, who detest the Pacha, and\n\n raise subscriptions to drive his forces from\n\n Europe. Among the former is General\n\n Count Livron, who enjoys the confidence\n\n of the Egyptian Chief; and among the\n\n latter is M.de Trone,a a respectable mem-\n\n Der of the Paris bar-an ardent lover of\n\n freedom and Greece. Count Livron, a\n\n few months ago, arrived at Marseilles to\n\n recruit for the Pacha, when M. de Trone,\n\n hearing of his arrival and the object of his\n\n visit, sent him message to the following\n\n purport: that he (de Trone) was anxious to do something for the freedom of Greece that his delicate health and domestic av- ocations would not permit him to 90 and fight its enemies on the Greek soil-and that he was therefore obliged to select one ot them nearer home, who disgraced the name of Frenchman, by joining it with that of a renegade. M. de Trone conclu- ded by asking the Count to tell him when 1t would be convenient for him that he should come to Marseilles to meet him. Livron answered that M. de Trone need not give himself the trouble of travelling to Marseilles, as he (Liyron) was about to set out for Paris, where he would let him hear from him immediately OH his arrival. The Count did indeed soon arrive, and mentioned the extraordinary challenge to some of his friends, who wishing to play upon his feelings or to try his firmness, represented de Trone as formidable an- tagonist, who had already in duels sealed the fate of several of his adversaries. Li- vron, as being the challenged party ,had the choice of weapons, and wishing to place himself on something like an equality with so noted parsonage, proposed that they should fight with swords on horse- back.\n\n De Trone, though he had never fought in his lifetime with any kind of weapons ,on horseback or on foot, was obliged to ac- cept of this tournament with cavalry off, cer. They accordingly went .out to St. Ouens, village in the neighborhood of Paris, with their respective seconds. We shall not stop to describe how these cham pions of the Greeks and Egyptians were accoutred-how they prepared for the combat,and what hopes and fears animated the bosom of each. Suffice it to say that the righteous cause prevailed-that the cavalry officer was unhorsed by the lawyer ---and that the count arma togG was ex- empli6ed in favor of Greece.\n\n ",

Since his confinement here he has been ao'ltulty dumb for three years Fomteem d0ys he abstained from all nouriShment, and being visited on the 14th day of his fasting, he was found so weak and emacia- ted as to be unable to raise himself in bed, and on being asked if he would take some food, he replied, \"brmg me pint of rum /\" On this day, however, he took nourishment and soon regained his former strength. Whether he was sick during that time is unknown, as he made no com plaint to that effect, but he undoubtedly intended to terminate his existence by starvation, being under the influence of his most malignant temper. Since that time he frequently abstaihed from food during three, four and five days at a time Tobacco is almost his only solace, and when he cannot obtain this, he substitutes for it straw taken from his bed. He never willingly changes or slaves himself, conse- quently the jail-keeper, semi-annuaIly, strips, washes and slaves him by force, and places on him clean clothing.

Athens holds out and will hold out !; the rainy season has com menced, and must every day make the situation of the enemy worse. The gar- rison well supplied with all necessaries, and we are under no apprehension for the place. Culuckis Pasllaw met with sev- were loss, the other day, in an affair with karraskikas. This commander, as I in- formed you, had changed his plan to that of openly attacking the enemy upon the plain of Athens, to that of cutting off his supplies from distancc--He had taken a post for this purpose, when body of 1900 Turks, sent out by Cutuckis. had advanced almost to Salona. He fol- lowed them up, attacked them in defile, killed 800, and forced the remainder to shut themselves up in Venetian chateau, almost without provisions sand he now holds them in blockade.\n\n Tbrahim Pasha remains, with his rem nant of an army, at Trippolizza, entirely inactive and probably very weak though learn with sorrow, that 20 transport ves- sels, laden with provisions and supplies, have arrived safely at Navarin.

Euboea has failed: hoping to find the Turks off their guard, he landed and attacked them. But it appears he was perfectly prepared for and expected;-they fought, the Turks beat them back and drove them on board their ships.
