The perfect harmony which prevailed in the Church aud Society in voting this invitation, and in offering support of $IOOO per annun, induces hope that Mir. c. will accept the call, and soon be settled among\n\n The Students of the Law Office, in this village, eel ebrated the fy-frst anniversary of American Inde- pendence, by appropriate exercises in St. Michaels Church, and public dinner. The address by Mir. Parker heard with interest and pleasure by all in the house. His few remarks inrelaon to present na- tional poltcswere such might have been expected from liberal and enlightened mind He made no aIuson to either of the candidates for the next Pres dency, personality but simply spoke of the principle So much agtated at the present day relative to state rights, and the Pretended encroachment upon these rights by the General Government; and showed most conclusiveIy that as nation, we have more to fear from the independent sovereignty of the individual states, than we have fromany liability encreachment\n\n  ernment. This question is afavorite hobby with the opposition, who continually clamouring for the independence of the separate states and pretending lest this independence should be destroyed by the present administration. We care however, much inclined believe in the vulgar proverb that if the states are all claim the independence that Geor gia has recently claimed, there is much more danger that the \"pigs will eat the sow, than there is that the SOW will eat up the pigs\"\n\n After the close of the services at the Church, pro- cession was formed by the Students, accompanied by several respectable gentlemen of the village, which moved to the County House, where dinner was ser- we'd up; after partaking of which the following toasts were drank:-\n\n 1.

Many able addresses were made to the meet ing in support of sundry resolutions approving the pursued by the great and patriotic state of Pennsylvania, in calling convention at this time, in order to take firm and enlightened stand in favor of the American System. Mr. Mallary, the able chairman of the Committee Manufactures, in the last Con- gress, addressed the meeting, and urged the import ance of the appointment of delegates to the Penn. meeting, for the purpose of refutng in the clearest manner the oft repeated assertion upon the floor of Congress, that the American farmer has no interest in the protection of manufactures, and is totally inder- ent to the success of the Woollens Bl-the measure having originated entirely in the avarice of rich cap- taists. Theremarks of Mir. M. in support of the ap- Pointment ofdelegates from Vt. will apply with equal force to Connecticut But we presume few if any of agricultural readers require argumentsto to convince them of the importance of protecting and encouraging domestic industry. At the above meeting the follow ing gentlemen were appointed delegates to the Harris hurgh Convention: Wm. Jarvis Esq. Hon. R. c. Malary, Hon. Elijah Paine, Wm. Hall, Esq. and Hon. Heman Allen.\n\n c,,,n-,o,or ~.or W",

The violent hostility of the leaders of the opposition to Domestic industry protected by the Wooen B--the defeat of the hundred and SSrty thOusGd dOlLGrS interest saving bilthe violent and indscrminate opposition to the Administration, right wrong, and the bitter personal denunciaon of the i members of the Government who have grown old in the faithful performances of public servce are, bihed producing strong reaetlon and the People are railyng with firm and cheerful spirit in defence of the Government of their country.--- VttGge Record. The Duke of Wellington acknowledged in the House of Lords that it would be ridiculous in him to think himself qualified to act Prime Minister of England, thongh he thought himself qualified to com mand her armies. Modesty seems to have deserted republics, and taken refuge in courts Such senti- l T.aI him mmorta--but he seems better disposed to act on 1 the maxim, \"to keep what he gets and get what he can''-[ Rich. Whg.1\n\n The following paragraph is copied from the Mon 1 treal Courant of Wednesday last;\n\n \"The Hon. Col. J. Ramsay, brother of His Excel lency the Governor in Chief has lately arrived with despatches to His Excellency from England. We un- derstand that immediately upon his reaching the Gov ernor messenger was sent to summon the attendance of the Socito~ General, and the whole party to 1 proceed forthwith to Quebec, to examine the de- spatches. It Is rumored, but we give it only that the despaches contain instructions of HiSEx. to take away the constitution hitherto enjoyed by the country and to place 1t under the control of the Gov ernor and Council; which measure, 1t is said, was occasioned by the difficulties which constantly distract the Provincial Parliament. It is not very probable that this report correct for the constitution was ] granted to this country by act of Parliament we presume it could onysbe taken away by one, unless 1 there was provision in the act by which 1t was | try it might be taken away. Certain it is that the | despatches contain something of importance to the country, and probably will put rest to the exist ing difficulties, which we should not regret. It is certain that strong military force is coming out to this country, for what purpose we cannot dvine.\" Military naoremepts.--The embarkation of British troops for Canada, the enrolment and discipline of the provincial militia, and the extensive fortifcations now going forward wears an appearance of hostile preparations, according better with times that have l passed than the amcable relations which now ex- ist between England and America. We regard the existing commercial differences as mere questions of policy about which each nation has mutual right to pursue its own interest, without of com plaint The Canadas, from their situation, are se- cure from all enemies but the United States. The defence and ornaments, therefore, for these prov inces must be designed to Keep this country in o- beyanee. The troops on their way to Canada with the forces already there, outnumber the whole reg uar army of the United States. But these things are only entitled to passing remark. We are all ways prepared for the contingencies incident to all governments. No nation is more desrous of cultiva ting the arts of peace, more capable of sustaining the shocks of war.---ROchester paper.\n\n Disastrous effects ef the iate Gale on the Lakes- The gale the destructive effects of which at Buffalo and on Lake Erie have been already described. Mon-\n\n real Courant of the 27th u speaks of it as one of the most disastrous gales which have visited the upper rivers within its recollection. The loss in lives and property is truly lamentable gives the following particulars :---\n\n The accounts of disasters on lake St. Peters are very distressing, and 1t is impossible say what ex- tent of damage has been done Fourteen rafts it is believed have been shattered and by some accounts the number of lives lost is estimated be nearly an hundred. We have spoken (says the Courant) with\n\n person who was one of those saved from a raft that was wrecked opposite to Pointe du Lac, on which there were B hands altogether, II of whom were drowned he described the suerings of the survivors as painful in the extreme. Eleven persons were res cued by the jollyboat of the Waterloo but the crow of the boat were unable to gain the Waterloo after they had taken up the sufferers, and it was feared they were lost; but happily when the Waterloo next morning stopped at Three Rivers they found that the jollyboat had reached that place, and that all was safe. The Waterloo we understand, sustained some inury in nearing the sufferers, by floating pieces of rafts 1; she also, when Quebec, struck on rock, by which she was damaged in the bottom but not so as to prevent her running for any length of time. Bateaux loaded with flower. &c. were also wrecked during the gale; and have been told that on the following morning the lake literally cov- cred with pieces of ras -four barrels wreck of bat teaux c. and presented vast of desolaton. In the course of the night of the wrecks passed Three Rivers, upon which several persons were cling ing, crying for assistance in the most appalling man. ner but from the extreme darknes of the night and the violence with which the tempest ragged it would have been impossible for the inhabitance of Three Rivers to render them any assistance-the attempt would have been attended with almost certain destruc- ton. The steamboat Lauzon, which plies between Point Levi and Quebec, in attempting to cross on Saturday morning with number of passengers, was carried by the violence of the gale below the falls of MOntmorenci---she reached Ouehec late in tho eva.",

Many able addresses were made to the meet ing in support of sundry resolutions approving the pursued by the great and patriotic state of Pennsylvania, in calling convention at this time, in order to take firm and enlightened stand in favor of the American System. Mr. Mallary, the able chairman of the Committee Manufactures, in the last Con- gress, addressed the meeting, and urged the import ance of the appointment of delegates to the Penn. meeting, for the purpose of refutng in the clearest manner the oft repeated assertion upon the floor of Congress, that the American farmer has no interest in the protection of manufactures, and is totally inder- ent to the success of the Woollens Bl-the measure having originated entirely in the avarice of rich cap- taists. Theremarks of Mir. M. in support of the ap- Pointment ofdelegates from Vt. will apply with equal force to Connecticut But we presume few if any of agricultural readers require argumentsto to convince them of the importance of protecting and encouraging domestic industry.

It is certain that strong military force is coming out to this country, for what purpose we cannot dvine.\" Military naoremepts.--The embarkation of British troops for Canada, the enrolment and discipline of the provincial militia, and the extensive fortifcations now going forward wears an appearance of hostile preparations, according better with times that have l passed than the amcable relations which now ex- ist between England and America. We regard the existing commercial differences as mere questions of policy about which each nation has mutual right to pursue its own interest, without of com plaint The Canadas, from their situation, are se- cure from all enemies but the United States. The defence and ornaments, therefore, for these prov inces must be designed to Keep this country in o- beyanee. The troops on their way to Canada with the forces already there, outnumber the whole reg uar army of the United States. But these things are only entitled to passing remark. We are all ways prepared for the contingencies incident to all governments. No nation is more desrous of cultiva ting the arts of peace, more capable of sustaining the shocks of war.---ROchester paper.\n\n Disastrous effects ef the iate Gale on the Lakes- The gale the destructive effects of which at Buffalo and on Lake Erie have been already described. Mon-\n\n real Courant of the 27th u speaks of it as one of the most disastrous gales which have visited the upper rivers within its recollection. The loss in lives and property is truly lamentable gives the following particulars :---\n\n The accounts of disasters on lake St. Peters are very distressing, and 1t is impossible say what ex- tent of damage has been done Fourteen rafts it is believed have been shattered and by some accounts the number of lives lost is estimated be nearly an hundred. We have spoken (says the Courant) with\n\n person who was one of those saved from a raft that was wrecked opposite to Pointe du Lac, on which there were B hands altogether, II of whom were drowned he described the suerings of the survivors as painful in the extreme. Eleven persons were res cued by the jollyboat of the Waterloo but the crow of the boat were unable to gain the Waterloo after they had taken up the sufferers, and it was feared they were lost; but happily when the Waterloo next morning stopped at Three Rivers they found that the jollyboat had reached that place, and that all was safe. The Waterloo we understand, sustained some inury in nearing the sufferers, by floating pieces of rafts 1; she also, when Quebec, struck on rock, by which she was damaged in the bottom but not so as to prevent her running for any length of time. Bateaux loaded with flower. &c. were also wrecked during the gale; and have been told that on the following morning the lake literally cov- cred with pieces of ras -four barrels wreck of bat teaux c. and presented vast of desolaton. In the course of the night of the wrecks passed Three Rivers, upon which several persons were cling ing, crying for assistance in the most appalling man. ner but from the extreme darknes of the night and the violence with which the tempest ragged it would have been impossible for the inhabitance of Three Rivers to render them any assistance-the attempt would have been attended with almost certain destruc- ton. The steamboat Lauzon, which plies between Point Levi and Quebec, in attempting to cross on Saturday morning with number of passengers, was carried by the violence of the gale below the falls of MOntmorenci---she reached Ouehec late in tho eva.",
