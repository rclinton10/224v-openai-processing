But in the pursuit of both these sures, we have done that which we have ever meant to do; never gave even an intimation that we meant to act contrary to the we have pur- sucd\n\n In the commencement of a volume of our pa- per, we can see no reason why we should apologize for any supposed alterations in general political course the past year, give any pledges to the course we shall pursue the coming year. We shall oppose the elevation of Gen. Jackson and his harpagons to the highest offices in the country- and so far the course of Mir. Adams and his cabi net is marked by attachment to domestic rather than foreign interests, so long shall yield them hearty support. We shall oppose legislative Caucusses, and every other similar which has tendency to destroy free and unbiased eec- ton; and so long present state constitution and the rights which it guarantees the people, respected by our state administration, so long will it command confidence, and receive from us cheerful and liberal support.\n\n Manutacturers' Meeting in Boston-A large & high ly respectable meeting of gentlemen friendly to the encouragement of domestic manufactures held in Boston the fifth inst. Many able addresses were made to the meeting, supporting the object for which they assembled & calculating in clear & forci bic manner the importance of strictly adhering to, and warmly supporting, the \"American System' of pro- tecting industry, in preference to that of other country. We have given the speech of Mir. Otis entire; not because we consider it better than many others that delivered; but because Mir. Otis IS gentleman of age, of wealth, of experience, and has spent his life thus far in the midst of great commercial people; and consider opinions advan- ced by such entitled to great degree of credit The people of the Ncw-Engand Middle and Western States, have very deep interest in the question now pending, whether Congress shall establish such sys shall give safety and stability to American indus try, whether shall be left entirely to the mercy of older manufacturing and commercial nations, who strenuously persist in te adoption of such exclusively protect the industry and capital of their own people-whether shall be driven to the cessy of sending gold to England to purchase wool len goods,-a country which refuses to receive any important article of American growth industry, with the exception of Cotton-or whether such protec- ton shall be given to manufacturers shall ble them to supply our market with the article.\n\n This question is to be decided in the Senate at the next session of Congress- Whether the bill which passed the House in May last will pass the Senate is extremely doubtful. The measure is now, and has been, tavourite one with MT. Adams and Mir. Clay, and entirely devoid of principle the efforts made by the \"Jackson Combination\" that no means will be left untried to defeat the bi The people however will be heard upon this subject; and already has spirit of enquiry gone abroad among the rcemen of certain states deeply interested in the manufactu ring question: who were recently opposed to Mr. Ad- ams that augers we'll not only for the American Sys tem\" but also for the reelection of present Chief Magistrate.\n\n The editor of the Hartford Times, paper of con- siderable circulation, and possessing good share of political influence abours almost necessarily to i'm press upon the public mind the opinion that Mr. Ad is unworthy of rust in the great republican family, and that Gen. Jackson, his competitor, possesses al- most infinitely more worth and patriotism than he does; and predicts that the time will shortly come when this will be owned and acknowledged by the republicans of Connecticut. Possibly should we make counter statement to this we should find many who would consider us worthy of credit, Mir. Wells finds to support his theory But the opinions of great men will ever be taken in preference either his ours, we shall give below certain extracts from late New York American relative to the comparative merits of Messrs.

Inthe Times of the 11th the above is called \"cvil request for missing number of the Pos,\" and the editor accuses of every thing vile, for noticing his \"reques in the manner we did, In the Times of the 18th Mir.

We considered it impossible that the editor of the Times alone should miss hspaper, when all rsheets sent to Hartford covered in the same envelope; and we also considered it almost impossible that the whole package should be lost. Such however ap- pears to have been the fact; and had the editor reality cvilly requested' the number in question, 1t would have been forwarded and no {\" ink shed' upon the subject.\n\n We again very civilly'' request Mir.

The common sense of the people is neither pleased nor eded by such indefinite attacks upon the character, political moral, of each other as individuals.

As the fold is octave, the volumes are not nearly 50 large the quarto editions; but the paper is finer and winter; the execution handsomer the print to appearance nearly as large; and it be turned to the light with much less nconyenence, 1t may perhaps be read with equal and pleasure. It has the advantage of be ing cheaper, less cumbersome, and more elegant.\n\n \"ARMSTRONG'S EDITION, therefore, is the one which, most highly recommend for the use of families. It is peculiarly calculated to supcrsede the of large Bible; and in two respects it will answer better purpose merely for reading the scrip lures, it is less cumbersome, and may be read by several persons at the same tme.\", @-ALSO- aSts Just received, and for Sale as above, A TREATISE ON SURVEYING. 1sp .not,r GSdMnaRrf, Fourth Improved Edition.-ALso, ES t...
