It came too late to appear in our last Missionary Her aid. And though we usually deem it lm- proper to anticipate that official organ oi the Board, in the publication ot mlssIona- ry intelligence which may be in our power; vet we feel it would now he wrong to with hold that. which would cause many thanks givings to God, and convey to the friends of missions so signal an evidence of the f- nal triumphs of the truth. We shall barely state few leading facts, necessari- ly onliting many interesting particulars. In presenting this brief notice of what God has wrought, we shall not satisfy the reader but only excite a stronger desire to see the details in the April Herald. The intelligence given is all from the I'Gt- est;ne Mission. The ordinary concerns of the missions, and further particulars of the hopeful converts of whom we have before heard, would have been unusually anima- ting. But were permitted to hear of other events, of character quite unexpected, which have come to pass, in the East in these days.\n\n The intelligence to which we allude, is contained in letter from MT. Goodell, at Beyroot, dated Sept. 29th and Oct. 5th, 1926. It appears that MT. King, when he set out on his return to this country, left FarsWeN Letter to the people of Syria. This contained testimony to the great truths of the gospel. A translation of this letter was sent to Constantinople, with CO., pious marginal references to scripture proofs prepared by MT. Goodell. This letter excited great commotiQn among the Armenians, 100000 of whom resided in that city and neighborhood. A general meeting of the monks, priests and patri- archs of that church was held; attended also by the Greek patriarch of Constanti- nople and the Grek patriarch of Jerusa- lem, who happened to be then in the city. MT. Kings letter was read, and discussed at length in that meeting. The long neg lected Bible was produced in the conclave, and the reference consulted. The conse- quence was, a division i'll the assembly, and warm discussion of the practices of their own church. But eventually several resolutions were passed ,which clearly show that strong conviction of the truth had seiz- ed on the minds of major part: and that light has dawned, even upon the ecclesi- astics of the Armenian Church, which must, ere long, subvert the fabric of their su- perstition. The substance of the resolu- tions is, that the patriarch should dismiss the monks and priests from the convent at Jerusalem, & appoint few persons in their places who have been married but are widoweEs that no new monks ol priests be appointed for twenty-five years that no women or boys go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem that men that go should not be permitted to renal there more than four days; and that they no longet witness the pretended miracle of the holy fire\"\n\n We make no cement; aware that facts, in case like this. need but an explicit statement to bring them with power to the pious heart. We would barely remark, that these beloved missionaries could not have anticipated a result like this, in less than seven years from their leaving their native shores, and within three years from the location of the mission in Syria. MT. King too, when writing that favorite letter, did not imagine in what an assembly it would speak, or what couvulsion it would occasion in the superstitions of a corrupt church, Prehaps he has yet to learn what the Lord has done by his feeble instrumen- tality. By the last accounts he was in France and though success speedily fol- lowed his parting effort in the Holy Land, possibly he will first hear of that success on arriving here among his own people. The full extent of the benefit he will learn, only when the light of eternity shall dis close it.\n\n From the New-Yo ork Observer.\n\n Latest and interesting from Beyroot.\n\n Through the kindness of the gentleman to whom it was addressed, we are enabled to lay before our readers the following ve- ry interesting letter from Beyroot, dated Oct. z, 1925; more than two months la ter than the most recent intelligence be- fore received from the mission.

We have seen ridicule, and scorn, and persecution, and the most vio- | lent opposition and we have seen the om- nipotence of Gods truth, and the cmnip- l otence of his Spirit, in carrying forward the great work of benevolence in spite ot the machinations of the powers of darkness. We have seen this wretched government convulsed in every part, the picture of horror, and carrying consternation through all ranks of society in Turkey and we have seen the re-eStablishment of branch of that kingdom of peace and righteousness, which is to ''break in pieces and destroy all other kingdoms\" and which IS to en- dure forever. We have seen violence and oppression almost beyond the endurance of human nature: men ''gnawing their tongues for pain,\" and threatening to put a period to an existence so embitterred as to be deemed no longer blessing, but ''re- pented not Of their eUi deeds ;\" and we have seen few melted, not by the judg- ments, but by the mercieS of heaven; not subdhed by the wrongs and cruelties they suffer, nor driven by the terrors of the world to come,' but sweetly drawn by the cords of everlasting love, and in the day Of Gods saving power made the willing sub jects of his kingdom.\n\n Scarcely has day passed for long time, in which our bosoms have not been agitated by witnessing scenes or hearing reports, encouraging or discouraging to us, inspiring nOw hope, now fear. We are a. larmed, ,Ov by Greek cruisers before the town, and noU by the appearance of Mo- hammed Ais fleet. At One time, we are told that Firmans have been purchased from the Grand Signior to siege upon those Armenians connected with us, who have embraced the Protestent faith and ct C. nother, that our beloved brother Asaad Shidiak, who has long been suffering for the sake of Christ, is almost worn out, or >is already dead, from the severity of the treatment which he receives from the Patri- arch. I'O-day,we are troubled at the cus- tom house in getting passed any thing that is printed in Arabic; and are compelled to hear the angry voices, ,and to witness the distorted countenances of those, (not Mus sulmans but christians, )who exclaim, m,\"That these books had ought to be thrown into the sea;\" to-morrow, we are imposed upon by the cupidity of some of the Emres, and are thwarted in our plans by the hostility of others. At another moment, we have before us Ill the horrors of famine, and are prohibited by the Pasha from importing\n\n any thing from abroad, except by paying\n\n such enormous duties, as that it shall be no detriment to his own monopoly and ct C.\n\n mother, we receive official notice of the\n\n fear of rupture between England and\n\n Porte, and are warned to provide for our\n\n personal safety. We hear of wars and ru-\n\n mors of wars, of pestilence and famine, of\n\n carnage and blood.\n\n And in the midst of all these, and many,\n\n many more such like things, it is on the\n\n other hand reported to us for our comfort, -at one time, that there is prospect of\n\n the deliverence of Asaad Shidak from\n\n prison and from death !; ct another, that\n\n different individuals scattered here and there, have, by the simple reading of the word of God, become convinced of the errors of their church, some of whom bold- ly and warmly espoused the cause of truth: nOa0, that light is surely breaking forth up- on many of these dark villages, aud that important moral changes are alraady taking place; and nop, that the whole Armenian church has publicly reformed of some of her abuses, and that she appears fast pre- pairing to undergo complete moral revo- of which intelligence, bad and good, is perhaps contradicted the sec ond day, modified the third, or confirmed the fourth. In the mean time, one of our schoolmasters is writing to us, that the prejudicies against female education are breaking away, and that he has ,ftteen girls in his school; another, that he has forty-t,0o in his while the superintend- ent reports, that in all our schools, there are ninty girls, and nearly four Hundred boys. .'We thank God, and take courage\" We sit down in our families, and ten or twelve natives sit down with us, every evening, to read the holy Scriptures, and listen to our expositions aud exhortations One tells us of the darkness, stubbornness, and anguish of his-soul, and requests our prayers.

            "article": "The last Monthly Concert was one of the most interesting ever held m Boston, The intelligence communicated was alto eether the most important, especially when considered in its bearings up the future nrossect of Missions, of any ever receIVed bv the Board at one time. It came too late to appear in our last Missionary Her aid. And though we usually deem it lm- proper to anticipate that official organ oi the Board, in the publication ot mlssIona- ry intelligence which may be in our power; vet we feel it would now he wrong to with hold that. which would cause many thanks givings to God, and convey to the friends of missions so signal an evidence of the f- nal triumphs of the truth. We shall barely state few leading facts, necessari- ly onliting many interesting particulars. In presenting this brief notice of what God has wrought, we shall not satisfy the reader but only excite a stronger desire to see the details in the April Herald. The intelligence given is all from the I'Gt- est;ne Mission. The ordinary concerns of the missions, and further particulars of the hopeful converts of whom we have before heard, would have been unusually anima- ting. But were permitted to hear of other events, of character quite unexpected, which have come to pass, in the East in these days.\n\n The intelligence to which we allude, is contained in letter from MT. Goodell, at Beyroot, dated Sept. 29th and Oct. 5th, 1926. It appears that MT. King, when he set out on his return to this country, left FarsWeN Letter to the people of Syria. This contained testimony to the great truths of the gospel. A translation of this letter was sent to Constantinople, with CO., pious marginal references to scripture proofs prepared by MT. Goodell. This letter excited great commotiQn among the Armenians, 100000 of whom resided in that city and neighborhood. A general meeting of the monks, priests and patri- archs of that church was held; attended also by the Greek patriarch of Constanti- nople and the Grek patriarch of Jerusa- lem, who happened to be then in the city. MT. Kings letter was read, and discussed at length in that meeting. The long neg lected Bible was produced in the conclave, and the reference consulted. The conse- quence was, a division i'll the assembly, and warm discussion of the practices of their own church. But eventually several resolutions were passed ,which clearly show that strong conviction of the truth had seiz- ed on the minds of major part: and that light has dawned, even upon the ecclesi- astics of the Armenian Church, which must, ere long, subvert the fabric of their su- perstition. The substance of the resolu- tions is, that the patriarch should dismiss the monks and priests from the convent at Jerusalem, & appoint few persons in their places who have been married but are widoweEs that no new monks ol priests be appointed for twenty-five years that no women or boys go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem that men that go should not be permitted to renal there more than four days; and that they no longet witness the pretended miracle of the holy fire\"\n\n We make no cement; aware that facts, in case like this. need but an explicit statement to bring them with power to the pious heart. We would barely remark, that these beloved missionaries could not have anticipated a result like this, in less than seven years from their leaving their native shores, and within three years from the location of the mission in Syria. MT. King too, when writing that favorite letter, did not imagine in what an assembly it would speak, or what couvulsion it would occasion in the superstitions of a corrupt church, Prehaps he has yet to learn what the Lord has done by his feeble instrumen- tality. By the last accounts he was in France and though success speedily fol- lowed his parting effort in the Holy Land, possibly he will first hear of that success on arriving here among his own people. The full extent of the benefit he will learn, only when the light of eternity shall dis close it.\n\n From the New-Yo ork Observer.\n\n Latest and interesting from Beyroot.\n\n Through the kindness of the gentleman to whom it was addressed, we are enabled to lay before our readers the following ve- ry interesting letter from Beyroot, dated Oct. z, 1925; more than two months la ter than the most recent intelligence be- fore received from the mission. It will be seen that Asaad Shidiak, whose Declare ton may be found on our first page, was still alive as was supposed, but in prison, where he had been confined and i'll treated",

            "article": "\n\n of more than a thousand years and we have seen little cloud rising, and gently and sweetly shedding down refreshing showers. We have seen ridicule, and scorn, and persecution, and the most vio- | lent opposition and we have seen the om- nipotence of Gods truth, and the cmnip- l otence of his Spirit, in carrying forward the great work of benevolence in spite ot the machinations of the powers of darkness. We have seen this wretched government convulsed in every part, the picture of horror, and carrying consternation through all ranks of society in Turkey and we have seen the re-eStablishment of branch of that kingdom of peace and righteousness, which is to ''break in pieces and destroy all other kingdoms\" and which IS to en- dure forever. We have seen violence and oppression almost beyond the endurance of human nature: men ''gnawing their tongues for pain,\" and threatening to put a period to an existence so embitterred as to be deemed no longer blessing, but ''re- pented not Of their eUi deeds ;\" and we have seen few melted, not by the judg- ments, but by the mercieS of heaven; not subdhed by the wrongs and cruelties they suffer, nor driven by the terrors of the world to come,' but sweetly drawn by the cords of everlasting love, and in the day Of Gods saving power made the willing sub jects of his kingdom.\n\n Scarcely has day passed for long time, in which our bosoms have not been agitated by witnessing scenes or hearing reports, encouraging or discouraging to us, inspiring nOw hope, now fear. We are a. larmed, ,Ov by Greek cruisers before the town, and noU by the appearance of Mo- hammed Ais fleet. At One time, we are told that Firmans have been purchased from the Grand Signior to siege upon those Armenians connected with us, who have embraced the Protestent faith and ct C. nother, that our beloved brother Asaad Shidiak, who has long been suffering for the sake of Christ, is almost worn out, or >is already dead, from the severity of the treatment which he receives from the Patri- arch. I'O-day,we are troubled at the cus- tom house in getting passed any thing that is printed in Arabic; and are compelled to hear the angry voices, ,and to witness the distorted countenances of those, (not Mus sulmans but christians, )who exclaim, m,\"That these books had ought to be thrown into the sea;\" to-morrow, we are imposed upon by the cupidity of some of the Emres, and are thwarted in our plans by the hostility of others. At another moment, we have before us Ill the horrors of famine, and are prohibited by the Pasha from importing\n\n any thing from abroad, except by paying\n\n such enormous duties, as that it shall be no detriment to his own monopoly and ct C.\n\n mother, we receive official notice of the\n\n fear of rupture between England and\n\n Porte, and are warned to provide for our\n\n personal safety. We hear of wars and ru-\n\n mors of wars, of pestilence and famine, of\n\n carnage and blood.\n\n And in the midst of all these, and many,\n\n many more such like things, it is on the\n\n other hand reported to us for our comfort, -at one time, that there is prospect of\n\n the deliverence of Asaad Shidak from\n\n prison and from death !; ct another, that\n\n different individuals scattered here and there, have, by the simple reading of the word of God, become convinced of the errors of their church, some of whom bold- ly and warmly espoused the cause of truth: nOa0, that light is surely breaking forth up- on many of these dark villages, aud that important moral changes are alraady taking place; and nop, that the whole Armenian church has publicly reformed of some of her abuses, and that she appears fast pre- pairing to undergo complete moral revo- of which intelligence, bad and good, is perhaps contradicted the sec ond day, modified the third, or confirmed the fourth. In the mean time, one of our schoolmasters is writing to us, that the prejudicies against female education are breaking away, and that he has ,ftteen girls in his school; another, that he has forty-t,0o in his while the superintend- ent reports, that in all our schools, there are ninty girls, and nearly four Hundred boys. .'We thank God, and take courage\" We sit down in our families, and ten or twelve natives sit down with us, every evening, to read the holy Scriptures, and listen to our expositions aud exhortations One tells us of the darkness, stubbornness, and anguish of his-soul, and requests our prayers.

M ELLEN, Sir-tne cause OL humanity demands of me to give the following state ment: My wife had for six years been in decline aud pronounced by her Physicians to be in a consumptive state, and was attended by severe pain in her side, with Cough & difficulty of breathing, She was reduced so low as to be unable to get from her bed to the fire without aid. All hopes of her recovery had long been given up. In this situation, ,gas prevailed upon, as a last possible resort, vet without any hopes of success, to make use of :\" Anderson's Cough Drops.\" She com menced the use of them in February last and after using two bottles, to the astonishinent of all, in the month of May following the health of my wife was entirely restored, and since which, her health and strength were perhaps never better. Feeling a deep interest that the public in general may resort to the same remedy, when their friends and relatives are apparently. or evidently on the brink of the grave, to rescue them from from the same. You are at liberty to publish the above.\n\n am respectfully, sc. #..\n\n JAMES H. STYLES. RhineJecI:, Dutchess co. fN. Y.)

Nathan Huntington, living in the same place was afflicted with very bad cough for num- ber of years, and that in 823 she was redu- ced so low that it was thought she must soon be in her grave, as she was scarcely able to walk from her bed to the fire, when she com menced taking Andersen's Cough Drops, the use of which, in short time so far restored her, that she was soon able to do good days work. l can cheerfully recommend this med icine to the public.\n\n PHILO HUDSON, Pastor .. of the Church in Ashford, (Conn.)
