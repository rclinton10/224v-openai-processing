H.N.\n\n A MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERY.\n\n MIR. EDITOR, will you have the goodness to publish the following, in your paper, for the benefit ofall those whom it may con- cern.\n\n A few days ago. being belated in the after noon about doing an errand at a few miles distance, resolved to attend to it early in the morning. Iawoke and hastened from my bed,and immediately heard the clock strike. l counted four. Sure thought l., here is some mistake. It was broad day,and but 4 o'clock. could not account for t. But I sadded my horse and trotted off. It was actually as light as the evening IS after sunset. The air was cool and refreshing, and enlivening. It seemed matter of enchant- ment. I did my business. My coltish old Dobbin seemed to enter into the life of the jaunt, and arrived at my breakfast, full of health an humour. The first time saw my minister, who by the way, is a college learned man, asked him what could be the meaning of this uncommon light morning. He smiled and told me it was the ordinary course ot things; that it was just as light four hours at- ter midnight, as it was four hours before mid night. This was matter for sober consider ton. I resolved to see and prove for my self. Irose every morning punctualIy at 4, went into my field, looked about me, and found it light enough to work. The thought struck me that couple of houro' 1abour oe- fore breakfast would amount to great deal. For work never felt better. have follow ed if m ever since my fields never looked better. Never had SO fine health and spir- it's and my very conscience seems improved. Nv wife enters with her whole heart into this family revolution. My boys are ambi- tious who shall in the morning he the one to give the first call to the others, they skip to the field; and though we cannot Jty with the birds that play about, they are as lively and musical. My three girls too, though they are always afectionate and dutitul, used to be rather pale and languid; but since their early hours, their eyes arc as lovely as the dews off the morning, and their eheeks brighter than the blossoms ofthe field. Our breakfast table is adorned with clean dishes. and sweet milk, butter and cream: and the cheerful welcome which we give each other is sweeter than all the rest. The cows them selves, which go pasture an hour and a half earlier than they used to go, seem to enter iuto the family improvement, and enjoy this hour and half more than halfthe rest of the day and my wife even insists that they actu- ally give more milk than formerly but for this only have her word, and she sticks to it. One thing more I did not mean to men ton, as it is family affair but as 1t IS the best of all, will hint it for the benefit of oth- CT girls. My Sarah, the oldest daughter, was eighteen six years ago; and though, as l said, one of the best hearted Of young per sons, was thin featured, and never seemed to get along as to prospects, as-some others. But these mornings have made her appear halfa dozen years younger and SIX times as handsome; and between ourselves, my neigh bour Days son, one of the msst steady, in dustrious, manly sons which father could wish, has been coming and going, and has to- day asked me a question, which will end in something.\n\n Since my practise of early rising I have made another discovery. fused to see some farms in good order. fences in repair, cattle gentle and sleek, and pastures and fields safe, rich and fourishing others with fences de cayed, cattle poor and wandering. the family, at the sun an hour or two high in the morn ing, half dressed, calling out, 'the cattle in the field shooboy! sheoboy! Whose are they Plague on lem Drive 'em to pound\" The discovery which is, that the former are families that rise at iOuT, LIlc IdtteE InoSo \"HO sleep and snore two hours later.\n\n rNow what have seen & what know, know and if any body don't believe that to sleep from or o'clock to A. IS as long as from II or 12 o'clock to7; that the daylight is just about as early in the morning. as 1t IS late at night, and that the morning is cooler than the day /; then. say, let him try and see and know for himself.

Camberleng an opportunity of showing the reach of his \"genios and app\n\n cation.\" We take the greatest pleasure in laying these interesting particulars before our readers. Mir. MacOn's breakfast consisted of Coffee, corn bread, pone- cake, boiled eggs, bacon, and cheese. MT. V. B., like many O. ther persons, never eats cheese, having a nat ural antipathy to it. MT. Macon, in the true spirit of Southern hospitality, begged MT. V. B. to 'help himself to cheese.' Mr. Van Blu ren declined, but instead of mentioning as a reason,his natural dislike, he told MT. Macon, in most insinuating and winning manner, that he did not eat cheese of late.' And why not ?\" inquired the venerable Macon. \"Why, for this reason,\" said MT. V. B.; and here you should have seen him as we did (for the principal inhabitants ofthe place, ourselves among the number, were peeping in at a window, to witness the interesting spectacle,)\n\n 6 for this rsason said MT. V. B.; most ex- orbitant duty is laid on foreign cheese, in or- der to promote the manufacture of the do- mestic article. Now I hold that making cheese is thing, which the States have re- served to themselves, over which Congress has no control, and I have determined to set my face against this destructive usurpa- tion.\" By not setting your teeth into the domestic article,\" interrupted Mir. Camber- leng, with laugh, in which the company heartily joined. Canberleng, by the way, is the wag of the party.\n\n To this testing remark of MT. Gambler leng, Governor Button, who was prsent, said aside, \"You have your match to set your teeth into this, any how; it is the real white oak\"\n\n Mr. Camberleng caught the last words, and added, you might have said ltUe ouk. Gov ernor,\"-pointing in fact to some indications of vitality. Another general laugh followed this sally.\n\n \"But, joking apart\" said the venerable Macon, when the laughter had little subsid- ed, \"Mr. Van Buren is right. l should like to know, in what part of the Constitution the General Government is vested with the pow CT to protect the manufacture of cheese. Nay, gentlemen, appeal to you, that the word cheese is not to be found in the Constit ution. Mir. Van Buren thank you for vindicating | this reserved right to the individual States. Boy, take the white oak from the table, and never let me see it again till the duty on for eigh cheese is repealed. In a crisis like this, will, at least, have the consolation of being innocent of this grievous oppression of the Southern States\"\n\n \"Call it not grievous oppression of the SoU- thern States alOne.\" said Mr. Camberleng, \" have written letters to the City of New York, on the subject, and let me lay before you the astonishing result result omin- ous to the great navigation and commercial interest of the country. This iniqAtous tax was first imposed in 179O, and was then 4 cents per pound. It has since been raised to nine. For every pound of cheese eaten therefore in the country, the poor oppress- ed consumer pays to the pampered dairy interest nine cents. It is computed, that the inhabitants of the United States eat, one with another, three pounds of cheese, each, per annum. Taking our population at 12\n\n millions, this is Ss millions of pounds. Nine cents a pound on this quantity would give the enormous sum of SS,24O,OOO annually paid to pamper the cheese-making interest of the country. AgaiI, but for this ini- quitous tariff, S6 millions of pounds of cheese would be annually imported, at about ten cents per pound, and principally, through the port of New=York; Here is a capital of 8 1-2 millions of dQllsssx in the single arti- cIe of cheese withdraW& from commerce, ,and all to gratfy an ovefWsening avarice and monopolizing spirit of the-chee manufactu- rers. Such are the burdens laid upon us.\n\n It is therefore peculiarly gratifying that the Patriot States are awake to the common | danger\"\n\n The company were astonished at this dis\n\n play of MT.

It is made of cloth, in the form of cylinder, like bag, 5 feet long and Or , inches in diameter, fitted with strapsto tie it a. round the body. By means of a brass tube with stop, it may be inflated with air from the lungs in minute or two, and is then capable of sustaining from 30 to 45 pounds of iron in water. The cloth is rendered impervious to the water, by a ce- ment of elastic gum. A bag made of the same material has held water 54 hours in our office without being moistened through. The Steam boat Macdonough has been supp piled with fifty of these life preservers, for the security of her passengers, in case of emergency.-D. Ado.\n\n Indian Remoins.-In the course oT last week, some workmen employed in repair- ing the road from Beverly to Manches ester, discovered several skeletons, which are supposed to have belonged to the abprig- ines of our country.\n\n The bodies, (eight in number) lay a. bout two feet below the surface with their heads towards the rising sun. The soil above them had no appearance of having been disturbed black line of mould be- ing perfectly distinct. Under one ofthem was found a square bar of wrought iron one third of an inch in diameter and one foot and half long. At the feet of anoth- CT was pot of earthern ware scolloped round the rim, and ornamented round the border with rnde line work: the body of the pot was plain: the fracture is black, & exhibits spanglcs of mica. The vessel contained quantity of muscles, destined no doubt by these simple theologians for the food ofth\" ':.;\"s spirit Atwas c\"s- tuln with the natives to bury with their friends, corn, shell-6sh, their pipes and other things, which were dearest to them in life. At this day in the western coun- try, the horse and dog repose in the same grave with their master, that the warrior may be ready to ride over the river Styx on the ghost of his horse, with the ghost of his '' faithful dog\" trotting at his heels.\n\n Salem (Mass) Gaz.\n\n UNITED STATES AND GEoRGIA.-We re- gret to learn, from the Savannah Repub- lican, that difference has arisen between the Commissioners of the United States and the State of Georgia, on running the boundary line between the latter and Flo- rida, and that their further progress has been suspended by Governor Troup. Thomas Spalding, Esq. Commissioners on the part of Georgia, has returned to Dari- en, and Thomas Mann Randolph, Esq. Commissioner on the part of the United States, to Milledgeville.\n\n Supplies for the Greeks.-The brig Le- want, Capt. Osgood, has sailed from Phil adelphia for. Napoli di Romania, with an assorted cargo of provisions, of 1850 bar rels for the relief of the suffering Greeks. If the other three vessels that have sailed on the same errand, contained like num- Der, the total is 74OO barrels, besides other provisions and clothing. A fifth vessel is preparing to sail from Boston.\n\n Supposed nsurder.-In Guilford, at 3 o'clock on the morning of the inst. Joel Hotchkiss went to the neighboring house of MT. Jacobs and called up the family, and requested them to come to his house, as he feared his wife was dying. MT. J. and his daughter and son-in-law hurried to the house of H otchkiss. and found Mrs. H. apparently dying, so that she did not speak after they arrived, and expired in few minutes. They asked him what he had been doing.-He denied having struck or injured her in any way-said she got out of bed about 9 o'clock and fell violent ly on the floor, and that about 12 o'clock she got up again and fell partly out at the door, in such manner that he wondered she did not break her neck-that he took her up and placed her in the bed again & went to sleep, and at 3 o'clock awoke and thought his wife was cold and lifeless- that he got up immediately, and told his son nine years of age, to light candle, which he did-and then left his son with her until he ran to Mr..

H.N.\n\n A MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERY.\n\n MIR. EDITOR, will you have the goodness to publish the following, in your paper, for the benefit ofall those whom it may con- cern.\n\n A few days ago. being belated in the after noon about doing an errand at a few miles distance, resolved to attend to it early in the morning. Iawoke and hastened from my bed,and immediately heard the clock strike. l counted four. Sure thought l., here is some mistake. It was broad day,and but 4 o'clock. could not account for t. But I sadded my horse and trotted off. It was actually as light as the evening IS after sunset. The air was cool and refreshing, and enlivening. It seemed matter of enchant- ment. I did my business. My coltish old Dobbin seemed to enter into the life of the jaunt, and arrived at my breakfast, full of health an humour. The first time saw my minister, who by the way, is a college learned man, asked him what could be the meaning of this uncommon light morning. He smiled and told me it was the ordinary course ot things; that it was just as light four hours at- ter midnight, as it was four hours before mid night. This was matter for sober consider ton. I resolved to see and prove for my self. Irose every morning punctualIy at 4, went into my field, looked about me, and found it light enough to work. The thought struck me that couple of houro' 1abour oe- fore breakfast would amount to great deal. For work never felt better. have follow ed if m ever since my fields never looked better. Never had SO fine health and spir- it's and my very conscience seems improved. Nv wife enters with her whole heart into this family revolution. My boys are ambi- tious who shall in the morning he the one to give the first call to the others, they skip to the field; and though we cannot Jty with the birds that play about, they are as lively and musical. My three girls too, though they are always afectionate and dutitul, used to be rather pale and languid; but since their early hours, their eyes arc as lovely as the dews off the morning, and their eheeks brighter than the blossoms ofthe field. Our breakfast table is adorned with clean dishes. and sweet milk, butter and cream: and the cheerful welcome which we give each other is sweeter than all the rest. The cows them selves, which go pasture an hour and a half earlier than they used to go, seem to enter iuto the family improvement, and enjoy this hour and half more than halfthe rest of the day and my wife even insists that they actu- ally give more milk than formerly but for this only have her word, and she sticks to it. One thing more I did not mean to men ton, as it is family affair but as 1t IS the best of all, will hint it for the benefit of oth- CT girls. My Sarah, the oldest daughter, was eighteen six years ago; and though, as l said, one of the best hearted Of young per sons, was thin featured, and never seemed to get along as to prospects, as-some others. But these mornings have made her appear halfa dozen years younger and SIX times as handsome; and between ourselves, my neigh bour Days son, one of the msst steady, in dustrious, manly sons which father could wish, has been coming and going, and has to- day asked me a question, which will end in something.\n\n Since my practise of early rising I have made another discovery. fused to see some farms in good order. fences in repair, cattle gentle and sleek, and pastures and fields safe, rich and fourishing others with fences de cayed, cattle poor and wandering. the family, at the sun an hour or two high in the morn ing, half dressed, calling out, 'the cattle in the field shooboy! sheoboy!

Macons Breakfasts, of the insinuating address of Mir. V. B., which, at the same time, gave MT. Camberleng an opportunity of showing the reach of his \"genios and app\n\n cation.\" We take the greatest pleasure in laying these interesting particulars before our readers. Mir. MacOn's breakfast consisted of Coffee, corn bread, pone- cake, boiled eggs, bacon, and cheese. MT. V. B., like many O. ther persons, never eats cheese, having a nat ural antipathy to it. MT. Macon, in the true spirit of Southern hospitality, begged MT. V. B. to 'help himself to cheese.' Mr. Van Blu ren declined, but instead of mentioning as a reason,his natural dislike, he told MT. Macon, in most insinuating and winning manner, that he did not eat cheese of late.' And why not ?\" inquired the venerable Macon. \"Why, for this reason,\" said MT. V. B.; and here you should have seen him as we did (for the principal inhabitants ofthe place, ourselves among the number, were peeping in at a window, to witness the interesting spectacle,)\n\n 6 for this rsason said MT. V. B.; most ex- orbitant duty is laid on foreign cheese, in or- der to promote the manufacture of the do- mestic article. Now I hold that making cheese is thing, which the States have re- served to themselves, over which Congress has no control, and I have determined to set my face against this destructive usurpa- tion.\" By not setting your teeth into the domestic article,\" interrupted Mir. Camber- leng, with laugh, in which the company heartily joined. Canberleng, by the way, is the wag of the party.\n\n To this testing remark of MT. Gambler leng, Governor Button, who was prsent, said aside, \"You have your match to set your teeth into this, any how; it is the real white oak\"\n\n Mr. Camberleng caught the last words, and added, you might have said ltUe ouk. Gov ernor,\"-pointing in fact to some indications of vitality. Another general laugh followed this sally.\n\n \"But, joking apart\" said the venerable Macon, when the laughter had little subsid- ed, \"Mr. Van Buren is right. l should like to know, in what part of the Constitution the General Government is vested with the pow CT to protect the manufacture of cheese. Nay, gentlemen, appeal to you, that the word cheese is not to be found in the Constit ution. Mir. Van Buren thank you for vindicating | this reserved right to the individual States. Boy, take the white oak from the table, and never let me see it again till the duty on for eigh cheese is repealed. In a crisis like this, will, at least, have the consolation of being innocent of this grievous oppression of the Southern States\"\n\n \"Call it not grievous oppression of the SoU- thern States alOne.\" said Mr. Camberleng, \" have written letters to the City of New York, on the subject, and let me lay before you the astonishing result result omin- ous to the great navigation and commercial interest of the country. This iniqAtous tax was first imposed in 179O, and was then 4 cents per pound. It has since been raised to nine. For every pound of cheese eaten therefore in the country, the poor oppress- ed consumer pays to the pampered dairy interest nine cents. It is computed, that the inhabitants of the United States eat, one with another, three pounds of cheese, each, per annum. Taking our population at 12\n\n millions, this is Ss millions of pounds. Nine cents a pound on this quantity would give the enormous sum of SS,24O,OOO annually paid to pamper the cheese-making interest of the country. AgaiI, but for this ini- quitous tariff, S6 millions of pounds of cheese would be annually imported, at about ten cents per pound, and principally, through the port of New=York; Here is a capital of 8 1-2 millions of dQllsssx in the single arti- cIe of cheese withdraW& from commerce, ,and all to gratfy an ovefWsening avarice and monopolizing spirit of the-chee manufactu- rers. Such are the burdens laid upon us.\n\n It is therefore peculiarly gratifying that the Patriot States are awake to the common | danger\"\n\n The company were astonished at this dis\n\n play of MT.

It is made of cloth, in the form of cylinder, like bag, 5 feet long and Or , inches in diameter, fitted with strapsto tie it a. round the body. By means of a brass tube with stop, it may be inflated with air from the lungs in minute or two, and is then capable of sustaining from 30 to 45 pounds of iron in water. The cloth is rendered impervious to the water, by a ce- ment of elastic gum. A bag made of the same material has held water 54 hours in our office without being moistened through. The Steam boat Macdonough has been supp piled with fifty of these life preservers, for the security of her passengers, in case of emergency.-D.

The soil above them had no appearance of having been disturbed black line of mould be- ing perfectly distinct.
