            "article": "In one Of the letters which we have alluded to\nabove, our readers may recollect the following\npassage:-\n\n\n\"His informer i. e. the Doctor who was the in\nformer oil Mr.. Cook, one Of the investigating COM\nmittee, was Of that place, a\nbrother of -. Of Buffalo. The Doctor\ndoes not think him implicated. but thinks he had\nhis information from M .... His statement\nwas all put in writing in the form Of an affidavit,\nwhich he stands ready to sign al any time it shall\nbe needed. He also informed Us, that he had a\nshort time afterwards relation OF the same facts\nfrom smother mason Of the name of L who\nhad it from Mr.. c of Buffalo, who was\nan actor in the scene Of the night of the 14th-he\nis since dead\"\n\n\n! The person here alluded to as Mr.. c. Of Bufa\nTO-\" was Mr.. Seth Chaplin, of that village, since\ndead. The editor of the Buffalo Journal however,\nstates, positively, that the memory Of this man \" is\nmost grossly slandered, by this imputation. He\nwas not, as will be Proved If necessary out OF this\nvillage at the time mentioned, nor could he be, ow\ning to sickness in his family He is dead, and we\nenvy not the man whose heated Imagination has so\nfar clouded his reason to drive him among the\ntombs, to search for proofs Of what never was.-\nNeither cur liberties morals will be render\ned more safe by yielding the direction of judicial\ntribunals to the hands of men who 80 far forget\nright, as to invade, in a moment of phrenzy, the\n\n\n\n\n\nidle rumor, regardless Of the feelings OF friends, or\nthe reputation of children still in their infancy\"\nThe following note, also, from Col. Chaplin, the\nbrother Of the deceased, is likewise published in\nthe Journal.\n\n\nTO THE PUBLIC.\n\n\nThe feelings Of myself and family been cruelty out\nragged by communication recently published in the Ma\n\n\nonal Observer and repubshed by number of other pa\npers duplicating departed friend Mr. Seth Chaplin,\nbeing concerned in the alleged murder Of William Morgan\nfn f1rntty tn\nthe memory of departed friend to to the\npublic, that the publication referred far it respects\nthe late Seth Chaplin having any knowledge in\nthe affair of William Morgan, an entire fabrication, and\nwholly destitute of the least sembance Of TRUTH and could\noriginated in other feelings than those of the ba\nses and most malignant kind AT the time Of the alleged\ning his domestic concerns, and for number ct days both\npreceding and following that tme confined home by\nthe sickness of his family and not during that time ab\nall from the village of Buffalo Incontestble proof\nOf these facts will shortly be laid before the public; and\nhave only TO observe, further. that proper win\nImmediately be taken ferret the author of this\nwicked and malignant SANDER and those SHALL\ntrust they may be, successful in unmasking the vile\numnisor, he shall not escape that punsnmen, which his\nwickedness and unprovoked magn,y have SO Justly mer\nted. CYRENlUS CHAPLIN.\n\n\nBuffalo, Feb. 10, 1927.\n\n\nHere, then, We have another case of cruel inius\ntice which has been caused by the present excite\nment in regard to this unhappy business. We say\n- another CASE\" because 1t is now certain that\ninnocent man has been convicted, and is now in\nprison for crime in which he had not the least\nparticipa,ion--nay, was not in the county when il\nwas committed. And now it appears that another,\nwho was represented by the investigating commit.\nmttee having been an actor in The bloody deed,\nwas at home, with sick family, eighteen or TWEEN\nty miles distant 1t is time for discreet men TO\npause, therefore, lest others may be cruelty wrong\ned likewise.\n\n\nIn one Of those letters moreover, it was repre-.\nIF he cfA\nTelegraph. who was appointed one Of the Delegates\n10 the Lewiston Convention, did not go in conse-\nuuence OF having been threatened by the mssons.\nThis, Mr.. Weed fully and explicitly denes-so\nthat one cause of reproach is taken from the mason\nic character.\n\n\n| The Editor Of the Rochester Telegraph complains\nof the late proceedings Of the Grand Chapter upon\nthis subject and says the language of their resolu-\ntons, sc. is cold and cquvocal. He also says that\nthere were men sitting in that body, whose hands\nwere reeking with Morgan's blood. Now we have\none simple question TO ask II those gentlemen at\nthe West know with so much certainty, who were\nengaged in the affair, and they tell US they know,\nard publish their nitials-why do they not procure\ntheir arrest? Where are the Grand Juries? What\nhas become OF the officers and Ministers Of Justice\nat the Westa We must confess that the mystery\nincreases, and those who have undertaken 10 bring\nthe truth to tight. have yet only increased the\ndarkness.\n\n\n| The foregoing article was prepared thus fer two\nor three days ago, but has been unavoidably delay\ncd Meantime, the western papers have furnished\nUS sundry additional articles respeetng Morgan, to-\ngether with the proceedings of three more Nor\ngan meetings.\" as they termed. One of these\nmeetings was held at Canandaeua on the 10th ult.\nOf which Henry Gushing Chairman and Oliver\nHearwell Secretary.
