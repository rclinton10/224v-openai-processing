In conformity with the\nprovisions of the law, the Managers pro-\nceeded to discharge the trust confided 70\nthem. After this period the Managers u.\nnites,, in opinion, that one Of them should\nsign the Tickets, and receive and make pay\nment of prizes. Unfortunately for me, or.\nas the self-created Trustees would have it,\nfor the Church, was selected for that pur-\npose, the residue OF the Managers giving me\ntheir bond of indemnity against any loss in\nthe performance of that duty.\n\n\nThe Scheme of this Lottery was sold to\nThomas Hope, Broker, by. and with the\nconsent OF the Managers, for the sum of\nthree thousand dollars--to be drawn in Six\nclasses, payable $500 at the drawing OF each\nclass. Under that arrangement Mr.. Hope\nwent on, and drew two classes. For those\ntwo classes paid the Church in cash and\nNote, and payment of her debts the full a\nmount and upwards, say sixteen hundred\nand five dollars and fourteen cents. The\nThird class of this Lottery. was subsequent\nly under the direction of Patrick Higgins,\nand conducted by him, and many OF the tick\ncts in that class remained upsold. The prl-\n2es in that class was called on tor, and OBJ\nlged to pay; by my signing, ! was pledged\nTO redeem them. On Hope failing in his en-\nragemeEts the Fourth class was sold to\nMessrs Yates and MIntyre. The money\nreceived for the class drawn by them, ac\ncording to contract, was applied (and paid)\nto the deficiency of the Sd class, conducted\nby Patrick Higgins. All OF these facts.\nremain ready and willing to make appear in\nj\nbut 7ohich has never been commenced, altho'\nso boldly asserted.\n\n\nAs to the denunciation of my services, by\nthose \"Trustees'', it is truly ridiculous.\nknow of no powers they possess to grant to\nme. Ely hozverS are from higher aud\nmore respectable source.

The introduction of negro\nslavery into the United States was not the work\nOF the present generation. The system was en-\ntailed upon them by their ancestors: and Justice\n| demands the admission, that evils, both moral\nand political, are more easily discovered than re-\nmoved; and that those who arc subjected, by\nthe circumstances of their birth, to the hard al\nTentative, either to new model the habits which\n! have grown with their years, or to maintain\nsystem which their sober judgments cannot an\nprove, are objects of sympathy with the truly\nchristian mind.\n\n\nThe .iealouses and antpatlles which the dis\n| tlnction between slave-holding and non slave\n| holding states has cngendered and fed, may be\nsafely cassed among the disastrous concomitants\nOF the system; especially as they oppose stub\nborn obstacle to any general effort for the reno\nval OF the other acknowledged evils of slavery.\nUnhapply for the cause of humanity, the advo-\n! cate Of the slave has been too often identified\nwith the antag mist Of his owner The interests\nOF these opposite classes have been considered\nas incompatible, and friendship for tile one AS\nsynonymous with enmty for the other.\n\n\nTO soften or remove those antiquities, and\npromote, between the inhabitants Of the differ\ncni sections of our country, community of feel\n\n\ning on this momentuous subject, is an object Of\nvital Importance, worthy Of the efforts of those\nwho seek alike the good of all.

In conformity with the\nprovisions of the law, the Managers pro-\nceeded to discharge the trust confided 70\nthem. After this period the Managers u.\nnites,, in opinion, that one Of them should\nsign the Tickets, and receive and make pay\nment of prizes. Unfortunately for me, or.\nas the self-created Trustees would have it,\nfor the Church, was selected for that pur-\npose, the residue OF the Managers giving me\ntheir bond of indemnity against any loss in\nthe performance of that duty.\n\n\nThe Scheme of this Lottery was sold to\nThomas Hope, Broker, by. and with the\nconsent OF the Managers, for the sum of\nthree thousand dollars--to be drawn in Six\nclasses, payable $500 at the drawing OF each\nclass. Under that arrangement Mr.. Hope\nwent on, and drew two classes. For those\ntwo classes paid the Church in cash and\nNote, and payment of her debts the full a\nmount and upwards, say sixteen hundred\nand five dollars and fourteen cents. The\nThird class of this Lottery. was subsequent\nly under the direction of Patrick Higgins,\nand conducted by him, and many OF the tick\ncts in that class remained upsold. The prl-\n2es in that class was called on tor, and OBJ\nlged to pay; by my signing, ! was pledged\nTO redeem them. On Hope failing in his en-\nragemeEts the Fourth class was sold to\nMessrs Yates and MIntyre. The money\nreceived for the class drawn by them, ac\ncording to contract, was applied (and paid)\nto the deficiency of the Sd class, conducted\nby Patrick Higgins. All OF these facts.\nremain ready and willing to make appear in\nj\nbut 7ohich has never been commenced, altho'\nso boldly asserted.\n\n\nAs to the denunciation of my services, by\nthose \"Trustees'', it is truly ridiculous.\nknow of no powers they possess to grant to\nme. Ely hozverS are from higher aud\nmore respectable source. Those men need\nemployment themselves, and they viii pro-\nbadly receive it, of that kind in legal wav\nnot comfortable to them. a part of the JAuaa\nOf the Church, would, no doubt, be very con\nvenient to our \"Gentlemen Trustees\" but\nwhich it is hoped the good sense OF the con-\ngregation will prevent them from handling:\nand az very unfortunate indeed would 1t be for\nthe Church, to confide her concerns in such\nhands, goho have not sufficient discretion to\nconduct their own affairs. would observe,\nthat no dissatisfaction would have arose, but\ntor two disorganizing members, one OF whom\nundertook to perform part i'll the Lottery,\nwhich his incapacty untitled him for, where\nby he was abandoued; and he did not reap",
