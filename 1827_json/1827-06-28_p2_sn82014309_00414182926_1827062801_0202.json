This IS moi the doctrine of \"doing as we would be done by\" Nay, it is downright opposition to this sacred principle.\n\n We do believe, that the spirit of our holy religion will eventually Overturn every throne on earth, which is not erected by the free consent of the people who are to be governed by it that it will lay aside every crown, and star, and all the glittering distinction of kings and princes and nObles-thOse baubles which swell the hearts of some with pride, but make others sweat blood in order to procure them. Not that Christianity will effect this by scdl- ton and treason; less still, by violence or bIoodshed. No; the principles which 1t in- cuIcates, can never approve or allow of these. Men of different principles from those Ot our religion, resort to means like these. Atheism and Deism have once attempted, m our day, remedy for the evils of despOtism; but the remedy proved to be worse than the disease. After millions of victims had bled upon the al- tar of what they called liberty, their VOWS were still unpaid, and their prayers unaccep- ted. LIBERTY had indeed been inscribed upon the banners which led their van hut the rear marched under the bloody flag, with the destroying angel at their head,\n\n Not so will Christianity achieve her victo- res. Thrones will fall before her all thrones, as believe, because do not see how a Christian community, universally enlight- ened, and capable of governing themselves, can ever prefer a monarchical form of gov ernment to republican one. All princes and nobles will renouce their idle distinctions, and their ill-founded and arrogant claims. But all will be voluntdrily done. When the march of truth shall advance through every country r; when Christian light and Christian feeling shall be diffused among every class of the community, so that all may safely come to enjoy the liberty wherewith Christ makes his followers free; then will crumble to dust every hereditary throne; and every claim to hereditary priviledges, and honors, and rights (that of property excepted,) will be spurned from society. The very idea of doing to others that which we desire them to do to us, must banish every claim of this nature from the face of the earth, just as far as this principle extends.\n\n No wonder, then, that despots, and the claimants great and small of hereditary rights and privileges and honours, in the old world, are jealous of the progress ofvital Christiani- tv, All those forms of it, which acknowl- edge the divine rights of kings and nobles,\n\n \n\n take deep interest in fostering them. But let that form of our religion shew itself which insists that there is neither Jew nor Greek, Barbarian nor Sythian, bond nor free, i. e., that there are no vassals and no lords, and they summon all their rage and all their em- battlcd hosts to crush it. Here is the grand secret of enmity among them to Bible Socie- ties, and to evangelical missionary opera tons. The people must not be taught a knowledge of their rights, or the principles of Christian freedom or equality. This will make the throne to totter it will tarnish the gttering star and garter. Nay, it would come. at last to the tremendous result, that magistrates must be appointed by the peo- ple and for the people, and solely for the purpose of promoting their interest and wei fare, to labor for their good; mot to prey upon them, to riot in the spells of their hard earned substance.\n\n Who can deny, now, that the despOts of the old world are sagacious in respect to this subject! Their conduct shews we'll that they fear the worst for their claims and their ina munities,should pure evangelical truth prevail. They certainly have great reasons for their fears for \"where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty\"\n\n It is no adequate reply to all this to say that the Bible requires us to 'honor the king\" and declares, that \"the powers which be are ordained of God\" acknowledge that such precepts and declarations are found in it {; and rejoice that they are. But look for a moment at the object of them. Christ came to establish moral kingdom on earth. His followers fora long time, were few, feeble and persecuted. Among them, originally, Jews were almost every where intermingled; who never submitted, without great reluctance and indignation, to the yoke of heather pow CT. Regarding themselves as the peculiar and favorite people of God, they felt subjection to a Pagan power to be dishonor. and a griev- ance too great to be endured and they were ready, on every slight occasion, to murmur and exhibit a seditious spirit The Christian Jews needed great caution on this subject.\n\n Besides, the early Christians had no parti- cipation, generally in the affairs of civil gov eInment; nor was there any free government in existence during the first ages of our holy religion. The civil powers then in being were, more commonly hostile to Christians. Of what avail then could resistance be, when made by mere handful of men, against the mighty empire of Rome? Nay, how could resistance any way be made, (except by se- dition or rebellion) against government where no elective franchise was enjoyed r. And how could such franchise be claimed; before the majority of the citizens became Christians\n\n Is it any wonder, then, that religion, which in its very nature is designed to pro- -A-aa-",

She sailed, as a. bove stated, coiIu'andod by Henry Bright man one of the owners. with Edmund Dob son, the mate, and four men before the mast named Oliver Potter. Asa Bicknel, Joseph Deliver and Nathan -, aud ti.o eAnk, There were also eight passengers, to wit, Norman Robinson, of Connnecticut, an l. rishman, and man belonging to Provi- dence, both of whom were carpenters a Frenchman named Alexander T'drdy, another Frenchman and three Spaniards. Consid- erable money was also brought on board, and the whole of the cargo was consigned to G. G. S; s. Rowland, of New-York, & Crawford Allen of Providence. Nothing particularly occurred until the morning of the Slst, when at the solicitation of Tardy, the only foreigner of the five last named who could speak English, one of the Span iards was called upon to assist in getting breakfast ; and after Capt. B.. the mate, end MT. Robinson had ate, they were all taken sick, and Capt. B. suspected that some design was practised upon his life. On the morning of the 1st of June. about 9 o'clock, the awful fracas commenced with the aforesaid Tardy, and the three Spaniards, on the captain and the crew, by stabbing and throwing them overheard. Dobson, Potter and the Cook, all having been stabbed as we'll as the others, got up to the vessels crosstrees, the Cook for ward, and bleeding, heard the groans of the wounded below, and heard them thrown overheard. MT. Robinson and Nathan jumped overheard, the former out of the cabin window and Potter being mortalIy wounded, fell from the masthead over board. On Tardy's learning that Mir. Dobson was aloft he prevailed upon him to come down upon deck and promised his life; MT. DobsOn at length came down and knowing that the others were not nav igators or sailors, felt himself in some re- spects, safe, from the circumstance in which he was placed as first officer. All the vessels papers, letters, books, were destroyed; colors thrown away, and name defaced from the stern, and new set of papers in Spanish, corresponding with the vessel, were produced, Spanish manifest made out in which the vessel has new name given her, to be commanded Sy the said Tardy; and after making a small Spanish ensign of some bunting which they had brought on board, ,Tardy then told Mir. Dob son that they must sail for Hamburg. Find ing, however, that they would require more provisions, they concluded to put into Saint Mary's in Georgia, Tardy saying he did not like to go to Savanna or Charleston, flor there he was known--Ehe was naturalized in Charleston, and Mr. D. saw his paper,1 but would proceed for the Chesapeake.

Sir: The story of the man of his Maiesty's 71st Regiment, falling overheard from the Chambly boat, between Long Point and Montreal, and so miraculously appearing 1 on the beach before his comrades had disem- parked, reminded me of a circumstance that occurred during my service on board the Dolphin man of war, bound to the West-In- dies. We were going at the rate of about g knots and half an hour, when Tom Gar board, belonging to the foretOp (who by the by was bit of a wag,) sleeping in the lee fore chains, by sudden lurch of the ship was thrown overheard,\n\n A man overheard was the general cry fore and aft-and every one ran to offer or to give their assistance to the drowning man.\n\n Tom, who was telerable good swimmer, as every body thought, but nothing extra ordinary, woke on finding himself in deep wa ter, and began to. use his paddles, the ship passing ahead as was saying before, at the rate of knots and half. Tom was soon lost sight of under the counter, (for although our ship was not on Sir Robert Sepping's pIdI1s yet Suc WdS lu Clty HUH oU0tlJ \"NCH OAA was lucky enough to get hold of the rudder- chains. The hands all run aft, expecting to see Tom astern, and to lower the jolly boat down to pick him up; but no Tom was to be seen. 'r1U-o y~->~ ,'' n~;A they \"to 'Dayy's locker\" and efforts ceased.\n\n Our ship was deep, bound out to the West Indies, consequently our gun room ports were low in the water. This Tom saw, and as it was getting dark, he thought he'd wait till they had beat to quarters, and piped the hammocks down before he got on board, which he did, and then popped down into the lady's hold, (where the gunner keeps his wads and spare monkeys tails( and there remained till the middle of the first watch, when he saled forth, made free with our bread bags, and took enOngh to last him for three days. At the end of this time, we were jogging along at an easy rate, with scarcely any wind, about a knot, when Tom, dropping astern, began to hail the ship. \"The Dolphin, ahoy 2\" /\" Hallo,\" said the quarter master, who was about getting a haul upon the mainbrace. Says Tom, \"If you don't back the maintop- sail, and heave too, I shall sink, for no man can swim to the West Indies without provis- ions.''\n\n Every body ran aft in amazement; for it had been blowing fresh during the time we had supposed he had been overheard, but there was no time to be lost-so the boat was lowered, and poor Tom picked up to the great qualification & astonishment ofeyery body on board.\n\n On our arrival as the captain was on shore dining with the Governor, the talk turned up on swimming. The Governor was extolling the powers of black man he had, and our Captain swore that no man could swim with Tom Cardboard, of the Dolphin's foretop :; however. to make a long story short the Captain and the Governor made heavy bet -the time appointed-Tom asked one week to get ready.\n\n The carpenters were ordered to make what chests and conveniences Tom required. The purser was instructed at his request, 10 supply fortnight's provisions. The day came, and Tom went on shore at the wharf appointed, where he began to stow his grub. The black fellow looked at him with aston ishment. \"What do you here, massa ? says he--\" what am l doing here.\" says Tom, \"why I'm taking in my provisions, to be sure and advise you to do the same /: for damn the bit of this do you get on the road\" \"Why, massa,\" says the negro, \"me no swim more nine or ten miles,\" \".Nine or ten milss!\" says Tom, as fin amazement at the short distance, \"why, man, I'm going to To bago, which. which believe is over two hun dred miles. and shant be back for fort night\"\n\n The spectators were astounded. The black refused to swim. The Governor lost his wager, and it was not until we were homeward bound, that Tom told the se- cret.\n\n ",

He (Mr. PeeD had therefore felt it right to retire from the station he had fed.'\n\n Sir F. Burdett succeeded Mir.

Mir. Dawson con- tinued to speak with warmth and iadscretion some time longer; and when he sat down, Mir. Brougham rose and said in regard to his supporting Mr. Can nng's views, it could not be from interested motives, for :\" have dreamed of taking office under the present arrangement. l am much more certainly and inevetabiy out of offce-and out of office, am more likely to reman--than the honorable gentleman him. -l,1V, oIa ernment though go no further 1 must be charged with an unnatural coaton.' Mir. Brougham, in the of his remarks paid very high compliment to Mir. Peel.\n\n Mr. Canning closed the debate in triumphant speech, in which he vindicated his cause with mani- ness sincerity, and decision. He reciprocated warm y the expressions of Mir. Peel and he declared that when the occasion for forming new ministry, he Mr. C. advised the King to form it on ant'-catotc grounds tendering at the same time his own reslgna- tonthe king refused the advice, and directed him to form administration the same footing of neutral ty, to this question, to Lord Liverpools That he attempted to do, but was measuraby prevented by the withdrawal of the Protestant portion of the cab net six of whose resignations he received in the ve \" bedroom of the king-among them, that ot Lord Eldon that in this embarrassment, he again expres- sed to the King his desire that Cabinet might be for med without him, (Mr. O. if his being there was an obstacle that the Kings commands to him to go on with the business decisive, and that he had done He could not disguise, he said, that the Catholic these events, but still that could not induce him (Mr. O. to force il upon the House, when so large por- ton of the community, appeared opposed to it.\"\n\n The British Traveller speaks of MT.

            "article": "NNa CT were born merely for procuring the means for all this, by toil and by the sweat oL their brows, by priVation and suffering. This IS moi the doctrine of \"doing as we would be done by\" Nay, it is downright opposition to this sacred principle.\n\n We do believe, that the spirit of our holy religion will eventually Overturn every throne on earth, which is not erected by the free consent of the people who are to be governed by it that it will lay aside every crown, and star, and all the glittering distinction of kings and princes and nObles-thOse baubles which swell the hearts of some with pride, but make others sweat blood in order to procure them. Not that Christianity will effect this by scdl- ton and treason; less still, by violence or bIoodshed. No; the principles which 1t in- cuIcates, can never approve or allow of these. Men of different principles from those Ot our religion, resort to means like these. Atheism and Deism have once attempted, m our day, remedy for the evils of despOtism; but the remedy proved to be worse than the disease. After millions of victims had bled upon the al- tar of what they called liberty, their VOWS were still unpaid, and their prayers unaccep- ted. LIBERTY had indeed been inscribed upon the banners which led their van hut the rear marched under the bloody flag, with the destroying angel at their head,\n\n Not so will Christianity achieve her victo- res. Thrones will fall before her all thrones, as believe, because do not see how a Christian community, universally enlight- ened, and capable of governing themselves, can ever prefer a monarchical form of gov ernment to republican one. All princes and nobles will renouce their idle distinctions, and their ill-founded and arrogant claims. But all will be voluntdrily done. When the march of truth shall advance through every country r; when Christian light and Christian feeling shall be diffused among every class of the community, so that all may safely come to enjoy the liberty wherewith Christ makes his followers free; then will crumble to dust every hereditary throne; and every claim to hereditary priviledges, and honors, and rights (that of property excepted,) will be spurned from society. The very idea of doing to others that which we desire them to do to us, must banish every claim of this nature from the face of the earth, just as far as this principle extends.\n\n No wonder, then, that despots, and the claimants great and small of hereditary rights and privileges and honours, in the old world, are jealous of the progress ofvital Christiani- tv, All those forms of it, which acknowl- edge the divine rights of kings and nobles,\n\n \n\n take deep interest in fostering them. But let that form of our religion shew itself which insists that there is neither Jew nor Greek, Barbarian nor Sythian, bond nor free, i. e., that there are no vassals and no lords, and they summon all their rage and all their em- battlcd hosts to crush it. Here is the grand secret of enmity among them to Bible Socie- ties, and to evangelical missionary opera tons. The people must not be taught a knowledge of their rights, or the principles of Christian freedom or equality. This will make the throne to totter it will tarnish the gttering star and garter. Nay, it would come. at last to the tremendous result, that magistrates must be appointed by the peo- ple and for the people, and solely for the purpose of promoting their interest and wei fare, to labor for their good; mot to prey upon them, to riot in the spells of their hard earned substance.\n\n Who can deny, now, that the despOts of the old world are sagacious in respect to this subject! Their conduct shews we'll that they fear the worst for their claims and their ina munities,should pure evangelical truth prevail. They certainly have great reasons for their fears for \"where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty\"\n\n It is no adequate reply to all this to say that the Bible requires us to 'honor the king\" and declares, that \"the powers which be are ordained of God\" acknowledge that such precepts and declarations are found in it {; and rejoice that they are. But look for a moment at the object of them. Christ came to establish moral kingdom on earth. His followers fora long time, were few, feeble and persecuted. Among them, originally, Jews were almost every where intermingled; who never submitted, without great reluctance and indignation, to the yoke of heather pow CT. Regarding themselves as the peculiar and favorite people of God, they felt subjection to a Pagan power to be dishonor. and a griev- ance too great to be endured and they were ready, on every slight occasion, to murmur and exhibit a seditious spirit The Christian Jews needed great caution on this subject.\n\n Besides, the early Christians had no parti- cipation, generally in the affairs of civil gov eInment; nor was there any free government in existence during the first ages of our holy religion. The civil powers then in being were, more commonly hostile to Christians. Of what avail then could resistance be, when made by mere handful of men, against the mighty empire of Rome? Nay, how could resistance any way be made, (except by se- dition or rebellion) against government where no elective franchise was enjoyed r. And how could such franchise be claimed; before the majority of the citizens became Christians\n\n Is it any wonder, then, that religion, which in its very nature is designed to pro- -A-aa-",

She sailed, as a. bove stated, coiIu'andod by Henry Bright man one of the owners. with Edmund Dob son, the mate, and four men before the mast named Oliver Potter. Asa Bicknel, Joseph Deliver and Nathan -, aud ti.o eAnk, There were also eight passengers, to wit, Norman Robinson, of Connnecticut, an l. rishman, and man belonging to Provi- dence, both of whom were carpenters a Frenchman named Alexander T'drdy, another Frenchman and three Spaniards. Consid- erable money was also brought on board, and the whole of the cargo was consigned to G. G. S; s. Rowland, of New-York, & Crawford Allen of Providence. Nothing particularly occurred until the morning of the Slst, when at the solicitation of Tardy, the only foreigner of the five last named who could speak English, one of the Span iards was called upon to assist in getting breakfast ; and after Capt. B.. the mate, end MT. Robinson had ate, they were all taken sick, and Capt. B. suspected that some design was practised upon his life. On the morning of the 1st of June. about 9 o'clock, the awful fracas commenced with the aforesaid Tardy, and the three Spaniards, on the captain and the crew, by stabbing and throwing them overheard. Dobson, Potter and the Cook, all having been stabbed as we'll as the others, got up to the vessels crosstrees, the Cook for ward, and bleeding, heard the groans of the wounded below, and heard them thrown overheard. MT. Robinson and Nathan jumped overheard, the former out of the cabin window and Potter being mortalIy wounded, fell from the masthead over board. On Tardy's learning that Mir. Dobson was aloft he prevailed upon him to come down upon deck and promised his life; MT. DobsOn at length came down and knowing that the others were not nav igators or sailors, felt himself in some re- spects, safe, from the circumstance in which he was placed as first officer. All the vessels papers, letters, books, were destroyed; colors thrown away, and name defaced from the stern, and new set of papers in Spanish, corresponding with the vessel, were produced, Spanish manifest made out in which the vessel has new name given her, to be commanded Sy the said Tardy; and after making a small Spanish ensign of some bunting which they had brought on board, ,Tardy then told Mir. Dob son that they must sail for Hamburg. Find ing, however, that they would require more provisions, they concluded to put into Saint Mary's in Georgia, Tardy saying he did not like to go to Savanna or Charleston, flor there he was known--Ehe was naturalized in Charleston, and Mr. D. saw his paper,1 but would proceed for the Chesapeake.

Sir: The story of the man of his Maiesty's 71st Regiment, falling overheard from the Chambly boat, between Long Point and Montreal, and so miraculously appearing 1 on the beach before his comrades had disem- parked, reminded me of a circumstance that occurred during my service on board the Dolphin man of war, bound to the West-In- dies. We were going at the rate of about g knots and half an hour, when Tom Gar board, belonging to the foretOp (who by the by was bit of a wag,) sleeping in the lee fore chains, by sudden lurch of the ship was thrown overheard,\n\n A man overheard was the general cry fore and aft-and every one ran to offer or to give their assistance to the drowning man.\n\n Tom, who was telerable good swimmer, as every body thought, but nothing extra ordinary, woke on finding himself in deep wa ter, and began to. use his paddles, the ship passing ahead as was saying before, at the rate of knots and half. Tom was soon lost sight of under the counter, (for although our ship was not on Sir Robert Sepping's pIdI1s yet Suc WdS lu Clty HUH oU0tlJ \"NCH OAA was lucky enough to get hold of the rudder- chains. The hands all run aft, expecting to see Tom astern, and to lower the jolly boat down to pick him up; but no Tom was to be seen. 'r1U-o y~->~ ,'' n~;A they \"to 'Dayy's locker\" and efforts ceased.\n\n Our ship was deep, bound out to the West Indies, consequently our gun room ports were low in the water. This Tom saw, and as it was getting dark, he thought he'd wait till they had beat to quarters, and piped the hammocks down before he got on board, which he did, and then popped down into the lady's hold, (where the gunner keeps his wads and spare monkeys tails( and there remained till the middle of the first watch, when he saled forth, made free with our bread bags, and took enOngh to last him for three days. At the end of this time, we were jogging along at an easy rate, with scarcely any wind, about a knot, when Tom, dropping astern, began to hail the ship. \"The Dolphin, ahoy 2\" /\" Hallo,\" said the quarter master, who was about getting a haul upon the mainbrace. Says Tom, \"If you don't back the maintop- sail, and heave too, I shall sink, for no man can swim to the West Indies without provis- ions.''\n\n Every body ran aft in amazement; for it had been blowing fresh during the time we had supposed he had been overheard, but there was no time to be lost-so the boat was lowered, and poor Tom picked up to the great qualification & astonishment ofeyery body on board.\n\n On our arrival as the captain was on shore dining with the Governor, the talk turned up on swimming. The Governor was extolling the powers of black man he had, and our Captain swore that no man could swim with Tom Cardboard, of the Dolphin's foretop :; however. to make a long story short the Captain and the Governor made heavy bet -the time appointed-Tom asked one week to get ready.\n\n The carpenters were ordered to make what chests and conveniences Tom required. The purser was instructed at his request, 10 supply fortnight's provisions. The day came, and Tom went on shore at the wharf appointed, where he began to stow his grub. The black fellow looked at him with aston ishment. \"What do you here, massa ? says he--\" what am l doing here.\" says Tom, \"why I'm taking in my provisions, to be sure and advise you to do the same /: for damn the bit of this do you get on the road\" \"Why, massa,\" says the negro, \"me no swim more nine or ten miles,\" \".Nine or ten milss!\" says Tom, as fin amazement at the short distance, \"why, man, I'm going to To bago, which. which believe is over two hun dred miles. and shant be back for fort night\"\n\n The spectators were astounded. The black refused to swim. The Governor lost his wager, and it was not until we were homeward bound, that Tom told the se- cret.\n\n ",
