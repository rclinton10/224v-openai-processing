Your correspondent ~ appears from\nhis solution to suppose that dollars multiplied\nby dollars make dollars. Where he got this\nfrom, will not pretend 70 say, but ~ the\nsame rule we could have cents multiplied BY\ncents make cents; dimes by times make\ndimes; and eagles by eagles make eagles;\nApplying this to the present question we\nhave 500 cents multiplied BY 500 cents. re-\nsuit. $50 900 cents, or $500 dollars. 80 dimes\n(or 500 cents multiplied BY 30 dimes, make\n$500 dimes or $40 dollars. S dollars multi\npiled by 5 dollars make 25 dollars We may\nmake as many dVeyent results as we please.\nHow then is it that the same question work\ncd by the same rule should bring such va\nrious answers. This rule must be false, for\ntruth is always consistent with itself. In\nmultiplication, the multipler denotes the\nnumber of times the multiplicand is to be\nen-, and must therefore be an abstract\nnumber and neither cents, cow, or grind\nstones. The product might be obtained IN q\nmore tedious manner, by putting down the\nmultiplieand tho number Of times indicated\nby the multiplier, aud finding the result\nBut to talk of putting it down the number OF\ntimes indicated by 500 cents, SO dimes, or s\ni J,l,.,\n\n\nMs question is, if possible, more absurd\nthan the former one. for he requires us te\ntake the multiplicaud a number OF times in\ndcated by long train Of dollars, dimes\ncents, and mills. n understands his uwr\nrule he certainly must be able to explain it\nand also to inform me what is the result o.\n500 wheelbarrows multiplied by 500 steam\nengines. 7.",
