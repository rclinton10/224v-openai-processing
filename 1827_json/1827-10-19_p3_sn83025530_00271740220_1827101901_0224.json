Russian wheat being smaller in the berry\nthan any other Sort very coarse and brown, very\nhardly dressed, and with much dirt in it, can seldom\nbe used in England for any other purpose than the\nmanufacture ofthe coarsest biscuit bread. At Arch\nangel there are seldom any stocks of corn ofany i'm\nportance and the season of receiving supplies from\nthe interior being limited to the few weeks when the\nrivers are swollen by the melting OF the SHOWS, and\nthe distances being immense, the expense OF carriage\nwould, at very low prices, absorb nearly half the\nvalue. AT ST. Petersburgh the consumption takes\noff the greatest portion ofthe supplies and at Riga\nthe inferior quality Of the wheat checks its exporto\nGreat Britain. Prussia produces much wheat; but\nthough it, with other grain, forms principal object\nof trade there the prices for the last few years have\nnot afforded sufficient inducement to the growers\nand the supplies have much decreased Here, also,\nthe peri a of supply is only while the rivers are\nswollen. Though Dantzic is celebrated for the\nquality of its wheat the prices have OF late been\nso ruinously low that with the cost OF transporta-\nton, they have greatly diminished its culture. The\nDanish wheat is coarse and damp. The Hanse\nTozuns have many corn merchants, and capacious\ngranaries. Hamburg receives large supplies, and\nfrom great distance, by river navigation and\nfrom the great general business between and Great\nBritain, there is constant trade in corn. Any de-\ntciency in England causes supplies to be ordered\nthence before any port except Rotterdam. Hdno-\nyer and Ernbden afford indifferent wheats. In the\n\n\nNetherlands there is great internal corn trade ;\nbut the wheats from Amsterdam, Rotterdam and\n| Antwerp are usually dear, and generally too high\npriced. in comparison with the English markets, to\n\n\nbe sent to the latter The trade in of all sorts\n\n\nbetween England and France, is very trihing, the\n\n\npopulation of the latter being about equal to con\n\n\nsumo its produce.

Russian wheat being smaller in the berry\nthan any other Sort very coarse and brown, very\nhardly dressed, and with much dirt in it, can seldom\nbe used in England for any other purpose than the\nmanufacture ofthe coarsest biscuit bread. At Arch\nangel there are seldom any stocks of corn ofany i'm\nportance and the season of receiving supplies from\nthe interior being limited to the few weeks when the\nrivers are swollen by the melting OF the SHOWS, and\nthe distances being immense, the expense OF carriage\nwould, at very low prices, absorb nearly half the\nvalue. AT ST. Petersburgh the consumption takes\noff the greatest portion ofthe supplies and at Riga\nthe inferior quality Of the wheat checks its exporto\nGreat Britain. Prussia produces much wheat; but\nthough it, with other grain, forms principal object\nof trade there the prices for the last few years have\nnot afforded sufficient inducement to the growers\nand the supplies have much decreased Here, also,\nthe peri a of supply is only while the rivers are\nswollen. Though Dantzic is celebrated for the\nquality of its wheat the prices have OF late been\nso ruinously low that with the cost OF transporta-\nton, they have greatly diminished its culture. The\nDanish wheat is coarse and damp. The Hanse\nTozuns have many corn merchants, and capacious\ngranaries. Hamburg receives large supplies, and\nfrom great distance, by river navigation and\nfrom the great general business between and Great\nBritain, there is constant trade in corn. Any de-\ntciency in England causes supplies to be ordered\nthence before any port except Rotterdam. Hdno-\nyer and Ernbden afford indifferent wheats. In the\n\n\nNetherlands there is great internal corn trade ;\nbut the wheats from Amsterdam, Rotterdam and\n| Antwerp are usually dear, and generally too high\npriced. in comparison with the English markets, to\n\n\nbe sent to the latter The trade in of all sorts\n\n\nbetween England and France, is very trihing, the\n\n\npopulation of the latter being about equal to con\n\n\nsumo its produce.
