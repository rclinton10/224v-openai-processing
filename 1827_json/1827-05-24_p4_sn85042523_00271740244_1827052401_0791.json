Many persons rely upon the teel OF\nthe horn, as the best indicative OF the dis-\nease, but this, | think very uncertain; ~\nsone cases it il At the root, cold to the feel,\nwhile in others very hot A very small\neinblet will, however, remove all doubts,\naud the mark on the horn not vlsl-\nbic after a few days.

The day following, the horns\nmust be again opened and cleaned from tho\npus, which generally is new formed, and\nabout half a tea spoonful of spirits OF turpen-\nsine, put into each horn, and little on the\npoll Of the animal daily, during the contnu-\nance of the disease. One bleeding is gcner-\nally sufficient; but have known cases in\nwhich it was necessary to repeat it three\ntimes, as also the salts.\n\n\nThe food during the continuance OF the\ndisease is important-con in every shape\nis bad-potatoes are of great use, (wlth a\nsmall qSantity of Brewers grains, # to be\nhad) and the animal ought to have from one\nto one and half pecks daily with hay IN\nthe winter, and grass II IN summer\n\n\nPotatoes have a wonderful effect on III.\nanimal as soon as the bowels are well cleans\ned, the importance of which, any persoT\nwill be Convinced of, who observes the dis\ncharge from the animal In some obstinate\ncases have given daily, from half to one\nounce of nitrr, sprink ed on the potatoes. Il\nIs important at the FIRST bleeding to take a.\nmuch blood as the animal will beal, as the\nfever is more easily checked by one large\nbleeding. than two small ones, and the nnin'\nal better able to bear il.\n\n\nIn many cases the bleeding and salts have\nbeen sufficient, without opening the horns\nand when taken in the early stage will gen\norally be found to answer, but the boarin!\ncertainly assists in tOrminE anew, the inter\nnal part Of the horn, and which, as soon a\nit commences forming, the holes il the horl\nshould be allowed to close.\n\n\nAn animal having the hollow horn, SHOULD\nbe sheltered from the nclemency Of tn\nweather, during its continuance. No ag\nappears exempt from its attack, havin\nseen it in a yearling as well as at subsequeu\nages. am induced to offer this mode {\ntreatment to your subscribers, having ueve\nin any instance failed Of restoring the amin\nal, whereas before this mode of treatmct\nwas adopted annually lost several.
