Jane had sent par ticnlar request for aH her young friends to contribute a page to her book. It had just returned, and Jane was now spending happy hour in admiriug the beautiful Renmanship, and the thousand good wish es, and expressions of never changing affection, which tlIe new selections con- tained. She seemed to feel sort of pride and consequence in being in possession of so valuable an article, as she gave the Album to the old lady who after passing com pliment upon the splendid outside, open ed the book, and began very leisurely to decypher the writing, which was executed in so fourishing hand, that her eyes, which had been accustomed to the fash- ions of another age, made as little progress as they would in demonstrating figure in Geometry. After reading few lines on each of half a dozen leaves, she return ed the book to her grand daughter, accom- panied with deep sigh, and the unefect- cd exclamation, 70, these degenerate days when I was young lady like you Miss Jane, my time was occupied in learning the substantial qualifications of good house keeper,-we had no silk dresses, or boarding schools, for fashionable ladies ]; not had the girls of that day any time to carry about such book as this for the gen. tlemen to write love songs in. have read several pieces in your Album, my dear, and have not found one which is worth remembering, or which will make you wiz ser, happier, or more useful. And I fear, Jane, when you become as old as I, you may look back upon the time spent about this book with very little satisfaction\" The closing remarks of the old lady were so sensible, and accordant with my own views on the subjecr, that I immediately determined to send few lines to your pa- per, for the use of young female readers.\n\n One can not help observing the preva- lence of bad taste, in almost every Album he opens. A lady'sselection usually con- sists of some superficial sonnet or stanza, wishing, \"peace happiness and prosperity\" and vowing everlasting friendship, \"from your dear friend.\"-And the gentlemen, in the true spirit of chivalry, contribute verse from the love sick effusions, or impi- cities, of Moor and Byron, while some child, with better taste, will select pious hymn from one of her school books. Among the great number of these books which have come under my observation, not more than one in ten could be strictly said to have a prepondera.ing, moral, or happy in- fuence upon its possessor. Instead of these milk-and- productions, 1 would recommend to all my fair readers plan, which has been found by many young people ofboti sexes, to be eminently useful and instructive,yiz. a commonplace book.

We have seen it in print, and every circumstance relating to the General is in- teresting to the people of his native State we annex it.\n\n In the French and Indian War of 1755, Putnam, then a captain, and brother off cer, were sent to reconnoitre the camp of the enemy. Impelled by an ungovernable anxiety to ascertain the precise situation of the foe they approached so near their lines as to be discovered. Immediate and swift pursuit was commenced by par ty of about 20 Indians. The Americans were young and active, and for the first mile they gained on their adversaries, but knowing well the capacity of the savages for continuing and even increasing their speed ,and fearful of being ultimately over- taken, they ascending lofty pine, and concealed themselves among its branches. It was nearly dark, and they were effeetu- ally hid from observation, while the move- ments of the Indians were distinctly visi-. ble. They collected around the tree, ut tering horrid yells, and searching in vain for the fugitives. While Rogers, the com- panion of Putnam, was silent in breath- less suspense, Putnam changed his posi- ton, so as to have fair aim at his ene- mics, cooked his musket, and prepared to fire. Rogers saw the temerity of the act, and said in. a whisper. .y -..-~ -..\n\n \"Hold, Putnam, for the love of Heaven 1!\n\n you cannot kill more than one of the sava-\n\n ges, and our destruction will be inevita- ble! echoed Putnam. with his usual as- servation, and in a tone far too vociferous for their dangerous situation; {\" what do cares for thatl Heavens curse blight the Y ho1f pF them. :\" .'\" And it was only at the earnest and repeat ed entreaties of Rogers, that he was in- duced to forego his plan, and remain quiet until the savages had retired, when they descended the tree, and returned to the camp in safety.-Mid.

It was in the year 251, B. 0. that elephants were first introduced into the cireus,' by Metellus, berg those recently mentioned as captured in Sicily From this period, (says our author,) the passion for public ex- hibitions and combats of wild beasts, spread not only in Italy, but throughout the Roman empire in all the provinces\" Such was the general rage, that scarcely a. fixed military station was without its circus or amphithea-' tre of turf or timber.\n\n The circular form of the amphitheatre was changed ny Julius Cesar for the elliptical, and thereafter such buildings were called theatres for hunting. They were also used for the combats of gladiators, as their acccommoda- tions were so much better than the circular buidings.-They were still however called circus, as often as by other names. Some were little more than notvral Ualleys, with benches cut in the surrounding hills others were elliptical excavations, with benches of turf like that near Sandwich in Kent; some were partly excavated, and partly construc- ted with masonry, like the amphitheatre at Caerlon in Britain. There were also amphi- theatres constructed to hold water for the combat of aquatic and amphibious animals. When these buildings were of timber, they were erected orremOved as occasion required. CapiOdorus states that Vespasian spent as much on one as would have built capital ci- ty; and Martial relates that Roman citizens crowded from all parts of the empire td be present at these exhibitions. .l\n\n The amphithcatres were supplied with wild beasts from the remotest provinces Of the ena- plre, and with :he most rare and singular ais- imals. without regard to their size or ferociots nature. Lions, tigers, bears. and hyenas, were brought, in what appears almost incredible numbers; the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopo- tamus. and camelOpard; stags and deer of every description; zebras, wild asses. ostrich and even the crocodile of the Nile, were all produced at different times & in various nnnn- bers to be exhibited IS objects of curiosity. to be hunted by the people in the theatre. or slaughtered in the combat with each other.\n\n The diversions were of three kinds In the first the anfphitheatre was cOnserted into a lrnslrespDtatiOn cf a natural f0fNsf hv 9neMuN Of",

Jane had sent par ticnlar request for aH her young friends to contribute a page to her book. It had just returned, and Jane was now spending happy hour in admiriug the beautiful Renmanship, and the thousand good wish es, and expressions of never changing affection, which tlIe new selections con- tained. She seemed to feel sort of pride and consequence in being in possession of so valuable an article, as she gave the Album to the old lady who after passing com pliment upon the splendid outside, open ed the book, and began very leisurely to decypher the writing, which was executed in so fourishing hand, that her eyes, which had been accustomed to the fash- ions of another age, made as little progress as they would in demonstrating figure in Geometry. After reading few lines on each of half a dozen leaves, she return ed the book to her grand daughter, accom- panied with deep sigh, and the unefect- cd exclamation, 70, these degenerate days when I was young lady like you Miss Jane, my time was occupied in learning the substantial qualifications of good house keeper,-we had no silk dresses, or boarding schools, for fashionable ladies ]; not had the girls of that day any time to carry about such book as this for the gen. tlemen to write love songs in. have read several pieces in your Album, my dear, and have not found one which is worth remembering, or which will make you wiz ser, happier, or more useful. And I fear, Jane, when you become as old as I, you may look back upon the time spent about this book with very little satisfaction\" The closing remarks of the old lady were so sensible, and accordant with my own views on the subjecr, that I immediately determined to send few lines to your pa- per, for the use of young female readers.\n\n One can not help observing the preva- lence of bad taste, in almost every Album he opens. A lady'sselection usually con- sists of some superficial sonnet or stanza, wishing, \"peace happiness and prosperity\" and vowing everlasting friendship, \"from your dear friend.\"-And the gentlemen, in the true spirit of chivalry, contribute verse from the love sick effusions, or impi- cities, of Moor and Byron, while some child, with better taste, will select pious hymn from one of her school books. Among the great number of these books which have come under my observation, not more than one in ten could be strictly said to have a prepondera.ing, moral, or happy in- fuence upon its possessor. Instead of these milk-and- productions, 1 would recommend to all my fair readers plan, which has been found by many young people ofboti sexes, to be eminently useful and instructive,yiz. a commonplace book. There are no persons but what can obtain useful books to read and have time for wri- ting aHd by having book at hand, when they come to an interesting passage in a. ny author, they may possess what is valu- able to them in whole library and by a little care in management, make it very ea- sy of reference.

Impelled by an ungovernable anxiety to ascertain the precise situation of the foe they approached so near their lines as to be discovered. Immediate and swift pursuit was commenced by par ty of about 20 Indians. The Americans were young and active, and for the first mile they gained on their adversaries, but knowing well the capacity of the savages for continuing and even increasing their speed ,and fearful of being ultimately over- taken, they ascending lofty pine, and concealed themselves among its branches. It was nearly dark, and they were effeetu- ally hid from observation, while the move- ments of the Indians were distinctly visi-. ble. They collected around the tree, ut tering horrid yells, and searching in vain for the fugitives. While Rogers, the com- panion of Putnam, was silent in breath- less suspense, Putnam changed his posi- ton, so as to have fair aim at his ene- mics, cooked his musket, and prepared to fire. Rogers saw the temerity of the act, and said in. a whisper. .y -..-~ -..\n\n \"Hold, Putnam, for the love of Heaven 1!\n\n you cannot kill more than one of the sava-\n\n ges, and our destruction will be inevita- ble! echoed Putnam. with his usual as- servation, and in a tone far too vociferous for their dangerous situation; {\" what do cares for thatl Heavens curse blight the Y ho1f pF them. :\" .'\" And it was only at the earnest and repeat ed entreaties of Rogers, that he was in- duced to forego his plan, and remain quiet until the savages had retired, when they descended the tree, and returned to the camp in safety.-Mid.

She was brought up for examination on the 10th Feb. at the Town Hall, when it appeared that her ar- rest was caused by the captain of the Lau- ra. The girl refused to tell the magistrate, Alderman Bourne, her fathers name she said she could see no. necessity for it: she said she was a sailor now, and such inten- ded to remain. MT. Duflrey, of the Lau- ra, wished the Magistrate to place her in his charge, that he might restore her to her father.

It was in the year 251, B. 0. that elephants were first introduced into the cireus,' by Metellus, berg those recently mentioned as captured in Sicily From this period, (says our author,) the passion for public ex- hibitions and combats of wild beasts, spread not only in Italy, but throughout the Roman empire in all the provinces\" Such was the general rage, that scarcely a. fixed military station was without its circus or amphithea-' tre of turf or timber.\n\n The circular form of the amphitheatre was changed ny Julius Cesar for the elliptical, and thereafter such buildings were called theatres for hunting. They were also used for the combats of gladiators, as their acccommoda- tions were so much better than the circular buidings.-They were still however called circus, as often as by other names. Some were little more than notvral Ualleys, with benches cut in the surrounding hills others were elliptical excavations, with benches of turf like that near Sandwich in Kent; some were partly excavated, and partly construc- ted with masonry, like the amphitheatre at Caerlon in Britain. There were also amphi- theatres constructed to hold water for the combat of aquatic and amphibious animals. When these buildings were of timber, they were erected orremOved as occasion required. CapiOdorus states that Vespasian spent as much on one as would have built capital ci- ty; and Martial relates that Roman citizens crowded from all parts of the empire td be present at these exhibitions. .l\n\n The amphithcatres were supplied with wild beasts from the remotest provinces Of the ena- plre, and with :he most rare and singular ais- imals. without regard to their size or ferociots nature. Lions, tigers, bears. and hyenas, were brought, in what appears almost incredible numbers; the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopo- tamus. and camelOpard; stags and deer of every description; zebras, wild asses. ostrich and even the crocodile of the Nile, were all produced at different times & in various nnnn- bers to be exhibited IS objects of curiosity. to be hunted by the people in the theatre. or slaughtered in the combat with each other.\n\n The diversions were of three kinds In the first the anfphitheatre was cOnserted into a lrnslrespDtatiOn cf a natural f0fNsf hv 9neMuN Of",
