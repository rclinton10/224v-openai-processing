Ag. xviii are UNI\nversallv admitted, wherey er they have been at\ntentively compared with carriages OF any other\ndescription. A horse when lie acts sngy, viii\ndo half as much more work as when he acts III\nconjunction with another; that is TO say that two\nhorses will separately do as much work as three\nconjunctively; this arises, in the first place from\nthe single horse being so near the load he draws\nand in the next place, from the point or line OF\ndraught being so much below his breast, il being\nusual to make the wheels of single horse carts\nlow. A horse harnessed sngly has nothing but\nhis load TO contend with, whereas, when he\ndraws in conjunction with another, he is gencr\nally embarrassed By some difference OF rate, the\nh orse behind or before him, moving quicker or\nslower than himself; he is likewise frequently in\nconvenienced by the greater or less height OF\nhis neighbor: these considerations give decd\ned advantage to the single horse cart. The very\ngreat ease with which low cart is filled may be\nadded, as man may load it, with the help OF\nlong handled shovel or fork, By means Of his\nhands only; whereas in order to fill higher cart,\nnot only the mans back, but his arms and whole\nperson must be excrted To the use OF single\nhorses in draught, there can be no objection,\nunless it be the supposed necessity OF additional\ndrivers created by it; the fact however, is that II\nhas no such effect, for horses once in the habit\nof going singly will follow each other as uniform\nly and as steadily as they do when harnessed TO-\ngether; and accordingly we sceon the most ire\nauented roads in Ireland, men conducting three\nfour or FIVE single horse carts each, without any\ninconvenience to the passengers such, likewise,\nis the case where lime and coil are generally\ncarried upon pack-horscs. In some of the north\nen counties Of Berlin also, one Hlan manages\ntwo or three, and sometimes more, one-horsc\ncarts.\n\n\nMr. Arthur Young, in the 18th volume Of his\nAnnals Of Agriculture, states the following di-\nutnsions Of single horse cart, which he BY the\ntest Of experience, has found 70 be the most al\nvantageous.\n\n\nBuck-Length, feet inch,\n\n\nIreadth---3 feet Z inches,\n\n\nDepth--2 feet.\n\n\nCubical fect---55 and afraction.\n\n\nOn his farm of $50 acres, hlr. Young employ\ned 5 such CARTS and obs rived that he would not\nadd more than one 10 the number\n\n\nDR.. Mease, in wiillch's Domestic ncyclope-\ndia, Philadelphia Edition, says \"a prediction\nhas long prevailed in England and America, N\nfavor of large teams and wagons, IN regard 70\nwhich, says DR.. Anderson, the gr at object Of\n\n\n\n\n\nload of goods NAV be transported in one carriage\nwithout regard to any other circumstance But\nths is acting in direct opposition to the best es\ntablished principles of mechanics, OF economy\nand of common sense \"1he parts OF large me\nchanics must be made so proportio ably thick,\nbecause of the lergcnass of the size on which\nthey are constructed, that the very weight Of the\nmachine itself is load which not only subjects\nthe owner to great and unnecessary expense\nin the purchase, but what is worse, obl5es him\nto be at a great expense for horses to drag that\nunnecessary load from place to place When\nfour or more horses are yoked 10 team. three\nOf these horses must draw horizontally, and con-\nseduently in manner inconsistent with their\nmechanism.\n\n\n\"The immensely large wheels Of wagons, also\nadd exceedingly to the draught OF the horses,\nbecause wagon from the slowness Of its motion,\nobliges the horses to overcome its us merttp ev-\ncry moment they are drawing II. That is, it is\nthe same thing as putting it into state OF mo\nton from state of rest every moment\n\n\n\"The very great weight Of our western coin-\ntry wagons is well known Let any one then\nreflect upon the great portion Of the horses'\nstrength which is spent in drawing the wagon,\nbesides the load which it contains and which\nought to be applied to support an increase Of the\nLatter Why should not each horse draw his\nown cartf There can be no doubt that four\nhorses with each properly constructed cart\nwill draw more and with more ease to themselves,\nthan when they are roked to ono wagon.\n\n\n\"A good horse will draw common load 5\ncwt of goods, and travel farther in day than\nour wagons, and over worse roads, whereas 10\nOF II cwt Of burthen is as much fall the\nshare OF one wagon horse, his superior strength\nbeing wasted on a cumhrous wheel\n\n\n\"fhe rough roads beyond the mountains NAV\nprobably prevent the adoption of the plan Of one\nhorse carts, but why could not each horse draw\nms own cart, from the farms in Lancaster county\n\n\n\"'The halter of one horse might be tied to the\ncart which goes before it, and BY this means one\ndriver would have the whole as much at com\nmand as if they were yoked in the chains Of .\nwagon A horse has also the momentum Of hi.\ndraught increased by having portion of the\nweight upon his back The expense Of turn\npike may be increased by the carts, but wouls\nnot the increased freight more than make up .\n\n\nDickson on Agriculture says in substance, thu\ngreat superiority Of one horse carts is rendere,\nvery striking by the fact that two horses witt\nsingle horse carts will draw much as thre\nhorses with one cart. A common carrier at Carl\nUse who many years employeda wagon, has lii\nit aside, and now uses single horse carts only q\nhe finds he can, by these means carry muc\ngreater weights.\n\n\nWe think the fore going observations may SUI\ngest some useful hints to all who have occasic\nto use wagons or carts. But there are circut\nstances and cases to which single horse carts\nwagons are not so we'll adapted as the commc",

            "article": "forms and modes OF construction, acGorathS 10\nthe nature and situation OF the roads, and many\nlocal circumstances; but for the purposes of\nfarming, those Of the single horse kind, are in\ngeneral, the most advantageous and useinl,-\nThe advantage Of single horse carts, Lord X\nSeymour observes, Ann. Ag. xviii are UNI\nversallv admitted, wherey er they have been at\ntentively compared with carriages OF any other\ndescription. A horse when lie acts sngy, viii\ndo half as much more work as when he acts III\nconjunction with another; that is TO say that two\nhorses will separately do as much work as three\nconjunctively; this arises, in the first place from\nthe single horse being so near the load he draws\nand in the next place, from the point or line OF\ndraught being so much below his breast, il being\nusual to make the wheels of single horse carts\nlow. A horse harnessed sngly has nothing but\nhis load TO contend with, whereas, when he\ndraws in conjunction with another, he is gencr\nally embarrassed By some difference OF rate, the\nh orse behind or before him, moving quicker or\nslower than himself; he is likewise frequently in\nconvenienced by the greater or less height OF\nhis neighbor: these considerations give decd\ned advantage to the single horse cart. The very\ngreat ease with which low cart is filled may be\nadded, as man may load it, with the help OF\nlong handled shovel or fork, By means Of his\nhands only; whereas in order to fill higher cart,\nnot only the mans back, but his arms and whole\nperson must be excrted To the use OF single\nhorses in draught, there can be no objection,\nunless it be the supposed necessity OF additional\ndrivers created by it; the fact however, is that II\nhas no such effect, for horses once in the habit\nof going singly will follow each other as uniform\nly and as steadily as they do when harnessed TO-\ngether; and accordingly we sceon the most ire\nauented roads in Ireland, men conducting three\nfour or FIVE single horse carts each, without any\ninconvenience to the passengers such, likewise,\nis the case where lime and coil are generally\ncarried upon pack-horscs. In some of the north\nen counties Of Berlin also, one Hlan manages\ntwo or three, and sometimes more, one-horsc\ncarts.\n\n\nMr. Arthur Young, in the 18th volume Of his\nAnnals Of Agriculture, states the following di-\nutnsions Of single horse cart, which he BY the\ntest Of experience, has found 70 be the most al\nvantageous.\n\n\nBuck-Length, feet inch,\n\n\nIreadth---3 feet Z inches,\n\n\nDepth--2 feet.\n\n\nCubical fect---55 and afraction.\n\n\nOn his farm of $50 acres, hlr. Young employ\ned 5 such CARTS and obs rived that he would not\nadd more than one 10 the number\n\n\nDR.. Mease, in wiillch's Domestic ncyclope-\ndia, Philadelphia Edition, says \"a prediction\nhas long prevailed in England and America, N\nfavor of large teams and wagons, IN regard 70\nwhich, says DR.. Anderson, the gr at object Of\n\n\n\n\n\nload of goods NAV be transported in one carriage\nwithout regard to any other circumstance But\nths is acting in direct opposition to the best es\ntablished principles of mechanics, OF economy\nand of common sense \"1he parts OF large me\nchanics must be made so proportio ably thick,\nbecause of the lergcnass of the size on which\nthey are constructed, that the very weight Of the\nmachine itself is load which not only subjects\nthe owner to great and unnecessary expense\nin the purchase, but what is worse, obl5es him\nto be at a great expense for horses to drag that\nunnecessary load from place to place When\nfour or more horses are yoked 10 team. three\nOf these horses must draw horizontally, and con-\nseduently in manner inconsistent with their\nmechanism.\n\n\n\"The immensely large wheels Of wagons, also\nadd exceedingly to the draught OF the horses,\nbecause wagon from the slowness Of its motion,\nobliges the horses to overcome its us merttp ev-\ncry moment they are drawing II. That is, it is\nthe same thing as putting it into state OF mo\nton from state of rest every moment\n\n\n\"The very great weight Of our western coin-\ntry wagons is well known Let any one then\nreflect upon the great portion Of the horses'\nstrength which is spent in drawing the wagon,\nbesides the load which it contains and which\nought to be applied to support an increase Of the\nLatter Why should not each horse draw his\nown cartf There can be no doubt that four\nhorses with each properly constructed cart\nwill draw more and with more ease to themselves,\nthan when they are roked to ono wagon.\n\n\n\"A good horse will draw common load 5\ncwt of goods, and travel farther in day than\nour wagons, and over worse roads, whereas 10\nOF II cwt Of burthen is as much fall the\nshare OF one wagon horse, his superior strength\nbeing wasted on a cumhrous wheel\n\n\n\"fhe rough roads beyond the mountains NAV\nprobably prevent the adoption of the plan Of one\nhorse carts, but why could not each horse draw\nms own cart, from the farms in Lancaster county\n\n\n\"'The halter of one horse might be tied to the\ncart which goes before it, and BY this means one\ndriver would have the whole as much at com\nmand as if they were yoked in the chains Of .\nwagon A horse has also the momentum Of hi.\ndraught increased by having portion of the\nweight upon his back The expense Of turn\npike may be increased by the carts, but wouls\nnot the increased freight more than make up .\n\n\nDickson on Agriculture says in substance, thu\ngreat superiority Of one horse carts is rendere,\nvery striking by the fact that two horses witt\nsingle horse carts will draw much as thre\nhorses with one cart. A common carrier at Carl\nUse who many years employeda wagon, has lii\nit aside, and now uses single horse carts only q\nhe finds he can, by these means carry muc\ngreater weights.\n\n\nWe think the fore going observations may SUI\ngest some useful hints to all who have occasic\nto use wagons or carts. But there are circut\nstances and cases to which single horse carts\nwagons are not so we'll adapted as the commc",
