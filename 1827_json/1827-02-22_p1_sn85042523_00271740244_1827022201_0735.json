The\nshadows of approaching night were already\nfast changing the green mantle of the thick\nforest to one of funeral gloom, and the start\nling screeeh Of the grey owl fell at inter\nwalls on the ear of watchtul anxiety.\n\n\nAt the cottage all was silent-hope and\nfear alternately lighted or shaded each\nchanging brow--as the distant echoes seem\ned to come laden with the tramp of horse\nmen, or the cool dew of evening fell silent\non the diving breeze.
