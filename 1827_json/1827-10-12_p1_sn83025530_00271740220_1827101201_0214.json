After returning home, he visited\nEngland, Joined the British navy, obtained post in\nCooks last expedition, with which he continued\nmore than four years, till it arrived again in Eng\nland. He was in the skirmish in which Cook lost\nhis life, at the Sandwich Islands, and was near the\ngreat navigator when he fell. At the close of the\nAmerican war he came back to this country, having\nbeen absent eight yenrs, and ~as the first to pro-\npose voyage to the Northwest coast In concert\nwith Robert Morris, he planned such voyage, but\nafter year spent in unsuccessful attempt to pro-\ncure vessel and fit it out, the project failed With\nletters from Mr.. Morris and other gentlemen he\nhastened to Europe intending there 10 make an ef\nfort TO accomplish his wish. For this purpose he\nvisited Spain and France, and more than two years\npassed away in negotiations with mercantile compae\nnes and individuals, but without success. He was\n\n\nintimate with Jefferson lat that time minister in\nParis, with Lafayette, and with Paul Jones, who\nencouraged and aided him.\n\n\nAfter encountering numerous difficulties, and not\nsucceeding in his project of voyage to the North\nwest coast, he formed the design Of going by land\nfrom Paris to Behring'S Straits, thence crossing\nthe American continent, and proceeding homeward\nover the Rocky Mountains, with determination to\nexplore those unknown regions Through the in\ntercesson ofthe Russian minister and Baron Grimm,\npermission was granted by the Empress Of Russia\nfor him to pass through her dominons. In London\nhe was patronized by Sir Joseph Banks and other\ngentlemen of eminence. He went over to Ham-\nburgh, thence to Copenhagen, Stockholm, and\naround the Gulf of Bothna in the midst ofwinter to\nST. Petersburg. He arrived there when the En-\npress was on her famous tour to the Crmea, but by\nthe aid of Count Segur and Professor Pallas he OBJ\ntanned passport from the proper minister and set\noff for Siberia. 1t was so late in the season before\nbe reached the borders of Kamtscbatka, that the\ngovernor of Yakutsk would not suffer him to proceed\nfurther till the opening of spring Meantime the\nempress became suspicious of his designs, and sent\ntwo Russian soldiers after him, who brought him\nback in the winter to the confines of Poland, dis\ntance of more than six thousand miles, where they\nleft him in poverty and wretchedness. He found\nhis way to London and was again kindly received\nby Sir Joseph Banks and his other friends. The\nAssociation for Promoting Travels in Africa was\njust at that time instituted. Being defeated in all\nhis attempts to explore his own country, Ledyard\neagerly grasped at the proposal to engage under the\nauspices of this society. He spent few days in\nParis, and then proceeded to Marsailes, whence he\nsailed for Alexandria in Egypt. At Grand Cairo he\npassed several weeks in gaining acquaintance\nwith the language and habits of the people, who\ntravelled in the caravans, and had made agree\nment 10 accompany one ofthese to the interior, when\nhe was suddenly taken i'll, and +ded in January,\n1890, being the hrstyictim in the cause of African\ndiscovery, to which many have since become\nmartyrs.\n\n\nHis Siberian Journal has been preserved entire,\nand several letters written from Russia 10 Mr.. JEFF\nferson and other persons. His celebrated eulogy\non women often repeated and so beautifully YER\nsifed by Mrs. Barbauld, was written at Yathutsk in\nSiberia. This journal, also, contains many Curl\nremarks on hecharacter and customs of the\nTartars, as compared with the American Indians\nand the South Sea Islanders, whom he had before\nseen in various parts Of the globe His Journals\nand letters while he was in France and Spain are",

After returning home, he visited\nEngland, Joined the British navy, obtained post in\nCooks last expedition, with which he continued\nmore than four years, till it arrived again in Eng\nland. He was in the skirmish in which Cook lost\nhis life, at the Sandwich Islands, and was near the\ngreat navigator when he fell. At the close of the\nAmerican war he came back to this country, having\nbeen absent eight yenrs, and ~as the first to pro-\npose voyage to the Northwest coast In concert\nwith Robert Morris, he planned such voyage, but\nafter year spent in unsuccessful attempt to pro-\ncure vessel and fit it out, the project failed With\nletters from Mr.. Morris and other gentlemen he\nhastened to Europe intending there 10 make an ef\nfort TO accomplish his wish. For this purpose he\nvisited Spain and France, and more than two years\npassed away in negotiations with mercantile compae\nnes and individuals, but without success. He was\n\n\nintimate with Jefferson lat that time minister in\nParis, with Lafayette, and with Paul Jones, who\nencouraged and aided him.\n\n\nAfter encountering numerous difficulties, and not\nsucceeding in his project of voyage to the North\nwest coast, he formed the design Of going by land\nfrom Paris to Behring'S Straits, thence crossing\nthe American continent, and proceeding homeward\nover the Rocky Mountains, with determination to\nexplore those unknown regions Through the in\ntercesson ofthe Russian minister and Baron Grimm,\npermission was granted by the Empress Of Russia\nfor him to pass through her dominons. In London\nhe was patronized by Sir Joseph Banks and other\ngentlemen of eminence. He went over to Ham-\nburgh, thence to Copenhagen, Stockholm, and\naround the Gulf of Bothna in the midst ofwinter to\nST. Petersburg. He arrived there when the En-\npress was on her famous tour to the Crmea, but by\nthe aid of Count Segur and Professor Pallas he OBJ\ntanned passport from the proper minister and set\noff for Siberia. 1t was so late in the season before\nbe reached the borders of Kamtscbatka, that the\ngovernor of Yakutsk would not suffer him to proceed\nfurther till the opening of spring Meantime the\nempress became suspicious of his designs, and sent\ntwo Russian soldiers after him, who brought him\nback in the winter to the confines of Poland, dis\ntance of more than six thousand miles, where they\nleft him in poverty and wretchedness. He found\nhis way to London and was again kindly received\nby Sir Joseph Banks and his other friends. The\nAssociation for Promoting Travels in Africa was\njust at that time instituted. Being defeated in all\nhis attempts to explore his own country, Ledyard\neagerly grasped at the proposal to engage under the\nauspices of this society. He spent few days in\nParis, and then proceeded to Marsailes, whence he\nsailed for Alexandria in Egypt. At Grand Cairo he\npassed several weeks in gaining acquaintance\nwith the language and habits of the people, who\ntravelled in the caravans, and had made agree\nment 10 accompany one ofthese to the interior, when\nhe was suddenly taken i'll, and +ded in January,\n1890, being the hrstyictim in the cause of African\ndiscovery, to which many have since become\nmartyrs.\n\n\nHis Siberian Journal has been preserved entire,\nand several letters written from Russia 10 Mr..
