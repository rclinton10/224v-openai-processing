Still they thought themselves respectable some of them were wealthy, and ranked high in civ il and military life.

It would evince a sad departure from those principles which guided our pilgrim fathers across the Atlantic, and which for two centuries adorned the characters, and guided the actions of our pious ancestors, if argu- ments must be used to induce parents to place their children under the influence of Sabbath School instruction. If it be necessary that children be instructed in those principles which pertain to civil society, is it not also important that they be instructed in those duties which belong to thGm as citizens of christian land, and aS ProbatEOners for eternity If the sane tifcation of the Sabbath be the bulwark of of tie Christian religion, is it not of vast i'm portance that children should be taught to Remember the Sabbath day to keep it hoIy!\" And if children are not thus taught, when eff 6cient means for their instruction are neglec- ted, is it not the duty of every christian and every philanthropist, to unite as the heart of one man, to devise means, and to render them effectuaD, for the Christian education of the rising generation? Sabbath Schools, with us, do not languish for want of nominal support-' CTS, and professed friends; they languish only from the carslessness of parents in enforcing upon their children faithful attendance upon these means of instruction. While almost every parent is ready to acknowledge the util- ity of these nurseries of piety, and to express a warm desire that they may be well support ed, they do not appear to feel the importance ofpersonally engaging in the cause, by exert ing parental influence and authority in its favor over their children. They wish their children might attend the school, and receive benefit therefrom, but they do not universally feel it a duty to see to it that their children previously prepare themselves, by study, for a profitable attendance; or even to enforce upon them any attention to the sacred hours of the school. Itis impossible that the young should derive that advantage from the School which ifs tendency has to inpart unless parents lend it something more than cold, heartless appreciation. Parents must feel deep inter- est in the subject, and they must impart this interest to their children, and then the labors of the instructors will not be in vain-then children will not fear the taunts and sneers of their thoughtless and wicked companions :- ifthey can feel and say that {\" my father and my mother are friends ofthe Sabbath School\" they are strengthened against all the ridcule of its opponents. This subject is so interesting that too much cannot he said in its favor, al- though enough has already been said, we trust, to induce our readers to manifest by their conduct that they feel deep interest in the prosperity ofSabbath Schools.\n\n We are requested to mention that the Schools in the Congregational and Episcopal Societies in this village, will commence the next Sabbath and it is confidently hoped that both schools will be fully attended by all those who wish to improve the advantages thus held out for religious instruction.\n\n There is so much good sense in the following article from the National IntelIigencer, tsat we cannot help copying it into our columns. Once the contention between Republicans and FederaIists was about measures and then there was some ground for contention; now, with the choice few who raise the cry of federalism against every one who does not support their personal interests, as though that name would fix stigma which will insure an over throw, can only say federal without showing one reason why federal is not as good as re- publican. Ask then,-Is he not a friend to our republican insttutions-does he not faith fully support the national and state constitu- tion! \"Yes.-but he's Jsderalist.\" Is he not an honest, capable man,. the friend of peace, of defensive measures, naval and military, of internal improvement, of the diffusion of in- tellectua: light, of economy and strict accoun- liability in the public expenditures\" and the answer is, Oh yes-but then he's tederalist And by the way, among our modern ssate re- PuotIeGns, the name federal is not applied to those individuals alone, who once cOntended for the ascendancy of the name; it is applied Az III NN..aN 4s",

Men are apt to value little that which costs them little. If direct tax of one or two cents on the dol lar were assessed f9r the support of common schoosr those wh3 pay this tax would feel an increased interest in having the money thus raised employed in the best possible manner. In Massachusetts, where school instructors are paid out of he town treasury, in the same way that other town expenses are paid, the most lively intersst is generally felt in the suc- cess ot'their schools, and in the ability of their instructors andsfrom all the evidence we have upon theIspbject,we are led to believe that common schools in that state stand upon more elevated ground than they do with us.-We are not alone, and. unsupported in the asser- tiQ6 the eeils which have grown out of this long neglect of common schools, are felt ] throughout the state, and spirit of enquiry\n\n intR the last means.for elevating the standard\n\n of common school instruction has been exci- ted which promises much good to he rising generation.

Such objects are wor- thy the attention and efforts of every philan- thropist and christian; and we trust that Litchfeld County will take an active part in the business; and that her influence will be felt upon this important subject.-It has been suggested that meeting should be held in this county previous to the session of the Le- gislature, and that the subject should be can didly discussed and acted upon and if any thing can be done to better our schools, that steps should be taken to ensure the success of such treasures as are thought best calculated for the object. Certainly when any measures are in operation for the benefit of our chi- dren and youth, the hearts of all intelligent parents must heat in unison upon the subject; it is a common interest; an interest in which parents, guardians, and masters, are propor- tionably concerned; to preserve our schools from any further decIension; or to enable them to keep pace with the improvements of I",

Still they thought themselves respectable some of them were wealthy, and ranked high in civ il and military life. The writer lately had occasion to visit the same place, and now calls upon us to listen to the following mel ancholy results of this course, produced in 10 years. \"Onc has been several times in prison, for crimes committed while intoxi- cated; and is now miserable, wandering vagabond without money and without friends another is pauper, loathsome being who is never sober when he can obtain stimulants of sufficient strength to drown his faculties; and the other eight have died drunkards, at an average age of 40 years.

It would evince a sad departure from those principles which guided our pilgrim fathers across the Atlantic, and which for two centuries adorned the characters, and guided the actions of our pious ancestors, if argu- ments must be used to induce parents to place their children under the influence of Sabbath School instruction. If it be necessary that children be instructed in those principles which pertain to civil society, is it not also important that they be instructed in those duties which belong to thGm as citizens of christian land, and aS ProbatEOners for eternity If the sane tifcation of the Sabbath be the bulwark of of tie Christian religion, is it not of vast i'm portance that children should be taught to Remember the Sabbath day to keep it hoIy!\" And if children are not thus taught, when eff 6cient means for their instruction are neglec- ted, is it not the duty of every christian and every philanthropist, to unite as the heart of one man, to devise means, and to render them effectuaD, for the Christian education of the rising generation? Sabbath Schools, with us, do not languish for want of nominal support-' CTS, and professed friends; they languish only from the carslessness of parents in enforcing upon their children faithful attendance upon these means of instruction. While almost every parent is ready to acknowledge the util- ity of these nurseries of piety, and to express a warm desire that they may be well support ed, they do not appear to feel the importance ofpersonally engaging in the cause, by exert ing parental influence and authority in its favor over their children. They wish their children might attend the school, and receive benefit therefrom, but they do not universally feel it a duty to see to it that their children previously prepare themselves, by study, for a profitable attendance; or even to enforce upon them any attention to the sacred hours of the school. Itis impossible that the young should derive that advantage from the School which ifs tendency has to inpart unless parents lend it something more than cold, heartless appreciation. Parents must feel deep inter- est in the subject, and they must impart this interest to their children, and then the labors of the instructors will not be in vain-then children will not fear the taunts and sneers of their thoughtless and wicked companions :- ifthey can feel and say that {\" my father and my mother are friends ofthe Sabbath School\" they are strengthened against all the ridcule of its opponents. This subject is so interesting that too much cannot he said in its favor, al- though enough has already been said, we trust, to induce our readers to manifest by their conduct that they feel deep interest in the prosperity ofSabbath Schools.\n\n We are requested to mention that the Schools in the Congregational and Episcopal Societies in this village, will commence the next Sabbath and it is confidently hoped that both schools will be fully attended by all those who wish to improve the advantages thus held out for religious instruction.\n\n There is so much good sense in the following article from the National IntelIigencer, tsat we cannot help copying it into our columns. Once the contention between Republicans and FederaIists was about measures and then there was some ground for contention; now, with the choice few who raise the cry of federalism against every one who does not support their personal interests, as though that name would fix stigma which will insure an over throw, can only say federal without showing one reason why federal is not as good as re- publican. Ask then,-Is he not a friend to our republican insttutions-does he not faith fully support the national and state constitu- tion! \"Yes.-but he's Jsderalist.\" Is he not an honest, capable man,. the friend of peace, of defensive measures, naval and military, of internal improvement, of the diffusion of in- tellectua: light, of economy and strict accoun- liability in the public expenditures\" and the answer is, Oh yes-but then he's tederalist And by the way, among our modern ssate re- PuotIeGns, the name federal is not applied to those individuals alone, who once cOntended for the ascendancy of the name; it is applied Az III NN..aN 4s",

Such objects are wor- thy the attention and efforts of every philan- thropist and christian; and we trust that Litchfeld County will take an active part in the business; and that her influence will be felt upon this important subject.-It has been suggested that meeting should be held in this county previous to the session of the Le- gislature, and that the subject should be can didly discussed and acted upon and if any thing can be done to better our schools, that steps should be taken to ensure the success of such treasures as are thought best calculated for the object. Certainly when any measures are in operation for the benefit of our chi- dren and youth, the hearts of all intelligent parents must heat in unison upon the subject; it is a common interest; an interest in which parents, guardians, and masters, are propor- tionably concerned; to preserve our schools from any further decIension; or to enable them to keep pace with the improvements of I",
