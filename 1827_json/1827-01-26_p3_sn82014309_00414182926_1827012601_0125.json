Merwin have the delicacy to give this pledge personality Were any of the members of our last State caucus also mem- bers of that caucus that displaced MT. Ster- ling-and did it so happen that this pledge had been given them Did any of them at the last caucus vote for MT. Merwin, or did they consider MT. Merwin and his friends as playing a double game? Does Mir. Merwin and his friends wish to create scism and discord in the party to which he and they profess to belong? Does Mir.

Merwin. And also, as profess to pre- serve strict neutrality between both these gentlemen, your correspondent may rest assured that when the investigation into Mir.

In the House, the battle is still carried on upon the subject of revolutionary compcnsations. MT. Webstergave yesterday one of his powerful speeches on this subject. To-day MT. Wicklife took the floor at an early hour, and advanced an argument simi- lar to that which noticed in my last, with considerable vehemence. He was followed by MT. Test, of I, d. who spoke at great length against the bill. He condemned it as partial in its allotment Ofthe recommendations which it contemplated, and as giving to the officers a greater proportion of the sum than theywere entitled to. He thought that the country were equally indebted to the militia as to the regulars, and to the privates as to the officers; but he would not allow that the United States owed debt to these men. If it was debt ofgrattude that was meant, then it was true the debt was boundIess. But the men of the revolution fought for glory, forindependence, and not for mercenary reward. If it was in those who served, he should be in favour of\n\n \n\n ward all according to their merits, he thought the distribution of what we could give should be equally dispensed to all. Besides, he com pIained that the bill did not discriminate as to the condition of the officers There might be some aboundinG in wealth-and to them he would not give but show him a poor officer of the revolution, and as far as his influence went, that man should be shielded from want during the remainder ofhis days. MT Clark, of Ky. next took the floor. He argued upon the point, that the heirs of the deceased revo- lutiOnary soldiers were also entitled to the compensation, as well as the survivors, and urged his ideas with very strong statements and deductions. Still must object to this course of reasoning: because, if it prevails,by throwing a mountain of expenditures in the way, it will defeat the object of the bill. MT. Sprague of Me. followed in nearly the same strain; but no question was taken before ad- jOurnment.\n\n attended the annual meeting of the Colo nization Society, this morning. The meeting was thin, but great number of members of Congress, in proportion to the whole. were present. Mir. Clay was among the audience; but on the account of the absence of many of the members, occasiOned by the failure of notification, after the Report had been read, the meeting was postponed to Saturday next.\n\n Not one word, as yet, from MT. Calhoun's Committee. You may have seen communi- cation in the Journal, signed \" Young Rife.\" which was doubtless written by Satterlee Clark, as he is the person, who, as is there in- sinuated, was bullied, in order to bring him to the ultimatum of duel. The bully is said to be gallant Colonel. elevated by Mir. Calhoun to an office in the Department of War.\n\n There is much solid business now upon the hands of both houses of Congress. Thus far, contrary to anticipation, little has been done in public affairs; but a much greater number than usual of private matters have been des- patched.\n\n Mr Msllary OfVtgave notice that he should on \"Wednesday next, ask the House to go into Committee of the Whole on the hill proposing",

Weems, Everett and Living ston, spoke at considerable length against the amendment, which was finally agreed to-ayes 1O1, nose 88. The house then adjourned. Tuesday, Jan. 16. After the reception of several reports | from the different committees, The house resumed the bill to provide for the surviving officers of the army of the revolution.\n\n MT. Whittlesey said he had voted with the Majority yesterday, and he was now requested to move for reconsideration of the vote by which the amendment of the gentlemen from Kentucky had been adop- ted. It was due to himself, however to state, that he should still vote for the a. mendment, from the conviction, that if a debt was due to the officers of the revolu- ton, it was equally due to the heirs and representatives of those who had died. He then moved that the house do reconsider it's vote of yesterday.\n\n On motion of MT. Wright, the ayes and noes were ordered on this question; and there appeared, ayes 7S, noes 96. So the question was determined in the negative.\n\n MT. Woods then moved to lay the bill on the table.\n\n On motion of MT. Burges, the ayes and noes were ordered-and the question being taken, there were, ayes 76, noes 1O9; so the motion was negatived. The question being then on concurring with the committee of the whole in its a. mendment,\n\n MT. Burgess rose for the purpose of mo- wing that the house go into committee of the whole in order to increase the appropri- ation, for if the amendment of the gentle man from Kentucky was adopted, the pitt tance for each individual would be so small as to render the bill entirely useless.\n\n The division of the question was called for.\n\n The question being on the committed of the bill, MT. Buchanan arose, and after other remark said he had risen to ask, if, after going into committee of the whole, it would be competent to move to amend the bill by striking out the amendment of the gentleman from Kentucky. If SO, on the principle that while there is life, there is hope, he would vote in favor of going into committee.\n\n The Speaker decided that it would be",

The weather was excessively cold (the thermometer at 13)-it ragged for five hours, famed by brisk northwest wind; and, at last, was subdued after destroying about forty houses, besides back-buildings, and other property, in the whole valued at $2OO,OOO. It is thought that thou sand persons from Washington-with the marine corps and persons attached to the navy yard, proceeded with their appara tus, the whole at an average distance of seven miles, to assist in subduing the de. vouring element and it appears that the apparatus they took with them chiefly af- forded the means of arresting the prog ress of the flames. The efficiency of shin- gle roofs to spread a fire, and of hose to prevent its spreading, is said to have been r clearly demonstrated on this awful occa- sion.-NileS.\n\n We are pleased to learn from the south- ern papers that the legislature of Virginia, mindful of the character of the state, and of the Senate of the U. s. has refused to re-elect John Randolph to the station he so foully disgraced last winter.

In the House, the battle is still carried on upon the subject of revolutionary compcnsations. MT. Webstergave yesterday one of his powerful speeches on this subject. To-day MT. Wicklife took the floor at an early hour, and advanced an argument simi- lar to that which noticed in my last, with considerable vehemence. He was followed by MT. Test, of I, d. who spoke at great length against the bill. He condemned it as partial in its allotment Ofthe recommendations which it contemplated, and as giving to the officers a greater proportion of the sum than theywere entitled to. He thought that the country were equally indebted to the militia as to the regulars, and to the privates as to the officers; but he would not allow that the United States owed debt to these men. If it was debt ofgrattude that was meant, then it was true the debt was boundIess. But the men of the revolution fought for glory, forindependence, and not for mercenary reward. If it was in those who served, he should be in favour of\n\n \n\n ward all according to their merits, he thought the distribution of what we could give should be equally dispensed to all. Besides, he com pIained that the bill did not discriminate as to the condition of the officers There might be some aboundinG in wealth-and to them he would not give but show him a poor officer of the revolution, and as far as his influence went, that man should be shielded from want during the remainder ofhis days. MT Clark, of Ky. next took the floor. He argued upon the point, that the heirs of the deceased revo- lutiOnary soldiers were also entitled to the compensation, as well as the survivors, and urged his ideas with very strong statements and deductions. Still must object to this course of reasoning: because, if it prevails,by throwing a mountain of expenditures in the way, it will defeat the object of the bill. MT. Sprague of Me. followed in nearly the same strain; but no question was taken before ad- jOurnment.\n\n attended the annual meeting of the Colo nization Society, this morning. The meeting was thin, but great number of members of Congress, in proportion to the whole. were present. Mir. Clay was among the audience; but on the account of the absence of many of the members, occasiOned by the failure of notification, after the Report had been read, the meeting was postponed to Saturday next.\n\n Not one word, as yet, from MT. Calhoun's Committee. You may have seen communi- cation in the Journal, signed \" Young Rife.\" which was doubtless written by Satterlee Clark, as he is the person, who, as is there in- sinuated, was bullied, in order to bring him to the ultimatum of duel. The bully is said to be gallant Colonel. elevated by Mir. Calhoun to an office in the Department of War.\n\n There is much solid business now upon the hands of both houses of Congress. Thus far, contrary to anticipation, little has been done in public affairs; but a much greater number than usual of private matters have been des- patched.\n\n Mr Msllary OfVtgave notice that he should on \"Wednesday next, ask the House to go into Committee of the Whole on the hill proposing",

The Grand Scignior, at whose court. it appears, the most accomplished diplomatists of Europe are at present assembled, began on the QQd, and up to the 26th, when the Maltese vessel sailed, he had put to death, or rather legitim- ateIy executed, upwards of 5000 of his sub jects.

It is thought that thou sand persons from Washington-with the marine corps and persons attached to the navy yard, proceeded with their appara tus, the whole at an average distance of seven miles, to assist in subduing the de. vouring element and it appears that the apparatus they took with them chiefly af- forded the means of arresting the prog ress of the flames.
