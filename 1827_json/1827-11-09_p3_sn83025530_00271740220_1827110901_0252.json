The Governor was 6 au-\nhorised to supply by militia drafts or by volunteers\nany defcieacy which mig ght arise in the militia,\ncalled out for the usual three months service\n\n\nWe have just met with the following remarks\nfrom the Cincinnati Gazette, and offer them nsteaC\nofany further comments of our own.\nIn this order, Gov. Blount fixes six months as tht\nperiod of service. From whence did he derive au\n\n\nhority TO do this? The Committee say from the or\nder Of the War Department of January, 1914. Bu\nthe order gives the Governor no direction about tn\ntime of service. ltconides to him, simply the pow\ner to call the militia, for the legal time, withou\nspecific requisition from the department.\n\n\nThe law of April 1874 which is quoted and relie\nupon provides, that militia called into service, unde\nthe act ofl796, may, # IN heopinion Of the Presl\ndent the United States, the public interest requir\n\n\n1t, be detained in service six months. Were he dis\nposed to do so the President could not legally cone\n\n\nupon another the discretion, specially confded to hir\ndy tasp. 1t was to his opinion alone, that the lay\nr submitted the decision and the opinion of anothe\n. could not be substituted. Had the President express\n!. y authorised Gov Blunt to decide upon the propr\nETY. of making call for six months, it would hay\n. been void and nugatory act He might as well hay",

These consist, first\nof all, in the profits of the exclusive trade with Chi\nna which notwithstanding that trade is conducted in\nthe most eXtravagant manner, must necessarily be-\nextremely productive TO the Company, from being\nthus entirely in their hands and from the circum-\nstance that Tea, the principal commodity brought\nfrom that country, is an article used by nearly eve\nry individual in Great Brtain.--lts price in Eng\nland, from this monopoly, is four times greater than\non the continent of Europe, or in America, or than\nit could be obtained for in England ifthe trade\nfree. second source of profit is the revenue\narising in India itself from two monopolies,-one of\nopium, the other Of salt on the first of which they\nmake profit of 700 or 800 per cent and on the\nsecond, Of $50 per cent. By the one they destroy\nthe health well the morals of the people, over\nChina and the Malay islands as to the second they\nforce its manufacture by the greatest cruetes exer\ncised on the natyes and then lay hisenormous tax\non the only condmen by which they can render pal\natable their miserable meal of boiled rice. The re-\nnaming revenue is from taxes justice, in the\nshape of stamps, and from tax on land.

But this\nthey never do. Though they cannot divide the\nenormous revenue among themselves, they Can spend\nil to enrich their relatives dependents and they\ncontinue to drain the country to the lowest ebb, re-\npaying the starving and oppressed natives by Civ\ning them the Trial by Jury The trade with India\nmot including that with China.) involves an immense\nannual loss their ships actually sailing at an expense\nOF EGO ton, while smaller traders perform the voy\nage at is ton.
