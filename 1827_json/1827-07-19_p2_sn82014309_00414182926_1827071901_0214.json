Clay's friends to\n\n some of mine, concerning the then pending\n\n presidential election, were answered freely\n\n and frankly at the time, hut without any cal\n\n culation that they were to be thrown into the\n\n public journals--But facts cannot be altered -and as your letter seems not to have been\n\n written for publication, can assure you, that having no concealment myself, nor any dread arising from what may have said on the oc- casion and subject alluded to, my feelings to- wards you are not in the least changed. I aL ways intended, should MT. Clay come out o. yer hi& own name and deny having any knowledge of the communication made by his frient to my friends and to me, that l would give him the name of gentleman through wE om that communication came. have not seeI your letter alluded to,as having been published in the Telegraph, although that paper, as I am informed, is regularly mailed for me at Washingt' n, still Irecieve 1t and that containing your letter has not yet come to hand, of course cannot say whether your statement is substantially correct or not--I will repeat, however, again the occurrence, ,afd to which my reply to you must have contormeG. aud from which, if there ..us i1een any varis tion, you can correct it. It is this. Early in January 1825,a mem Der of Congress of high N'spssctahiIity, visited me one morning, and observed, that he had communication he was des'rous 10 make to me-that he was informed there was a great intrigue going on; and that it was right that l should be informed of it-tlat he srame as friend-and let me receive the coLnmunica- ton as l might, the friendly motives through which it was made, he hoped would lTevent any change of friendship or feeling with re- gard to him. Towhich replied, from his high standing as a gentleman, and member of Congress, and from his uniform friendly, and gentlemanly conduct towards myself !",

The women and children were all unin- jured, excepting a little son Of Mrs. Plascut,\n\n who after the conflict was over. came to the captain, and with great c0Olness requested\n\n him to take ball out of his head. On ex-\n\n animation it appeared that ball had passed\n\n through the side of the boat, and had penetra-\n\n ted the Sorehead of this little her3, and re-\n\n mained under the skin. The captain took it l out, when the lad observed \"thot is not 0H,\"\n\n raised his arm, and exhibited piece of hone at the point of his elbow, which had been shot of and hung by the skin. His mother ex- claimed, \"why did you not tell me of this\" :\" |\" Because\" he coolly replied, |\" the captain directed us to he silent during the action, and l thought yOn would he likely to make noise if told you\"\n\n The party made the best Oftheir way down the river-the object was to reach Limestone that night. The captains arm had bled pro- fusely: he was compelled to close the sleeve of his coat in order to retain the blood and to check itS efusion. In this situation he was under the necessity for want of hands, to steer the boat with his left hand, until 10 O clock at night when he was relieved by Mir. Wm. Brooks, who resided near the river,and who was induced by the calls of the suffering party to come out to their assistance. By Mr. Brooks aid, and that of some others who were in the same manner brought to tLeir re- lief, they were enabled to land at. Limestone that night at about l2 o'clock.\n\n Immediately on the arrival of Mir. Brooks, Capt. Hubbell, relieved from labour and re- sponsibiIity sunk under the weight;of pain and fatigue; and for while became entirely in- sensible: When the boat reached Limestone he was unable to walk, and was obliged to be carried up to the tavern. Here he had his wounds dressed, where he continued until he acquired sufficient strength to proceed home ward. A\n\n On their arrival at Limestone. they found a considerable armed force, about tO march against the same Indians, from whose attacks they had so miraculously escaped and SO se- verely suffered. They now learned that on the proceeding Sunday, the same party of h. dians, had cut off detachment of men as- cending the Ohio from Fort Washington at the Mouth of Licking River, and; had killed with their tomahawks, without firing gun,s1 out of2g men of which the detachment con- sisted.\n\n Crowds ofreople as might be expected, came to examine the boat which had been the scene of so much heroistn and such horrid carnage, and to visit the resolute little band,by whom it had been so gallantly and perseveringly defended. On examination it was found that the sides of the boat were lit- orally filled with bullet holes. There was scarcely space of two feet square in the part ahove water, which had not either ball remaing in it or a hole through which one had passed. Some persons who had the curosi, ty to count the number of bullet holes in the blankets on the stern of the boat, affirmed that in the space of five feet sqrare,there were l22.-Four horses out of five were killed, ,and the escape of the fifth appeared almost mi raculOus.\n\n The day after the arrival of Capt. Hubbell and his companions, the five remaining boats which they had passed on the night preced- ing the attack, reached Limestone. Those. on board remarked, that during the action, they distinctly saw the flashes, but could not hear the reports of the guns. The Indians it appears had met with too formidable re- sistance from single boat to attack fleet, and suffered them to pass unmoIested: and since that time it is believed that no boat has been assailed on the Ohio.\n\n The force which marched out to disperse this formidable body of savages, discovered several dead Indians on the shore near the place of action. They also found the bodies of Capt. Greenhouse and of several others, who werein the boat. Most of them appear ed to have been whipped to death as they were stripped, tied to the trees. and marked with the appearance of lashes, and large rods which were evidently worn with use lying near them. .....-",

Clay had come out O. penly and avOwedly in favor of MT. Adams.\n\n It may be proper to observe that in the supposition that Mir Clay was not privy to the proposition stated, may have done injustice to him; if so, the gentleman informing me can explain.\n\n am, very respectfully. your most ohedi- ent servant, ANDREW JACKSON.\n\n MR. GARTER BEVERLEY.\n\n 1@ln relation to the preceding ,natter,the \" W heeling Gazette of the 30th ult. speak ing as if with \" authority\" says\n\n Wepublish in our papertofto- day copy of a letter from Gen. Jackson to Garter Bever- ley, Esq. who is now in this place, and re- ceived by him in reply to letter which he addressed to the general, requesting confr- nation of the statements which were first published in the Fayetteville Observer,in the form of an anonymous letter, of which Ms. Beverley is now the ayowed author. This letter from Gen. Jackson was, by permission of MT, Beverley, put into the hands of Mr. Clay, on his arrival in this town on the e1st inst. MT. Clay, in the presence of large number of gentlemen, declared in the most solemn and positive manner, that the state- ments contained in the letter 50 far as it con- cerned himself, had no foundation in truth, & 50 far as his knowldge authorized him to speak in behalf of his friends, he could pronounce it equally false and unfounded.\n\n To those, who are anxious to see this mat ter more fully developed, this letter from Gen. Jackson will be deemed valuable ac- quisition. The affair has assumed such a character, that it will admit of a thorough and ample investigation. An issue can now be made up, that will test the true merits of the case. MT. Clay has never shrunk from the most rigid scrutiny into his public character he now professes his readiness as well as his highest satisfaction at the opportunity which is afforded him to meet this reiterated and degrading attack upon his political honor and integrity. He will deem it a duty which he owes himself and to the public, to stand forth and vindicate his character from foul and odous charge, emanating as it does, from such distinguished parsonage as Gen. Jack son. The name of the hero's respectable in former must now be given up, and he must, come forward, and substantiate satisfactoral- ly, the truth of his statements. or be prepar- ed to take his station by the side of kindred accuser, who cried aloud and spared not, until the day of trial. The confidence of MT. Clay's friends in his political honesty, is not to be disturbed by vague and indefinite re- ports, even although Gen. Jackson himself propogates their circulation. He must offer something more than his own conjectures and suppositions to persuade them that Mr. Clay is an unprincipled & profigate politician: They will call for proofs-undeniable proof in the place of unauthorized infercnces and innu- endoes. So much gross and palpable misrep- resentation has been thrown upon the con- duct of MT. Clay, by his political enemies, it cannot be expected that any new charge will be received with ready credulity. He has been visited with a moisture of calumny and abuse which rarely falls to the lot of any man. His public and private character has been as- saulted in every shape which it was possible for political animosity to suggest. He has withstood the storm of the most violent and merciless persecution-frm and undaunted,",

My confidence, confess, is every day more and more staggered. His charac- ter bids fair to be made up altogether of ex- plantations, and when it is found necessary to have regular board who appear to be con- tinually in. session to sustain his character, it is more than ever believed character at all suitable for a President of the United States should require. It seems he has recently laid out some new work for these conservators of his good name. Not willing to trust his cause with others, he appears as witness in propria persOne. Like a zealOus advocate, finding the testimony squeeze a little too hard, lays by his official character and offers himself as witness, and after testifyiug awhile resumes the lawyer again, and so he is lawyer and witness alternately as the case he espouses requires. We certainly have men competent for any office, whose characters need no committees to protect. understand char acter-clearing- p-board is to be organized in this city, to be in session every day, to refi,te any and all charges made or to be made a.

This last affair think will puzzle the committee. Gen. Jackson states that he knew of this horrible corrupt proposal while he was in the Senate, and when MT. Clay's appointment was confirmed never divulged it What let such abom- inable treason pass without proclaiming it |? Suffer one of the greatest appointments in the Republic to pass when he knew the candid ate had been guilty of such vile treason to the people of his country?

A FREEMAN.\n\n The National Gazette gives the following account of the Celebration of the FOURTH in Philadelphia The public proceedings of yesterday embraced as usual parade of military bodies, orations, dinners, and appro- priate theatrical entertainments. Several of the volunteer companies dined in the neigh pouring villages. Throughout the greater part of the day our streets were as quiet as on the Sabbath. Both the party dinners -the Administration. and the Jackson were numerously attended; the number of the guests at the former exceeded, we are told 200; at the latter 400. The details of what passed at each, will. no doubt, be fur nished for the papers. Those who partook of the Jackson dinner at Vauxhall Garden were surprised by the heavy rain in the af- ternoon, and completely drenched. The same accident befel the crowds ofboth sexes in the boats winch studded the river. A mass of water came from the clouds which was al- most sufficient to submerge the boats. We have heard that severals were upset by the squall, and more than one person drowned. The number of the victims is not yet ascer- tained. Some disorders occurred in the steam boats, and many cases of intoxication were observed in the evening, but these come with in the privileges or license of that Anniversa- ry.\n\n Some of the regular toasts at each of the two great dinner parties of the Fourth, con tain strong innuendoes; the volunteer toasts are like sharp cross-fre and in the multi tude of the latter, we do not find one which refers to the day or the occasion. This fact illustrates the influence of the plan of meet ing under party titles and banners on the An niversary of our National Independence. An eminent foreigner travelling in this country, was asked on his return from a certain sec ton of it, what he thought of its religion. \" Religion\" said he, \"I heard nothing of the religion, but heard great deal of the minis ters.asg\n\n PUBLIC ACTS,",

On the arri- val of the canoes, they were found to contain about twentyfv or thirty Indians each. As soon as they had approached within the reach of musket shot a general fire was given from one of them, which wounded Mir. Tucker in the hip so severely that his leg hung quite loose, and MT. Light received ball just be-\n\n low the ribs. The three canoes placed them selves at the how, stern and right side of the boat, so that they had an opportunity of rak- ing in every direction. The fire now com menced from the boat, and had a powerful effect in checking the confidence and fury of the Indians. The captain after firing his own gun, took up that of one of the wounded men, raised it to his shoulder, and was about to discharge it. when ball from the enemy took away the cock; he eOoly turned round, seized brand of fire from the kettle, which served as a cahOOse, and applying 1t to the pan, discharged his piece. A very regular & constant fire was kept up. The captain was just in the act of raising his gun a third time, when a ball passed through his right armand for moment disabled 1t. Scarcely had he recovered from the shock and regained the use of his hand. which had been paraliZed by the wound, when he discovered the Indians in one ofthe canoes about to board the boat in the bow, where the horses were placed, and which covered them in some measure from the sight of the boats crew. They had approached so near, that some of them had actually seized the side of the boat with their hands. Severely wounded as the cap tain was, he caught pair of horseman's pis- tols and rushed forward; on hisapproach the Indians fell back when he discharged one of the pistols at the foremost with effect. After firing the second pistol, he found himself without arms and was forced to retreat, in do- ing which he stepped on pile ofsmall wood which had been prepared for burning in the kettle, when the thought struck him that he could use it to advantage in beating off the enemy, which thought he put into practice, and for some time used so actively and forci- bly, that they were prevented from entering the boat,and ultimately wounded one of them so severely, that with yell they suddenly drewsoif. All the canoes immediately dis continued the contest with Hubbell, ,and went in pursuit of Greathouse's boat which had appeared in sight. Here striking contrast was exhibited to the frinness and intrepidity which had just been displayed. Instead ofre- sisting the attack, the people on board of this boat retired to the cabin in dismay. The In- dians entered it without opposition and row. ed it to shore, where they instantly killed the captain and lad about IA years of age. The women they placed in the centre of their canoes. and manning them with fresh hands determined again on attempting to take Capt Hubbelps boat, and without loss of time pur- sued it. A melancholy alternative now pre- sented itselfto these brave but almost des- bonding heroes, either yieldto their enemies, or run the hazard of killing these unfortunate women, whom the Indians had placed in the canoes with themselves, with the hope of de- irving protection as much as possible be- hind the women, and thereby expose them to the fire of Hubbel and his party. But self presery alton is the first law of human nature, and the captain very justly remarked, there was not humanity in preserving their lives at such sacrifice, merely that they might become victims ofsavage cruelty. at some subsequent period\n\n There were now only four men left on board Capt. Hubbell's boat, capable of mak- tug any defence, and the captain himself se- verely wounded in two places. The second attack was however, received with incredible firmness and vigour, Whenever the Indians would rise to fre,they generally gave the first shotwhich in most instances proved fatal, Not withstanding the disparity ofnumbers, ,and the exhausted condition of Hubbell's party, the Indians in short time showed evident signs of despair in success, ,and the canoes drew off succesively to the shore. Just as the last one was departing Capt. Hubbell called to the h. dian, who was standing in the stern of his canoe, and on his turning round discharged his piece at him. When the smoke, which for moment obstructed the vision was dssi- pated, hewas seen lying on his back, and appeared to be severely, and perhaps mortal ly wounded.\n\n Unfortunately the boat now drifted near to the shore where the Indians were collected, and large concourse ofapparently between & 500, were seen running down on the bank. Ray and Plascut, the only men re- maining unhurt, were placed at the oars, and as the boat was net more than twenty yards from shore, itwas deemed prudent fOrAall to lie down in as safe position as possible, and attempt to push forward with the utmost practicable rapidity. While in this situation, nine balls were shot into ore oar and ten into the other, without touching the rowers, who were hidden from view, and protected by the side of the boat and blankets in the stern. During the frightful exposure to the fire of the savagcs. which continued about twenty",

            "article": "cept Ray and Plascut, were severely wound ed. The women and children were all unin- jured, excepting a little son Of Mrs. Plascut,\n\n who after the conflict was over. came to the captain, and with great c0Olness requested\n\n him to take ball out of his head. On ex-\n\n animation it appeared that ball had passed\n\n through the side of the boat, and had penetra-\n\n ted the Sorehead of this little her3, and re-\n\n mained under the skin. The captain took it l out, when the lad observed \"thot is not 0H,\"\n\n raised his arm, and exhibited piece of hone at the point of his elbow, which had been shot of and hung by the skin. His mother ex- claimed, \"why did you not tell me of this\" :\" |\" Because\" he coolly replied, |\" the captain directed us to he silent during the action, and l thought yOn would he likely to make noise if told you\"\n\n The party made the best Oftheir way down the river-the object was to reach Limestone that night. The captains arm had bled pro- fusely: he was compelled to close the sleeve of his coat in order to retain the blood and to check itS efusion. In this situation he was under the necessity for want of hands, to steer the boat with his left hand, until 10 O clock at night when he was relieved by Mir. Wm. Brooks, who resided near the river,and who was induced by the calls of the suffering party to come out to their assistance. By Mr. Brooks aid, and that of some others who were in the same manner brought to tLeir re- lief, they were enabled to land at. Limestone that night at about l2 o'clock.\n\n Immediately on the arrival of Mir. Brooks, Capt. Hubbell, relieved from labour and re- sponsibiIity sunk under the weight;of pain and fatigue; and for while became entirely in- sensible: When the boat reached Limestone he was unable to walk, and was obliged to be carried up to the tavern. Here he had his wounds dressed, where he continued until he acquired sufficient strength to proceed home ward. A\n\n On their arrival at Limestone. they found a considerable armed force, about tO march against the same Indians, from whose attacks they had so miraculously escaped and SO se- verely suffered. They now learned that on the proceeding Sunday, the same party of h. dians, had cut off detachment of men as- cending the Ohio from Fort Washington at the Mouth of Licking River, and; had killed with their tomahawks, without firing gun,s1 out of2g men of which the detachment con- sisted.\n\n Crowds ofreople as might be expected, came to examine the boat which had been the scene of so much heroistn and such horrid carnage, and to visit the resolute little band,by whom it had been so gallantly and perseveringly defended. On examination it was found that the sides of the boat were lit- orally filled with bullet holes. There was scarcely space of two feet square in the part ahove water, which had not either ball remaing in it or a hole through which one had passed. Some persons who had the curosi, ty to count the number of bullet holes in the blankets on the stern of the boat, affirmed that in the space of five feet sqrare,there were l22.-Four horses out of five were killed, ,and the escape of the fifth appeared almost mi raculOus.\n\n The day after the arrival of Capt. Hubbell and his companions, the five remaining boats which they had passed on the night preced- ing the attack, reached Limestone. Those. on board remarked, that during the action, they distinctly saw the flashes, but could not hear the reports of the guns. The Indians it appears had met with too formidable re- sistance from single boat to attack fleet, and suffered them to pass unmoIested: and since that time it is believed that no boat has been assailed on the Ohio.\n\n The force which marched out to disperse this formidable body of savages, discovered several dead Indians on the shore near the place of action. They also found the bodies of Capt. Greenhouse and of several others, who werein the boat. Most of them appear ed to have been whipped to death as they were stripped, tied to the trees. and marked with the appearance of lashes, and large rods which were evidently worn with use lying near them. .....-",

If they had not con fdence in me to believe, if I was elected, that Iwould call to my aid in the cabinet men of the first virtue, talent and integrity, not to vote for me-\" The second day after this commu- nication and reply, it was announced in the newspapers that MT. Clay had come out O. penly and avOwedly in favor of MT. Adams.\n\n It may be proper to observe that in the supposition that Mir Clay was not privy to the proposition stated, may have done injustice to him; if so, the gentleman informing me can explain.\n\n am, very respectfully. your most ohedi- ent servant, ANDREW JACKSON.\n\n MR. GARTER BEVERLEY.\n\n 1@ln relation to the preceding ,natter,the \" W heeling Gazette of the 30th ult. speak ing as if with \" authority\" says\n\n Wepublish in our papertofto- day copy of a letter from Gen. Jackson to Garter Bever- ley, Esq. who is now in this place, and re- ceived by him in reply to letter which he addressed to the general, requesting confr- nation of the statements which were first published in the Fayetteville Observer,in the form of an anonymous letter, of which Ms. Beverley is now the ayowed author. This letter from Gen. Jackson was, by permission of MT, Beverley, put into the hands of Mr. Clay, on his arrival in this town on the e1st inst. MT. Clay, in the presence of large number of gentlemen, declared in the most solemn and positive manner, that the state- ments contained in the letter 50 far as it con- cerned himself, had no foundation in truth, & 50 far as his knowldge authorized him to speak in behalf of his friends, he could pronounce it equally false and unfounded.\n\n To those, who are anxious to see this mat ter more fully developed, this letter from Gen. Jackson will be deemed valuable ac- quisition. The affair has assumed such a character, that it will admit of a thorough and ample investigation. An issue can now be made up, that will test the true merits of the case. MT. Clay has never shrunk from the most rigid scrutiny into his public character he now professes his readiness as well as his highest satisfaction at the opportunity which is afforded him to meet this reiterated and degrading attack upon his political honor and integrity. He will deem it a duty which he owes himself and to the public, to stand forth and vindicate his character from foul and odous charge, emanating as it does, from such distinguished parsonage as Gen. Jack son. The name of the hero's respectable in former must now be given up, and he must, come forward, and substantiate satisfactoral- ly, the truth of his statements. or be prepar- ed to take his station by the side of kindred accuser, who cried aloud and spared not, until the day of trial. The confidence of MT. Clay's friends in his political honesty, is not to be disturbed by vague and indefinite re- ports, even although Gen. Jackson himself propogates their circulation. He must offer something more than his own conjectures and suppositions to persuade them that Mr. Clay is an unprincipled & profigate politician: They will call for proofs-undeniable proof in the place of unauthorized infercnces and innu- endoes. So much gross and palpable misrep- resentation has been thrown upon the con- duct of MT. Clay, by his political enemies, it cannot be expected that any new charge will be received with ready credulity. He has been visited with a moisture of calumny and abuse which rarely falls to the lot of any man. His public and private character has been as- saulted in every shape which it was possible for political animosity to suggest. He has withstood the storm of the most violent and merciless persecution-frm and undaunted,",

The letter speaks for itself, and we recommend an attentive perusal of it to our readers, as it will certainly lead tO a course of inquiry attended with important results\n\n Nile's Register.\n\n ToMe editors ofthe Commercial Advertiser.\n\n GENTLEMEN-I was formerly Jackson ad- vOcate. My confidence, confess, is every day more and more staggered. His charac- ter bids fair to be made up altogether of ex- plantations, and when it is found necessary to have regular board who appear to be con- tinually in. session to sustain his character, it is more than ever believed character at all suitable for a President of the United States should require. It seems he has recently laid out some new work for these conservators of his good name. Not willing to trust his cause with others, he appears as witness in propria persOne. Like a zealOus advocate, finding the testimony squeeze a little too hard, lays by his official character and offers himself as witness, and after testifyiug awhile resumes the lawyer again, and so he is lawyer and witness alternately as the case he espouses requires. We certainly have men competent for any office, whose characters need no committees to protect. understand char acter-clearing- p-board is to be organized in this city, to be in session every day, to refi,te any and all charges made or to be made a.

This last affair think will puzzle the committee. Gen. Jackson states that he knew of this horrible corrupt proposal while he was in the Senate, and when MT. Clay's appointment was confirmed never divulged it What let such abom- inable treason pass without proclaiming it |? Suffer one of the greatest appointments in the Republic to pass when he knew the candid ate had been guilty of such vile treason to the people of his country? Will they certify he did not know it He has volunteered by hls own letter to fasten upon himself this un- pardonable deTiliction from duty. This must be admitted,or he ;has knowingly stated to the world to dsparage Mr. C., that which he knew to be false.-\" Out of thine own mouth will condemn thee.' A FREEMAN.\n\n The National Gazette gives the following account of the Celebration of the FOURTH in Philadelphia The public proceedings of yesterday embraced as usual parade of military bodies, orations, dinners, and appro- priate theatrical entertainments. Several of the volunteer companies dined in the neigh pouring villages. Throughout the greater part of the day our streets were as quiet as on the Sabbath. Both the party dinners -the Administration. and the Jackson were numerously attended; the number of the guests at the former exceeded, we are told 200; at the latter 400. The details of what passed at each, will. no doubt, be fur nished for the papers. Those who partook of the Jackson dinner at Vauxhall Garden were surprised by the heavy rain in the af- ternoon, and completely drenched. The same accident befel the crowds ofboth sexes in the boats winch studded the river. A mass of water came from the clouds which was al- most sufficient to submerge the boats. We have heard that severals were upset by the squall, and more than one person drowned. The number of the victims is not yet ascer- tained. Some disorders occurred in the steam boats, and many cases of intoxication were observed in the evening, but these come with in the privileges or license of that Anniversa- ry.\n\n Some of the regular toasts at each of the two great dinner parties of the Fourth, con tain strong innuendoes; the volunteer toasts are like sharp cross-fre and in the multi tude of the latter, we do not find one which refers to the day or the occasion. This fact illustrates the influence of the plan of meet ing under party titles and banners on the An niversary of our National Independence. An eminent foreigner travelling in this country, was asked on his return from a certain sec ton of it, what he thought of its religion. \" Religion\" said he, \"I heard nothing of the religion, but heard great deal of the minis ters.asg\n\n PUBLIC ACTS,",

As soon as they had approached within the reach of musket shot a general fire was given from one of them, which wounded Mir. Tucker in the hip so severely that his leg hung quite loose, and MT. Light received ball just be-\n\n low the ribs. The three canoes placed them selves at the how, stern and right side of the boat, so that they had an opportunity of rak- ing in every direction. The fire now com menced from the boat, and had a powerful effect in checking the confidence and fury of the Indians. The captain after firing his own gun, took up that of one of the wounded men, raised it to his shoulder, and was about to discharge it. when ball from the enemy took away the cock; he eOoly turned round, seized brand of fire from the kettle, which served as a cahOOse, and applying 1t to the pan, discharged his piece. A very regular & constant fire was kept up. The captain was just in the act of raising his gun a third time, when a ball passed through his right armand for moment disabled 1t. Scarcely had he recovered from the shock and regained the use of his hand. which had been paraliZed by the wound, when he discovered the Indians in one ofthe canoes about to board the boat in the bow, where the horses were placed, and which covered them in some measure from the sight of the boats crew. They had approached so near, that some of them had actually seized the side of the boat with their hands. Severely wounded as the cap tain was, he caught pair of horseman's pis- tols and rushed forward; on hisapproach the Indians fell back when he discharged one of the pistols at the foremost with effect. After firing the second pistol, he found himself without arms and was forced to retreat, in do- ing which he stepped on pile ofsmall wood which had been prepared for burning in the kettle, when the thought struck him that he could use it to advantage in beating off the enemy, which thought he put into practice, and for some time used so actively and forci- bly, that they were prevented from entering the boat,and ultimately wounded one of them so severely, that with yell they suddenly drewsoif. All the canoes immediately dis continued the contest with Hubbell, ,and went in pursuit of Greathouse's boat which had appeared in sight. Here striking contrast was exhibited to the frinness and intrepidity which had just been displayed. Instead ofre- sisting the attack, the people on board of this boat retired to the cabin in dismay. The In- dians entered it without opposition and row. ed it to shore, where they instantly killed the captain and lad about IA years of age. The women they placed in the centre of their canoes. and manning them with fresh hands determined again on attempting to take Capt Hubbelps boat, and without loss of time pur- sued it. A melancholy alternative now pre- sented itselfto these brave but almost des- bonding heroes, either yieldto their enemies, or run the hazard of killing these unfortunate women, whom the Indians had placed in the canoes with themselves, with the hope of de- irving protection as much as possible be- hind the women, and thereby expose them to the fire of Hubbel and his party. But self presery alton is the first law of human nature, and the captain very justly remarked, there was not humanity in preserving their lives at such sacrifice, merely that they might become victims ofsavage cruelty. at some subsequent period\n\n There were now only four men left on board Capt. Hubbell's boat, capable of mak- tug any defence, and the captain himself se- verely wounded in two places. The second attack was however, received with incredible firmness and vigour, Whenever the Indians would rise to fre,they generally gave the first shotwhich in most instances proved fatal, Not withstanding the disparity ofnumbers, ,and the exhausted condition of Hubbell's party, the Indians in short time showed evident signs of despair in success, ,and the canoes drew off succesively to the shore. Just as the last one was departing Capt. Hubbell called to the h. dian, who was standing in the stern of his canoe, and on his turning round discharged his piece at him. When the smoke, which for moment obstructed the vision was dssi- pated, hewas seen lying on his back, and appeared to be severely, and perhaps mortal ly wounded.\n\n Unfortunately the boat now drifted near to the shore where the Indians were collected, and large concourse ofapparently between & 500, were seen running down on the bank. Ray and Plascut, the only men re- maining unhurt, were placed at the oars, and as the boat was net more than twenty yards from shore, itwas deemed prudent fOrAall to lie down in as safe position as possible, and attempt to push forward with the utmost practicable rapidity. While in this situation, nine balls were shot into ore oar and ten into the other, without touching the rowers, who were hidden from view, and protected by the side of the boat and blankets in the stern.
