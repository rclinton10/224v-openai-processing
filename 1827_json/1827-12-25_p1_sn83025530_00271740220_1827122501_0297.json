Displeased as am at the result OF that\nmatter, do not think MIR. Sanford can in any way\nbe charged with declared partiaty for Duff Green.\nHis vote has been misunderstood You will pro-\nbadly recollect that Mr.. Clayton introduced last\nyear. when this subject under discussion. re-\nsolution establishing that maj rlty OF the Senators\npresent should be necessary Tor the election OF a\nprinter. Duff Green on that occasion had plural\ntv of the votes, and after several ballots, further\nproceedings on the subject was suspended, ON mo-\n\n\nlion of MIR. Benton. On the FIRST occasion tor print\ning, this session. it observed by Mr.. Eaton\nthat there was as yet no printer He then intro\nGuced resolution hat Duff Green. having last year\nreceived plurality of votes. was du' elected un-\nder the joint resolution of the two houess passed III\n49, 9. On this resolution debate arose. 1t was\ncontended on one side. By Messrs. Eaton. Benton,\nand Hayne, that the joint resolution of 1919 was\nstill in full force providing for the manner IN which\nthe work should be done, the securities &c. and\nthat the person having the greatest number OF votes\nshould be elected that the Senate last year. order\ned the election to take place in pursuance Of the\nrule of 1919; that on the day appointed tor the ell\nection, that rule was modified in one particular\nalone, that is, making majority necessary TO a\n| choice, And they further contended that the rule\nof l8l9 if obligatory in one respect, was obligatory\nin all and hence it was not in the power Of the\nSenate to cause the modification without the consent\nOf the House, which had been party to the original\nrule. The resolution offered by MIR. Clayton and\nadopted last year. being thus nugatory, it followed\nthat the election was duly made under the order Of\nthe 18th Of last February for the election, made III\npursuance of the rule of 1919.\n\n\nOn the other side it was urged by Messrs. Cham\nbers, Robbins and Macon, that the joint resolution\nuf 1919 was dead, having been framed, as its words\nimplied, only for particular season that the reso-\nluton of MIR. Clayton was deliberately adopted,\nand under it, the Senate proceeded to its elec-\nton that election having been made on the first,\nsecond and third ballots, the baoting was suspend\ned not upon the ground Of irregularity, but because\nit was inconvenient to go on-no objection being Of\nlered until the third ballot to the rm OF proceeding;\nconsequently no election was made, which was Il n\ngenerally understood.\n\n\nrhe question then occurred upon Mr.. Eaton's re-\nsolution, which was adopted by vote of 25 to l9,\nMIR Sanford and Mr.. Barton of the administration\nparty voting for it, and MIR. Macon of the opposi-\ntion against it.\n\n\nThus you will perceive that the bare question de-\ncded by this vote did not involve an expression of\neither personal or party predictions. 1t was the\nsimple proposition whether the joint resolution OF\n1919 was still in full force and it being declared\nto be so, there call upon the Senators to de-\nsignate their favourte printer by name Under\nthese circumstances it appears to me that there\nmight be conscientious dsagreements. Mr.. Bar\nton, also, who voted for MIR. Eton's resolution, is\nfirm friend of the administration, and Of Gales &\nSeatoD,",

A\nvery extensive examination into the state of prisons\nthroughout the country, has shown the evils exist\ning IN them TO be enormous and that, too general\nly, they are, instead of correctives the very\nries OF vice. Perhaps the most prominent evil is,\nthat OF vicious men being brought together in great\nnumbers, especially at night to teach one another\nlniqulty, and harden one another in sin. The con-\nsequence OF this has been, that the prisoner when\nreleased, has, in too many instances gone forth on\nly to commit new outrages and that very large\nportion of convicts have consisted of those who have\nbeen recommtted. The State prison recently es-\ntablished at .auburn, N. York. one which this So\nciety recommend Z\" model worthy ofthe world\nimitation some of the characteristics of which are\nthe following neaness, industry, and the almost\nentire subordinaon and subdued feeling Of the con-\nyicts. In their solitary cells, they spend the night\n| with no other book but the Bible; and at sunrise,\n| they proceed, in military order with the lock\nmarch, to their workshops thence, in the same\norder to the common hall, where they partake Of\ntheir frugal meal in silence. Not even whisper is\nhhard.

They attend to their business\nfrom morning to night the work is laid aside al\nat once, and the convicts return in military order\nto their solitary cells where they can, if they\nchoose, read the Scriptures undisturbed, and ther\nreflect, in silence, the errors of theirlives. They\nmust not disturb their fellow prisoners by even ;\nwhisper. Each cell is provided with Bible, OF\nTestament, by law of the State. The prisoners\nalso receive the undivided attention of wise ant\nfaithful and religious teacher, who spends all hi\ntime in the prison visiting the sick, teaching those\n\n\nwho cannot read, preaching in the chapel, ON th'\ni Sabbath, the unsearchable riches of Christ, ant\ngoing from cell to cell to administer the reproof\n\n\nand consultations of religion to individuals.

Displeased as am at the result OF that\nmatter, do not think MIR. Sanford can in any way\nbe charged with declared partiaty for Duff Green.\nHis vote has been misunderstood You will pro-\nbadly recollect that Mr.. Clayton introduced last\nyear. when this subject under discussion. re-\nsolution establishing that maj rlty OF the Senators\npresent should be necessary Tor the election OF a\nprinter. Duff Green on that occasion had plural\ntv of the votes, and after several ballots, further\nproceedings on the subject was suspended, ON mo-\n\n\nlion of MIR. Benton. On the FIRST occasion tor print\ning, this session. it observed by Mr.. Eaton\nthat there was as yet no printer He then intro\nGuced resolution hat Duff Green. having last year\nreceived plurality of votes. was du' elected un-\nder the joint resolution of the two houess passed III\n49, 9. On this resolution debate arose. 1t was\ncontended on one side. By Messrs. Eaton. Benton,\nand Hayne, that the joint resolution of 1919 was\nstill in full force providing for the manner IN which\nthe work should be done, the securities &c. and\nthat the person having the greatest number OF votes\nshould be elected that the Senate last year. order\ned the election to take place in pursuance Of the\nrule of 1919; that on the day appointed tor the ell\nection, that rule was modified in one particular\nalone, that is, making majority necessary TO a\n| choice, And they further contended that the rule\nof l8l9 if obligatory in one respect, was obligatory\nin all and hence it was not in the power Of the\nSenate to cause the modification without the consent\nOf the House, which had been party to the original\nrule. The resolution offered by MIR. Clayton and\nadopted last year. being thus nugatory, it followed\nthat the election was duly made under the order Of\nthe 18th Of last February for the election, made III\npursuance of the rule of 1919.\n\n\nOn the other side it was urged by Messrs. Cham\nbers, Robbins and Macon, that the joint resolution\nuf 1919 was dead, having been framed, as its words\nimplied, only for particular season that the reso-\nluton of MIR. Clayton was deliberately adopted,\nand under it, the Senate proceeded to its elec-\nton that election having been made on the first,\nsecond and third ballots, the baoting was suspend\ned not upon the ground Of irregularity, but because\nit was inconvenient to go on-no objection being Of\nlered until the third ballot to the rm OF proceeding;\nconsequently no election was made, which was Il n\ngenerally understood.\n\n\nrhe question then occurred upon Mr.. Eaton's re-\nsolution, which was adopted by vote of 25 to l9,\nMIR Sanford and Mr.. Barton of the administration\nparty voting for it, and MIR. Macon of the opposi-\ntion against it.\n\n\nThus you will perceive that the bare question de-\ncded by this vote did not involve an expression of\neither personal or party predictions. 1t was the\nsimple proposition whether the joint resolution OF\n1919 was still in full force and it being declared\nto be so, there call upon the Senators to de-\nsignate their favourte printer by name Under\nthese circumstances it appears to me that there\nmight be conscientious dsagreements. Mr.. Bar\nton, also, who voted for MIR. Eton's resolution, is\nfirm friend of the administration, and Of Gales &\nSeatoD,",

            "article": "Prison Discipline Society, formed in Boston,\n\n\nJune 80, 1895.\n\n\nObject, to promote the improvement of Public\nPrisons, particularly within the United States. A\nvery extensive examination into the state of prisons\nthroughout the country, has shown the evils exist\ning IN them TO be enormous and that, too general\nly, they are, instead of correctives the very\nries OF vice. Perhaps the most prominent evil is,\nthat OF vicious men being brought together in great\nnumbers, especially at night to teach one another\nlniqulty, and harden one another in sin. The con-\nsequence OF this has been, that the prisoner when\nreleased, has, in too many instances gone forth on\nly to commit new outrages and that very large\nportion of convicts have consisted of those who have\nbeen recommtted. The State prison recently es-\ntablished at .auburn, N. York. one which this So\nciety recommend Z\" model worthy ofthe world\nimitation some of the characteristics of which are\nthe following neaness, industry, and the almost\nentire subordinaon and subdued feeling Of the con-\nyicts. In their solitary cells, they spend the night\n| with no other book but the Bible; and at sunrise,\n| they proceed, in military order with the lock\nmarch, to their workshops thence, in the same\norder to the common hall, where they partake Of\ntheir frugal meal in silence. Not even whisper is\nhhard. The convicts are seated in single file, al\nnarrow tables, with their backs towards the centre\nso that there can be no interchange Of signs From\nend of the shop to the other, you may pass SOC\nconvcts without seeing one leave his work. or turn\nhis head to gaze. They attend to their business\nfrom morning to night the work is laid aside al\nat once, and the convicts return in military order\nto their solitary cells where they can, if they\nchoose, read the Scriptures undisturbed, and ther\nreflect, in silence, the errors of theirlives. They\nmust not disturb their fellow prisoners by even ;\nwhisper. Each cell is provided with Bible, OF\nTestament, by law of the State. The prisoners\nalso receive the undivided attention of wise ant\nfaithful and religious teacher, who spends all hi\ntime in the prison visiting the sick, teaching those\n\n\nwho cannot read, preaching in the chapel, ON th'\ni Sabbath, the unsearchable riches of Christ, ant\ngoing from cell to cell to administer the reproof\n\n\nand consultations of religion to individuals. In thi\nprison there is exclusion of all the positive evil\nof the old SYSTEM which arise from cro1yded rooms\npick pockets, tieves ancendiares, and co,nteeiters\n' and from unnatural crime.-A number ofnew pri\n\n\nsons already erecting on the plan of that at Au\nburn, and it may be confidently hoped, that mos\n= salutary reform will ultimately be effected in tn\ngeneral system of Prison Discipline\n\n\ny We are informed (says the Kentucky Reporter,\nd that the following members who voted for Mr\nn Ward the Jackson candidate for Speaker, con\n\n\nsidered by their constituents, Administration men\nd when they were elected viz =\n\n\ne Messrs.
