All en-\n\n\ndesvours to get the vessels off proved aSor-\n\n\ntive, and the Congress and Sarand immedl-\n\n\nately anchored near them.

How\nthis will operate upon the interest of the\nKind mediator, Great Britain, time must de-\nvelope.\n\n\nWe are pleased to find in the Philadelphia\n\n\nAurora the following explicit contradiction OF\nthe unpleasant intelligence from Colombia, re-\nGently reported by an arrival at New-York. 1t\nwill be pewsed with satisfaction by every we'll\nwshrr to the cause of freedom and good govern\nncnt.\n\n\nWe state upon the best authority, that the ad-\n\n\nvices from Colombia, by the lAthcnian at New\n\n\nYork from Carthagena, as first published in some\n\n\nofthe New-York papers, are from source not\nentitled to credit. Letters and papers to the\nlatest dates received in this city from Colombia,\n\n\nuaeduiv1cally show that vito President SASrAN-\n\n\nDEp continues to enjoy undiininished popularity\n\n\nin that country. A perfectly good understand\n! in.r subsists between him and BOLIVAR, the only\n\n\ndifference even ofopitjaa being that Santandcr\n\n\nhas never approved o the snt'-Tcpnbhcan tca'\n\n\nlures in the Bolivian constitution. lie has, how\n\n\never, earnestly insisted upon the continuance OF\n\n\nthe I.iberator in the station of President of the\n\n\nrepublic, and the Congress has refused to accept\nI his own resignation of the vicc-presllency.\n\n\nG. fp, in Ct\n\n\nrebellion of Bustalucnt, or sanctioning his\n\n\nattempt to separate the southern depart\n\n\nment from the republic. that all his feelings\n\n\naud scntjments were opposed to the conduct\n\n\nof that officer, and Busamenti was on his\n\n\nway to Colombia as prisoner to the vice\n\n\nPresident: And the moment Bolivar heard\n\n\nOf his beng taken. and tie attempted revo-\n\n\nluton crushed. he countrrnanded the march\n\n\nof the troops destined to quell his rcbcllious\n\n\nmovements IN the South of the repub'ic.--\n\n\nSantander is one Of the purest republican\n\n\npat,jots in Colombia, and has never been for\n\n\nan instant suspected Of peculation, that sto-\n\n\nry having been fabricated by few discon-\n\n\ntented persons, who. for their own miscon-\n\n\nduct. had lost or been dismissed trom OF\n\n\nfce. The idea Of his 4 wing from Lima, up\n\n\non the approach Of Bolivar to Bosota, is CON\n\n\nsidered idle and absurd, and sheer inven'\n, tion of some worthless individual.

At terc'\nclock they discovered the Brazilian squad\nron of 1S sail, which gave chase. About this\n\n\ntime the wind changed and Brown altered\n\n\nhis course, and SO continued until next morn\n\n\ning, when the Republic and Independence\n\n\ngrounded oil the point Of Santiago. All en-\n\n\ndesvours to get the vessels off proved aSor-\n\n\ntive, and the Congress and Sarand immedl-\n\n\nately anchored near them. The cnemynow\n\n\ndrew up and opened fire which was re-\n\n\nturned, for several hours, when they ceased\n\n\nand retired, apparently with some OF their\n\n\nvessels crippled. In the mean time, the\n\n\nCongress had been despatched to Buenos\n\n\nAyres but the wind being light and the en-\n\n\nemy opposing her. she was obliged to run\n\n\ninto Ensenada. During the night OF tho fth\n\n\nevery effort was made to get the grounded\n,;+bn hp\n\n\n9Th at O'Clock in the morning, the enemy\n\n\nagain bore down upon them and commenced\n\n\nall attack by placing themselves in rakins\n\n\nposition: but several of the smaller vessels\n\n\nwere soon beaten off The Independence\n\n\nand Ssrandi. had. by this time. expended\n\n\ntheir powder, and were in Dad state; and\n: finding it impossible to save the Republic,\n\n\nher officers and crew were embarked on\n\n\nboard the Sarandi, and she was set fire to.\nThe enemy took possession OF the lndepcn-\ndencc, which was by this time complete\nwreck, and night put an end to the contest.\n) During the action the most daring courage\nand intrepidity was manifested by the crews\n, of the Spanish vessels. The Independence\n, fired 314e shot in two days A heavy fris\n, ate anchored breast Of her, and commenced\nr deliberate fire upon her with \"a and 81 10\n\n\nchain and double headed shot, Two hundred\n\n\nof which struck her, and killed and wound\n0 ed from so to 20 of her crew.
