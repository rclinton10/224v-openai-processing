The present misunderstanding between the two countries, on the subjects of the Col onial Trade, and the Boundary Line, to- gether with some other questions which must be agitated between the course ct this and the next year, confirm us Tn the opinion that is both our duty and our ln- terest to be prepared for the worst, while we have an opportunity of endeavorlng to do so.-City Gazette.\n\n The Editor of tho Democratic Press offers the following as his objections to the election of Gen.

His claims and qualifications are wholly Military and founded on Military services his whole life shows that that implicit obedience so essential in soldiers, has been rigourously exacted by him on all occasions but he has not been obedient even in military matters, when orders have been issued from the highest constitution al authority. There is abundant evidence of this truth, in the correspondence of Gen. Jackson with Gen. Scott and Gov. Rabun.\n\n 2.I Gen.

The next day he wandered about the town, appeared ap- prehensive that he was pursued, and was last seen entering piece of woods above the bend of the Connecticut. On Sum day last, his body was found in ravine which had been filled water few days be- fore, by the rise of the river. A jury of inquest was summoned, and their verdict was, that he came to his death by drown- ing while in a state of mental derange- ment, produced by incorporate drinking His name, we understand, was Joseph Richards, and he had resided at Concord, in this State.\n\n Lime necessary for peGs.-It is observ- ed, that the common pea, whether white or gray, cannot be reared to perfection in any field which has not been either natur- ally or arti6cially inprcgnated with some calc0reous matter. And hence it is supp posed to happen, that peas are rarely cnl- tivated universally as field crop, unless in those parts of the country where either lime, mari or chalk abounds, or upon strong clays; except, indeed, on the sea coast, where shell-ish are often catched in abundance, and where the fields are n,anured with their shells in state of mixture with dung. But it is remarkable, that soil that could scarcely have brought one pea to perfection, although richly manured with dung, from their running too much to haulm, and after blessoming, dying away without becoming ripe, if it has once lime applied upon it, is capable, when properly prepared in other resp ects, of producing plentiful crops of peas ever afterwards. It is further remarked by the same writer, on the result of an ex- pertinent, in which the ridge of field had been missed in lining, produced no wheat, while all the other parts afforded full crop, that lime or some calcareous mate- rial is equally necessary for the production of good wheat crops, as for those of the pea kind. The general observation that the wheat, where this sort of manure has been employed, is thinner in the skin, more plump and yields better, seems also to favour the same conclusion. Im- preparations of this sort appear, likewise, it is supposed, particularly favourable for the production of barley crops, much more SO, especially if in large proportions, than for those of oats.-Farmer's CompDnien.\n\n 1he preservation of teeth.-It is the concern of each individual to cherish and improve his own physical system-as it is the province to repair and restore this whenever it is injured by accident or im- paired by disease. These respective off, ces, though they often more or less run in each other, are instances quite distinct as in the management of the teeth. Tbe possessor has merely to keep the teett clean this being all that is requisite fol their preservation the dentist must dc the rest.\n\n This keeping the teeth free from impu' rites is indispensable to their soundnes' and good appearance. To suffer tho\n\n particles of food and other offending ma\n\n terials, which are constantly collecting a\n\n bout them, to remain, is to favo UT the pro\n\n duction and activity of those causes whicl\n\n effect their ruin. Whatever, therefore, i\n\n best suited to keep these instruments clean, is also best suited to prevent thei discoloration and decay. Whoever is ac' customed to the luxury of clean mouth and teeth, feels the want of his refresh ment as strongly, and enjoys it as highly as ba,her does pure skin.\n\n We every day meet with reputable peo. pie who mean to be neat, and have the satisfaction ofimagining they are so, ant yet they neither bathe the skin nor rins\n\n the mouth Their standard of physica\n\n purity must be very low, for how can neat ness consist with neglected surface and mouth Some young persons, who arc pleasing and estimable in other respects seem to have no idea of tho unpleasant effect which the sordid state of their teeth must have on their acquaintance and asso. ciatss. To see the bloom and freshness Oi youth, in connection with yellow and GOV. einred teeth, and an offensive breath, are altogether from total neglect of the mouth, is grossly inccngruous, if not dis gusting.' Common sense on the contrary, with good manners, and proper attention to personal cleanliness, makes one current and acceptable every where.-Boston Med.

The next day he wandered about the town, appeared ap- prehensive that he was pursued, and was last seen entering piece of woods above the bend of the Connecticut. On Sum day last, his body was found in ravine which had been filled water few days be- fore, by the rise of the river. A jury of inquest was summoned, and their verdict was, that he came to his death by drown- ing while in a state of mental derange- ment, produced by incorporate drinking His name, we understand, was Joseph Richards, and he had resided at Concord, in this State.\n\n Lime necessary for peGs.-It is observ- ed, that the common pea, whether white or gray, cannot be reared to perfection in any field which has not been either natur- ally or arti6cially inprcgnated with some calc0reous matter. And hence it is supp posed to happen, that peas are rarely cnl- tivated universally as field crop, unless in those parts of the country where either lime, mari or chalk abounds, or upon strong clays; except, indeed, on the sea coast, where shell-ish are often catched in abundance, and where the fields are n,anured with their shells in state of mixture with dung. But it is remarkable, that soil that could scarcely have brought one pea to perfection, although richly manured with dung, from their running too much to haulm, and after blessoming, dying away without becoming ripe, if it has once lime applied upon it, is capable, when properly prepared in other resp ects, of producing plentiful crops of peas ever afterwards. It is further remarked by the same writer, on the result of an ex- pertinent, in which the ridge of field had been missed in lining, produced no wheat, while all the other parts afforded full crop, that lime or some calcareous mate- rial is equally necessary for the production of good wheat crops, as for those of the pea kind. The general observation that the wheat, where this sort of manure has been employed, is thinner in the skin, more plump and yields better, seems also to favour the same conclusion. Im- preparations of this sort appear, likewise, it is supposed, particularly favourable for the production of barley crops, much more SO, especially if in large proportions, than for those of oats.-Farmer's CompDnien.\n\n 1he preservation of teeth.-It is the concern of each individual to cherish and improve his own physical system-as it is the province to repair and restore this whenever it is injured by accident or im- paired by disease. These respective off, ces, though they often more or less run in each other, are instances quite distinct as in the management of the teeth. Tbe possessor has merely to keep the teett clean this being all that is requisite fol their preservation the dentist must dc the rest.\n\n This keeping the teeth free from impu' rites is indispensable to their soundnes' and good appearance. To suffer tho\n\n particles of food and other offending ma\n\n terials, which are constantly collecting a\n\n bout them, to remain, is to favo UT the pro\n\n duction and activity of those causes whicl\n\n effect their ruin. Whatever, therefore, i\n\n best suited to keep these instruments clean, is also best suited to prevent thei discoloration and decay. Whoever is ac' customed to the luxury of clean mouth and teeth, feels the want of his refresh ment as strongly, and enjoys it as highly as ba,her does pure skin.\n\n We every day meet with reputable peo. pie who mean to be neat, and have the satisfaction ofimagining they are so, ant yet they neither bathe the skin nor rins\n\n the mouth Their standard of physica\n\n purity must be very low, for how can neat ness consist with neglected surface and mouth Some young persons, who arc pleasing and estimable in other respects seem to have no idea of tho unpleasant effect which the sordid state of their teeth must have on their acquaintance and asso. ciatss. To see the bloom and freshness Oi youth, in connection with yellow and GOV. einred teeth, and an offensive breath, are altogether from total neglect of the mouth, is grossly inccngruous, if not dis gusting.' Common sense on the contrary, with good manners, and proper attention to personal cleanliness, makes one current and acceptable every where.-Boston Med.

The example was initiated by It. Gov. Collins, who gave fifty dol- lars for the. same object. Gov. fenner says he was induced in part to make this donation by the consideration that on these occasions some of the people indulge to excess in drinking, and he. wished to show his disapprobation of intemperance, and to assist in preventing it.-[solsm Goz.l",
