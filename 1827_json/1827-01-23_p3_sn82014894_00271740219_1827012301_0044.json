The Engine from the Capitol\n| Hill, with its hose, was under way in few minuie\nafter the fire discovered. About three hundtec\npersons from the Navy Yard headed by Captain\nBooth, were under way almost soon, but, having\nfurther to 60, did not arrive quite as early on the\nground. The Engine from the Post Office Depart\nrnent, with its me hose, go. under way as soon as\nthe fire was ascertained TO be serious, and had lus\nstarted when sn express arrived to our Mayor from\nthe Mayor OF Alexandra, soliciting aid upon which\n'he Engine Of the Second ward and that from the\nFirst were notified and were under way. Nor were\nour Georgetown neighbors behind hand with grea,\n| spirit they went down in numbers in carriages, on\nhorseback. and on foot carrying also, it is believed,\ntheir engine. All the Marines on this station we re\nalso carried down by Captain Hocip. under the\norders Of COL Henderson, and carrying an engine\nwith them and though they did not arrive until\nthe fire was got under, afforded important service\nguards. The whole number Of persons who went\nfrom this side Of the river could be less than\nthousand. II we appear 10 dwell too much upon\nthis public spirited conduct Of our oilizens on this\noccasion. let it be recollected that the distance 10\nAlexandria from most of thr points started from\nwas seven miles, and that the engines and men ar\n\n\n\n\n\nling. II any other cause for exuItaion is thought\nnecessary to justify it, let it be found in the fact,\nthat the FIRE arrested. and vast amount Of\nproperty rescued from the jaws OF destruction, by\nthe aid thus afforded The first succor from The\ncity arrived about eleven o'clock, and was followed\nby successive supplies Our friends at Alexandra,\nexhausted by fatigue and anxiety, were not employed\nin endeavering to cave their individual property, and\nwithout the excellent apparatus of hose, SC. which\npe haus pnf OH ~ suith fpu rflr.\ning element.

The .umber OF Houses destroyed,\nbesides back buildings. about forty-and the\nvalue Of the Houses and goods destroyed can hardly\nhave fallen short Of two hundred thousand dollars.\nSome Of The property was insured, but 10 what ex.\ntent we have not heard: the Fire Insurance Com\npany OF Alexandria will, i, il supposed be consid-\ncradle loser by the fire The principal sufferers by\nloss Of property are.
