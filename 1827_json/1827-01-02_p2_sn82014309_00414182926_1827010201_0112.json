Ansel Sterling was nominated last spring as aScandidate for an election to the next Congress instead of the Hon. Orange Merwn. My surprise was not occasioned by the request merely, but because it seemed to Sterling. As none of your correspondents have enabled you to comply with the request of the Farmer. I shall myself attempt it, and this I feel myself competent to do, because unless am much deceived, the reasons are known to me. In the first place, Mr. Stir ling has long been known and esteemed as one of the most intelligent, frank, and fearless re- publicans of the County, and has ever been found most faithful friend and able surpor- ter of the present administration ofthe State. As a member of Congress, Mir. Sterling it is believed gave universal satisfaction to his con stitucnts, and an attendance of four sessions seemed to point him out as equally, if not bet ter, qualified to discharge the duties of rep resentatiye in Congress than any other person in the County. It would seem that these req sons were asufIicient justification of the nom ination of Mr. Stirling. But it has been inti- mated inprivate circles that an undue inllu- ence was exerted to produce the nomination. The suggestion is dishonourable imputation upon the intelligence and independence of the respectable republican representative of this County in the last legislature. The facts are these; at the first meeting of the republican members ofthe County, Samuel Church, Esq. was nominated as candidate for member of Congress; a few days after this, Mir. Church gave notice to the gentleman who olIiciated as clerk to the meeting, that he should decline the nomination which had been made of him. self, not having before that time intimated to MT. Sterling or any one else, his determina- ton on this subject. And on tue same day and within few hours afterwards \"a second meeting was convened at which nineteensre- publican members were present, when Mir. Sterling received IA votes without having re- ceived any previous intimation of the wishes or opinions of the gentlemen composing the meeting.\n\n This sir is correct statement of the trans action and the reasons of it, and affords evi- dence of the high estimation in which Mir. Stirling is held by the republicans ofthis coun- ty. ANOTHER FARMER.\n\n To the Editor of the County Post.\n\n SlR-I observe that you have published in your paper of this week, the resolutions a. dopted by the late meeting of republicans in Hartford county, with an editorial comment upon them. Although may differ from you in opinion, with regard to the expediency and propriety ofa measure proposed by that mee-",

In answer to this mention of the word of God, he said, \"When scme wicked people took an adultress to Jesus sChrist to be punished, lie did not punisl. her, but told her to go back again\"-and here left the passage, so that the people who believed what the Capt. said supposed that our Lord commended the woman for adultery.\n\n Kaahumanu said to him, \"We have turned to the Lord, and we wish our peo- ple to do the same-for this reason we have laid the law.

But some of the principal papers of the nation did glve it a place, with editorial surmises not cal culated greatly to preposscss the pubic mind in favor of tho party who were the principal sufferers. The sightof private letter, however, from the Rev. MT Rich- ards. who was at the island of Oahu at the time, received last week by friend ill this city, perfectly satisfies US of the truth of the fact, and the general merits of the case. From this letter, and from other creditable and decided evidence on the point, we do not hesitate to assert that the Missionaries had been before, and were al that time, acting only in their appropriate character and sphere-that there was no interference on their part in the commer- cial or civil affairs of the government, and that the aggression on the rights and laws ofthe nation-the fault and the infamy be- long exclusively to the commander & crew of the Dolphin.\n\n It is fact extensively known, that the intercourse offoreign vessels with the lsl- ands of the Pacific, is attended with the most unbridled and most unblushing icen- tiousness, and at no place was this licen- .tiousness more unlimited & more barefaced tlaamat the Sandwich Islands. The es- tabIishment of mission of Christian min isters and teachers there, as might well be supposed, soon threw light on the existing abominations of the land, even in the view of the heather themselves, and in the course of very few years, the leading per sons in the government became so fully convinced of the disgrace and enormity of prevalent habits of open licentiousness,th that they determined to suppress them. Alaw was accordingly made and proclaimed nearly two years since, prohibiting native females from going on board ships for pur- poses of yice--the penalty was the dis pleasure of the Chiefs and imprisonment.\n\n 1t was the existence of this law, as it ap- pears, and the strictness with which it was enforced, that excited the riot. And we are sorry to perceive, from the following extracts from Mir. R's letter, to how great an extent the Captain of the Dolphin was accessory, by his example, in the insult and violence of his crew.\n\n After the mention of other subjects, this affair is thus introduced :-\n\n must now give you d history of the conduct of Capt. Percival, so far as am acquainted with 1t. On his first arrival,he treated the missionaries with tolcrable po- iteness. In one of his first interviews with Mir. Bingham, however, he expressed his extreme regret, that females were prohibi- ted going on board vessels. He soon be- gan to drop hints against the Mission, and in my presence, ridiculed our attemps to instruct the people. He also made a for nal request of Mir.

A new nomination if made will be in direct opposition to nomination previ- Ously made, and made in a manner which has been sanctioned by the support of the rerub. lican party, ever since that party has been as- cendant in this state. Now it is plain, that the direct tendency of this will be, to sow dis senson among the republican ranks. It can- not be supposed. that the nomination which\n\n has already been made, will be silently aban- doned. Some of the electors will have their personal friends among the caucus candidates, and the caucus nomination will afford at least\n\n a hope ofelecting them. Many, perhaps with out very sufficient reasons, will be attached to \" the good old way and many will fear that ''an enemy hath done ths.\" The seve- ral nominations are always published in the newspapers on the eve of an election. Some ofthe republican papers have already expres- sed their decided appreciation of the nomina- ton which has already been made. They will undoubtedly, if they act consistently ,pub- fish this nomination, and encourage their friends to support it. Now sir, it is well known to every one who is in the least conyersant lsts here, an active, powerful, and well organ l lzed minority, who are unremtting and until ring in their efforts, to regain the power they\n\n once possessed; and who after having percci- we'd how nnavang was their opposition 10 the consolidated strength of the republican 1 party, have at length adopted as their motto\n\n the maxim, \" divide and conquer\" The eX-\n\n istence of such grand division in the repub-\n\n !ican party as new nomination will ineyita- bly produce, will be hailed by tho ftderalists,\n\n as an event most suspicious to their purposes.\n\n A mighty and united effort will be made to\n\n regain their lost ascendancy, and let us not\n\n rest in mistaken security. The result of a re- cent election in sister state should warn us ! how much may he effected by secret intrigue; and how different the result of an election\n\n may be from the wishes and expectations of a maiority of the electors. But let us for\n\n moment enquire, what is the occasion which calls so loudly for d new nomination <? Is the\n\n system of nomination by a legislative caucus pernIcious in it's tendency? Is it dangerous to\n\n virtually entrust the whole appointing power\n\n with the legislature, because fits isinvesting them\n\n with too much power: and they may abuse it!\n\n But the question iss what evil hus been done,\n\n for the caucus can have no opportunity ofex- ercising their powers until after the next elee- tion. The argument then, that because fil-\n\n ture danger is to be apprehended from the nn- due powers of legislative caucus, therefore the nomination which such a. caucus has al- ready made and published cannot with safe\n\n ty be supported by the electors, wholly fails If the caucus have done right it is no objection\n\n to their doings, that at the time they did so.\n\n they had the power ofs doing wrong. The\n\n fact that governor is clothed with extensive powers does not imply that his subjects do\n\n not enjoy liberty, if they are secured against\n\n the improper exercise of those powers. An\n\n absolute monarchy would be the form of gov\n\n ernment best calculated to promote the hap PlnesS of the subject, and to secure his rights, if he might always have ruler in whom, should be united the attributes of wisdom, and goodness, commensurate in degree with his power. It is theimpossibillty of this, arising from the imperfectiOn Of human nature, WI hich\n\n renders popular form of government the\n\n most free. Since then all apprehension of future danger, from the undue powers of tt\n\n legislative caucus, held last spring, and then\n\n dissolved, and reduced to its elements, is me- cessarily precluded, let us enquire what have ] that caucus done? Will it he said that they\n\n have not nominated men of long tried attach ment to the republican cause ? men who have been often honoured by the support of the",

            "article": "\n\n Mir. SMITH,\n\n SIR-1n your paper of the 18th ult. I read with no small degree of surprise, an enquiry, signed $ A Farmer\" asking you the reasons why the Hon. Ansel Sterling was nominated last spring as aScandidate for an election to the next Congress instead of the Hon. Orange Merwn. My surprise was not occasioned by the request merely, but because it seemed to Sterling. As none of your correspondents have enabled you to comply with the request of the Farmer. I shall myself attempt it, and this I feel myself competent to do, because unless am much deceived, the reasons are known to me. In the first place, Mr. Stir ling has long been known and esteemed as one of the most intelligent, frank, and fearless re- publicans of the County, and has ever been found most faithful friend and able surpor- ter of the present administration ofthe State. As a member of Congress, Mir. Sterling it is believed gave universal satisfaction to his con stitucnts, and an attendance of four sessions seemed to point him out as equally, if not bet ter, qualified to discharge the duties of rep resentatiye in Congress than any other person in the County. It would seem that these req sons were asufIicient justification of the nom ination of Mr. Stirling. But it has been inti- mated inprivate circles that an undue inllu- ence was exerted to produce the nomination. The suggestion is dishonourable imputation upon the intelligence and independence of the respectable republican representative of this County in the last legislature. The facts are these; at the first meeting of the republican members ofthe County, Samuel Church, Esq. was nominated as candidate for member of Congress; a few days after this, Mir. Church gave notice to the gentleman who olIiciated as clerk to the meeting, that he should decline the nomination which had been made of him. self, not having before that time intimated to MT. Sterling or any one else, his determina- ton on this subject. And on tue same day and within few hours afterwards \"a second meeting was convened at which nineteensre- publican members were present, when Mir. Sterling received IA votes without having re- ceived any previous intimation of the wishes or opinions of the gentlemen composing the meeting.\n\n This sir is correct statement of the trans action and the reasons of it, and affords evi- dence of the high estimation in which Mir. Stirling is held by the republicans ofthis coun- ty. ANOTHER FARMER.\n\n To the Editor of the County Post.\n\n SlR-I observe that you have published in your paper of this week, the resolutions a. dopted by the late meeting of republicans in Hartford county, with an editorial comment upon them.

Bingham's with heavy clubs, and beat in the windows and attempted to force the door; but from some cause turned their clubs against each other, till one was laid senseless on the ground. In the mean time, the battle was\n\n renewed in the other yard---stones & clubs flew i4every direction, till Capt. Percival\n\n arrived, and the men were secured and de-\n\n livered to his charge. 2 he whole number\n\n of sailors was near twenty-nearly all from\n\n the Dolphin, a few from the whale ships, |",

But some of the principal papers of the nation did glve it a place, with editorial surmises not cal culated greatly to preposscss the pubic mind in favor of tho party who were the principal sufferers. The sightof private letter, however, from the Rev. MT Rich- ards. who was at the island of Oahu at the time, received last week by friend ill this city, perfectly satisfies US of the truth of the fact, and the general merits of the case. From this letter, and from other creditable and decided evidence on the point, we do not hesitate to assert that the Missionaries had been before, and were al that time, acting only in their appropriate character and sphere-that there was no interference on their part in the commer- cial or civil affairs of the government, and that the aggression on the rights and laws ofthe nation-the fault and the infamy be- long exclusively to the commander & crew of the Dolphin.\n\n It is fact extensively known, that the intercourse offoreign vessels with the lsl- ands of the Pacific, is attended with the most unbridled and most unblushing icen- tiousness, and at no place was this licen- .tiousness more unlimited & more barefaced tlaamat the Sandwich Islands. The es- tabIishment of mission of Christian min isters and teachers there, as might well be supposed, soon threw light on the existing abominations of the land, even in the view of the heather themselves, and in the course of very few years, the leading per sons in the government became so fully convinced of the disgrace and enormity of prevalent habits of open licentiousness,th that they determined to suppress them. Alaw was accordingly made and proclaimed nearly two years since, prohibiting native females from going on board ships for pur- poses of yice--the penalty was the dis pleasure of the Chiefs and imprisonment.\n\n 1t was the existence of this law, as it ap- pears, and the strictness with which it was enforced, that excited the riot. And we are sorry to perceive, from the following extracts from Mir. R's letter, to how great an extent the Captain of the Dolphin was accessory, by his example, in the insult and violence of his crew.\n\n After the mention of other subjects, this affair is thus introduced :-\n\n must now give you d history of the conduct of Capt. Percival, so far as am acquainted with 1t. On his first arrival,he treated the missionaries with tolcrable po- iteness. In one of his first interviews with Mir. Bingham, however, he expressed his extreme regret, that females were prohibi- ted going on board vessels. He soon be- gan to drop hints against the Mission, and in my presence, ridiculed our attemps to instruct the people. He also made a for nal request of Mir. Bingham, \"that none ofthe Missionaries might be present when he conversed with tho Chiefs, even if the",

            "article": "cussiOn of every subje ct of pubIc interest and importance. With the first of four resolutions adopted by that meeting, am not disposed to find fault; but they impressed''me on read\n\n ing them with the idea, that they were merely\n\n introductory to the fifth, and that this disclO-\n\n es the true and grand object of that meeting.\n\n This cOntemplates the calling of convention\n\n for the purpose of making new nomination. Such a measure view as objectionable on this ground. A new nomination if made will be in direct opposition to nomination previ- Ously made, and made in a manner which has been sanctioned by the support of the rerub. lican party, ever since that party has been as- cendant in this state. Now it is plain, that the direct tendency of this will be, to sow dis senson among the republican ranks. It can- not be supposed. that the nomination which\n\n has already been made, will be silently aban- doned. Some of the electors will have their personal friends among the caucus candidates, and the caucus nomination will afford at least\n\n a hope ofelecting them. Many, perhaps with out very sufficient reasons, will be attached to \" the good old way and many will fear that ''an enemy hath done ths.\" The seve- ral nominations are always published in the newspapers on the eve of an election. Some ofthe republican papers have already expres- sed their decided appreciation of the nomina- ton which has already been made. They will undoubtedly, if they act consistently ,pub- fish this nomination, and encourage their friends to support it. Now sir, it is well known to every one who is in the least conyersant lsts here, an active, powerful, and well organ l lzed minority, who are unremtting and until ring in their efforts, to regain the power they\n\n once possessed; and who after having percci- we'd how nnavang was their opposition 10 the consolidated strength of the republican 1 party, have at length adopted as their motto\n\n the maxim, \" divide and conquer\" The eX-\n\n istence of such grand division in the repub-\n\n !ican party as new nomination will ineyita- bly produce, will be hailed by tho ftderalists,\n\n as an event most suspicious to their purposes.\n\n A mighty and united effort will be made to\n\n regain their lost ascendancy, and let us not\n\n rest in mistaken security. The result of a re- cent election in sister state should warn us ! how much may he effected by secret intrigue; and how different the result of an election\n\n may be from the wishes and expectations of a maiority of the electors. But let us for\n\n moment enquire, what is the occasion which calls so loudly for d new nomination <? Is the\n\n system of nomination by a legislative caucus pernIcious in it's tendency? Is it dangerous to\n\n virtually entrust the whole appointing power\n\n with the legislature, because fits isinvesting them\n\n with too much power: and they may abuse it!\n\n But the question iss what evil hus been done,\n\n for the caucus can have no opportunity ofex- ercising their powers until after the next elee- tion. The argument then, that because fil-\n\n ture danger is to be apprehended from the nn- due powers of legislative caucus, therefore the nomination which such a. caucus has al- ready made and published cannot with safe\n\n ty be supported by the electors, wholly fails If the caucus have done right it is no objection\n\n to their doings, that at the time they did so.\n\n they had the power ofs doing wrong. The\n\n fact that governor is clothed with extensive powers does not imply that his subjects do\n\n not enjoy liberty, if they are secured against\n\n the improper exercise of those powers. An\n\n absolute monarchy would be the form of gov\n\n ernment best calculated to promote the hap PlnesS of the subject, and to secure his rights, if he might always have ruler in whom, should be united the attributes of wisdom, and goodness, commensurate in degree with his power. It is theimpossibillty of this, arising from the imperfectiOn Of human nature, WI hich\n\n renders popular form of government the\n\n most free. Since then all apprehension of future danger, from the undue powers of tt\n\n legislative caucus, held last spring, and then\n\n dissolved, and reduced to its elements, is me- cessarily precluded, let us enquire what have ] that caucus done? Will it he said that they\n\n have not nominated men of long tried attach ment to the republican cause ? men who have been often honoured by the support of the",
