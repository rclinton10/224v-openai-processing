Gates was\ntransferred from the office OF adjutant sen-\neral to the command of the Northern DEF\npartment, he was advanced to the very\nimportant situation of that of adjutant gem\neral of that department with the rank of COL\nonel.\n\n\nIn February, 1777, point of honour,\nrespecting the date of his commission, in\n\n\ndnced him to resign: and he quilted the\n\n\nmilitary life before he had completed his 81\nyear.\n\n\ni Ambitious Of fame, and mortified by the\nIimpossblity of connecting his name with the\ngreat events of the revolution in military\n\n\ncharacter, he resolved to cultivate his natu-\n\n\nraj taste for painting, and thus devote HIM\n\n\nself to the commemoration of those scenes\n\n\nin which he could no longer be an actor\n\n\nSoon feeling the disadvantages under which\nthe study of the fine arts must be pursued\n\n\nin this country, in which there was at that\n\n\ntime no living artist to give instruction, nor\n\n\nany models for imitation, he went to France\n\n\nin June, 1880, and thence soon found his way\n: with letter from DR.. Eranklin) to Mr..\n\n\nWest in London; by him he was received\n\n\nwith great kindness, and instructed for\nshort time with parental care. But this\n\n\ncourse was soon interrupted: the news OF\nthe death of Major Andre was received in\n\n\nLondon in November of this year, and the\n| young artist, who was known to have held\n| the same rank in the American army that\n\n\nAndre did in the British, was arrested on\nthe charge of high treason, committed to\n/ prison, and remained in close confinement\n, during months. Happily for him the tide\n! of war changed, and instead of being brought\nto trial, he was liberated in 1881, and return\ned to America.\n\n\ne Not deferred by this hazardous adventure,\n!, he, at the close of the contest, resumed his\n! favorite project, returned to London in jan\n!, uary, 1884; was again received with cordial\n: kindness by Mr.. West, and under his instruc-\ne ton resumed and pursued his studies with\n: unremitted assiduity.\na In 1886 he produced his two first paintings\nS Of American history-the death of General\ne Warren at Bunker's Hill, and the death Of\nj. Gen. Montgomery at Quebec. These pic\n\n\nlures were seen and admired in France\n:, Germany, and Prussia as we'll as in Eng\n! land, and afforded evidence of a rapidity OF\ne improvement unequalled by any other ex-\nt. ample Ito our knowledge) in the history OF\n: the arts. From these pictures copper plates\ne were engraved by eminent artists under his\nd direction and at his expense.\nd Having by these compositions proved him.\nit self to be equal to his meditated task, Col.\ne Trumbull proceeded to mature his plan of a\n}, series of pictures intended to commemorate\ne the principal events, civil and military, of\nj the American revolution, in which it was\nC his object to preserve portraits OF the most\n! distinguished men, and accurate details of\n:, the arms, dresses, costume, and manners OF\n: the times.\n\n\nt In forming this outline of his project, and\ne in the selection of his subjects, he was ia\n;, voured with the advice and assistance OF\ne those venerable patriots who have SO lately\ne gone to their reward, John Adams, then min\nIt lister of the u.
