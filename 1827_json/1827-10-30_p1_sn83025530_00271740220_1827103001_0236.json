A\ngood education accomplishes in the one case what\nthe chisel of skilfu artist performs in the other\nand by small acquaintance only with mankind, we\nare enabled to perceive the closeness of the ANA\nogy.\n\n\nIn whatever point of view we consider the human\nbeing--whether we regard his present comforts, his\nfuture prospects, the benefits to be derived from his\ncivil and social relations the exaation of his ma\nture, or his high destiny--we shall find that all is\nstaked on the Improvement Of his mind.\n! In whatever region Of the globe we discover him\nwhether roaming Indian in the West a wander\ning Arab in the East, shivering at the North, bask\ning in the South or an inhabltant of the favor\ned climes Of Europe--void of intellectual improve\nrnent he is still, wherever located, savage crea\n| ture surrounded by wants and wretchedness, or\nplum sed into excesses IN his pleasures low and\nsensual fierce in his desires, cruel in his resent\nments. Destitute, in this state, of capacity for ra-\ntona government, he either lives in anarchy, or\ncrouches to a despot Ignorant or regardless OF\nhis moral and religious duties, the victim OF impos-\nture, or the slave OF superstition.\n\n\nBut happily for race, there is another side to\nthis picture, where the barren waste trans\nformed into paradise, with the stree of life,o\ndfIusing its benecent influence through every COM\npartment For man. enlightened by the rays OF\nscience, and Improved by intellectual exercise dis\nplays an almost nexhaustible fund of resources, in\nsubdung obstacles to supply his wants, and to null\ntiply his comforts and his advantages.

President.\nFELLOW CITIZENS:\n\n\nIn discharge of the duties of my appointment,\nproceed to give an imperfect sketch Of some of the\nobjects embraced by our Association.\n\n\nMan, destitute of mental cultivation, has been\naptly compared TO block of MARBLE in the state in\nwhich we find it when taken from the quarry. A\ngood education accomplishes in the one case what\nthe chisel of skilfu artist performs in the other\nand by small acquaintance only with mankind, we\nare enabled to perceive the closeness of the ANA\nogy.\n\n\nIn whatever point of view we consider the human\nbeing--whether we regard his present comforts, his\nfuture prospects, the benefits to be derived from his\ncivil and social relations the exaation of his ma\nture, or his high destiny--we shall find that all is\nstaked on the Improvement Of his mind.\n! In whatever region Of the globe we discover him\nwhether roaming Indian in the West a wander\ning Arab in the East, shivering at the North, bask\ning in the South or an inhabltant of the favor\ned climes Of Europe--void of intellectual improve\nrnent he is still, wherever located, savage crea\n| ture surrounded by wants and wretchedness, or\nplum sed into excesses IN his pleasures low and\nsensual fierce in his desires, cruel in his resent\nments. Destitute, in this state, of capacity for ra-\ntona government, he either lives in anarchy, or\ncrouches to a despot Ignorant or regardless OF\nhis moral and religious duties, the victim OF impos-\nture, or the slave OF superstition.\n\n\nBut happily for race, there is another side to\nthis picture, where the barren waste trans\nformed into paradise, with the stree of life,o\ndfIusing its benecent influence through every COM\npartment For man. enlightened by the rays OF\nscience, and Improved by intellectual exercise dis\nplays an almost nexhaustible fund of resources, in\nsubdung obstacles to supply his wants, and to null\ntiply his comforts and his advantages. But 1t is\nwhen he adds VIRTUE to knowledge, that he as\nIL of bic caIo harp nre-\nsents himself to us a finished character; and it is\n, when we view him in this position, that we can\nadopt the language of the Psamist :-s' Thou hast\nmade him little lower than the angels, and hast\ncrowned him with glory and honour!''\n\n\nTo reach this exalted point on the scale of Great\ned beings ought to be the primary object of each\n: individual and this Academy, being organized fol\n\n\nthe purpose of lultivang the NATURAL SCIENCES, as\n\n\none of the means OF attaining this elevation cheer\nIl fully embrace the present opportunity to inquire\nu briefly, how far they may be made subservent te\n. the noble design.\n\n\nThe natural sciences include within their exten\n\n\nsye range vast number and variety of objects\n+e eyery thing in short on this globe, and within it\n\n\nboth animate and inanimate. Hence, wherever the\n\n\neve turns or the foot treads, subjects intrude upor\n\n\nus, exciting attention, or inviting our inquiry\n\n\nIn order to distinguish one thing from another, ant\nfacilitate the acquisition of knowledge, naturalist\n\n\n\n\n\n~ ~ tenl-to divide sub-divide arrange, and form nom\n- enclatures and whatever cavillers may say upo\nGO this subject the immense number and variety OF oh\n\n\niects, their equally various relations, with their s.\n\n\nmltudes--all point out the necessity OF systemati\n\n\narrangement science destitute of this would be\nchaos, without form and void\" But whilst &c\n\n\nyocating the necessity of systems, it ought not to\n\n\nforgotten that to know the name OF thing merel.\n\n\nalthough essential to science, is scarcely, of itsel\nCdi yVo tho Ot animals. plant\n- and minerals; we may even acquire several ia\nPs' puanes and have as many names for each article\n~ but if we remain ignorant ofthelr natures and use\n'I' all our knowledge is little better than learned Ign\ne. rance and, although DEPRESSION, may be alo'\ned the remark that present modes OF educatio\n~ are too much limited to this kind OF learning, a.\n\n\nthat after having passed through what is dgnhed WI\n, the name of finished education if we stop here\nwe do not observe, read, and Think for ourselve\n10 we shall be found almost destitute OF real kno'\n-, ledge We have only been putt possession OF Y\n\n\ntools with which to acquire and IT we do not hand\nthem they will rust our hands, and our hnsh\n'z education will prove but of little benefit, either\ngo 80 ourselves or the world.\n~ ~ The NATURAL SCIENCES, or those embraced\n- our institution, arranged under the three gre\nw W heads denominaed the ANIMAL, the VEGETABLE, a\nI' the MINERAL kingdoms.
