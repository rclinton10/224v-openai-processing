Harker\nand his party which he is pleased to serve. Where\nis the man who is afraid to trust the principles and\nforms Of our Constitution? 1t has served US faith\nfully and advantageously for many years, and we\nshould not break it to pieces heap abuse upon it\nunadvisedly. / must acknowledge the present\nmode of electing the President and Vice President\nOf the United States is, in my opinion, liable to\nsome objections; but still, in the late election Of\nJ. Q. Adams, the Representatives Of the People\nacted constitutionally and honestly. | think the\nRepresentative should speak the voice Of his Con-\nstituents; and if Representative had consulted\nhis, the cote Of Delaware aCould not haze been\nTHROWN AWAY. But is it any objection to Pre-\nsilent that he has been constitutionally elected ?\n1t may dsqualify man, it may shake his integrity\nand dull his intellect, in Mr..

Harker has many queer notions,\nand this is one Of them, that Mr. Adams should\nnot be elected to the next Presidency, because he\nwas chosen in the manner prescribed BY the Con-\nstitution.\n\n\nBut Mr.. Harker's reasons why Federaists should\nvote for Jackson should be powerful stimuli in\nDemocrats to oppose him. Jackson's policy, says\nMr.. Harker, is to give the Federalists distinction\nand efficiency in the government she is to be the\npatron of that party who threw obstacles in the\nway Of !. the second war of independence, ,\"-he\nis to befriend those traitors Of their land who\nwould have sacrificed US to the oppression of Bri-\ntain sin word Federalism and its friends are to\n|be fostered under his paternal care, and in time\nregain that destructive strength which once made\nthem as terrific as they are now weak. If Democ-\nracy is worth preserving, all its friends should\nunite in giving their suffrages to its firm and able\nfriend and advocate. John Q. Adams has been\nacknowledged by Federalists as their most vio-\nlent opposershe has done bis country invaluable\nservice in assisting to crush the destroyer of Re-\npublican Liberty-and should ever be remembered\nwith gratitude by the Democratic party for the SER\nvices he has rendered their party, and the wisdom\n\n\nwith which he has guided the councils Of his coun-\ntry.

Harker\nand his party which he is pleased to serve. Where\nis the man who is afraid to trust the principles and\nforms Of our Constitution? 1t has served US faith\nfully and advantageously for many years, and we\nshould not break it to pieces heap abuse upon it\nunadvisedly. / must acknowledge the present\nmode of electing the President and Vice President\nOf the United States is, in my opinion, liable to\nsome objections; but still, in the late election Of\nJ.

Harker has many queer notions,\nand this is one Of them, that Mr. Adams should\nnot be elected to the next Presidency, because he\nwas chosen in the manner prescribed BY the Con-\nstitution.\n\n\nBut Mr.. Harker's reasons why Federaists should\nvote for Jackson should be powerful stimuli in\nDemocrats to oppose him. Jackson's policy, says\nMr.. Harker, is to give the Federalists distinction\nand efficiency in the government she is to be the\npatron of that party who threw obstacles in the\nway Of !. the second war of independence, ,\"-he\nis to befriend those traitors Of their land who\nwould have sacrificed US to the oppression of Bri-\ntain sin word Federalism and its friends are to\n|be fostered under his paternal care, and in time\nregain that destructive strength which once made\nthem as terrific as they are now weak. If Democ-\nracy is worth preserving, all its friends should\nunite in giving their suffrages to its firm and able\nfriend and advocate. John Q. Adams has been\nacknowledged by Federalists as their most vio-\nlent opposershe has done bis country invaluable\nservice in assisting to crush the destroyer of Re-\npublican Liberty-and should ever be remembered\nwith gratitude by the Democratic party for the SER\nvices he has rendered their party, and the wisdom\n\n\nwith which he has guided the councils Of his coun-\ntry.
