After Brest it\nis the largest naval depot in France, and is\nindeed ast and magnificent establishment.\nNature tas already done much in forming\none of the finest harbors in the Mediterrane-\nan, and the ambition of Louis 14th and of\nNapoleon has not failed to add every thing\nthat art could DO TO render those natural adj\nvautages as eIfcctual as possible. Almost\nevery thing necessary in the equipment of\nships OF war, and which is required for the\nexpenditure of the Arsenal is manufactured\nin the establishment itself, such as canvass,\ncordage, iron work and the like. These\nmanufactures and the other work OF the\nyard OF course require an immense deal OF\nlabour, which is performed by about four\nhundred galley slaves or convicts, under the\nsuperintendent of large number keep\n4 ers. In France, the system OF criminal u-\n! risprudence is very mild and rarely involves\nthe punishment of death; but for great oifenc\n\n\nes, the criminals are sentenced to hard labor\nfor life. or for shorter periods, according to\nthe degree of their criminality. In order to\nemploy the large number of criminals which\nthe numerous and dense population ofthis\ncountry naturally affords, they send then to\ntheir different naval arsenals where they are\nfed on a healthy vegetable diet, and are kept\nconstantly well employ ed.

A.\n\n\nA few minutes before nine O'Clock yester-\nday morning, an alarming Fire broke out III\nthe town of Alexandria. 1t was soon per\nceived from this city; and, colG as the\nweather was, (thcrmometer at lo') our\ntownsmen turned out With alacrity and al\nmost literally flew to the assistance OF 'nei,\nneighbours. The Engine from the Capitoi\nHill, with its hose was under way IN rev\nminutes after the fire was dlscovered.--A\nbout three hundred persons from the Navy\nYard, headed by Captain Booth, were uh-\nder way almost as soon, but having lurtner\nto 60 did not arrive quite as early on .ie\nground. The Engine from the Post Ol1lcc\nDepartment, with its fine hose got under\nway as soon as the fire was ascertalhea 10\nbe serious, and had just started when an eX-\nnress arrived to our Mayor from the Mayor\nof Alexandria, soliciting aid, upon which\nthe Engine of e Second ward, and that\nfrom the First were notified, and were un~\nder way. Nor were our Georgetown neigh\nbors behind hand: with great SPIRIT they\nwent down in numbers IN carriages, on\nhorseback, and on foot, carrying also, 1t IS\nbelieved, their engine. All the Marines on\nthe station, were also carried down oy Gap\ntain IIowle, under the orders OF Col. lien\nderson and carrying an engine with them;\nand though they did not arrive until the iife\nwas got under, afforded important service\nas guards. The whole number OF persons\nwho went down from this SIDE OF the river\ncould not be less than thousand.

In France, the system OF criminal u-\n! risprudence is very mild and rarely involves\nthe punishment of death; but for great oifenc\n\n\nes, the criminals are sentenced to hard labor\nfor life. or for shorter periods, according to\nthe degree of their criminality.

A.\n\n\nA few minutes before nine O'Clock yester-\nday morning, an alarming Fire broke out III\nthe town of Alexandria. 1t was soon per\nceived from this city; and, colG as the\nweather was, (thcrmometer at lo') our\ntownsmen turned out With alacrity and al\nmost literally flew to the assistance OF 'nei,\nneighbours. The Engine from the Capitoi\nHill, with its hose was under way IN rev\nminutes after the fire was dlscovered.--A\nbout three hundred persons from the Navy\nYard, headed by Captain Booth, were uh-\nder way almost as soon, but having lurtner\nto 60 did not arrive quite as early on .ie\nground.

Nor were our Georgetown neigh\nbors behind hand: with great SPIRIT they\nwent down in numbers IN carriages, on\nhorseback, and on foot, carrying also, 1t IS\nbelieved, their engine. All the Marines on\nthe station, were also carried down oy Gap\ntain IIowle, under the orders OF Col. lien\nderson and carrying an engine with them;\nand though they did not arrive until the iife\nwas got under, afforded important service\nas guards.
