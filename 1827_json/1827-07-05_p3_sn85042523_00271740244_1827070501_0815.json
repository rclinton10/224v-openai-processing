Rowland was appointed Sec\nretary.\n\n\nThe following resolutions were then adopt\ned,\n\n\n| Reso{ued, That the protection of Ameri-\ncan manufactures, by a judicious tariff is, in\nthe opinion Of this meeting, the true and OBJ\nrious policy of this nation; that the truth Of\nthis proposition is every day demonstrated\nby the tlourIshing condition of every portion\nof our country where manufacturing estab-\nlishments are in successful progressna con-\ndition not confined to the manufacturer him\nself, but participated in by every other\nbranch OF industry within the sphere of its\ninfluence, and especially by the Farmer\nthus exhibiting the intimate union subsisting\nbetween the two great interests of agricul-\nture and manufactures; and that while we\ncordially approve ofthe policy, we entertain\nno doubht Of the constitutional power Of\nCongress to legislate upon subject, which\nwas deemed peculiar object OF their care\nby Washington, Jefferson, Madison and Mon\nroe; and upon which Congress has exercis\ned the right of legislation from the origin of\nthe government to the present day.\nReSoiUed, That we regard the doctrine\ncontained in the proceedings recently pro\nmulgated by the legislature of Virginia, de-\nnying to Congress any power whatever to\nprotect any domestic manufactures, as fall\nlacious and visionary in the extreme-as\n! contrary to the best interests and happiness\nOf the nation, as it is repugnant to the true\nintention and correct exposition of the in\nstrument it assumes to interpret-contra\ndicted by the concurring opinion OF the ia\ntheirs of the Constitution itself, OF Washing\nton. Hamilton, and Madison. and by the uni\nform practice Of every admiration which had\nacted under that Constitution.\n\n\nReselved, That we approve the bill which\npassed the House Of Representatives during\nthe last session of Congress, entitled \"An act\nfor the alteration Of the acts imposing duties\nON imposts.\" We regard it as measure pc\nculiarly calculated to promote the interest Of\nthe agrculturalist and the manufacturer, By\nthe protection it secured to the manu-\nfacturer OF coarse woollens and to the pro-\nduce of the raw material.\n\n\n1t protected the manufacturer, not by ma.\nterially increasing the duty, but by fixing\nthe value in such manner as to defeat the\nfrauds and evasons, by which the revenue\nhad been diminished and the manufacturer\noppressed.\n\n\n1t protected and encouraged the growth OF\nwool, by an increase of duty on the foreign\nmaterial so gradual as to keep pace with the\ngradual increase of the means of production\n\n\nRESOLVED. That this meeting cordially ac-\ncept the invitation Of the Pennsylvania So\nciety of Manufactures and the Mechanic\nArts, to appoint delegation to attend\ngeneral convention at Harrisburg on the 3oth\nday of July next, for the purpose of deliber-\nating on the measures proper to be taken in\nthe present \"depressed state of the wooden\nmanufacture and of the market for WOOL\"\nand such other manufactures as require le-\ngisative encouragement, and that HcnryM\nRidgley, Louis M'Lane,\" f. I. Dupont, las\nCandy, James r. Black, Doct. A Naudain,\nVIM. w.

Nodding plumes and glittering bayo.\nnets have been rare sights with us during\nthese piping times OF peace\" but when we\nhear the merry tap of the drum, the martial\nimpulse is irresistible. We thought the\nmartial spirit of our peaceable borough\nhad become extinct since the late war, as\none fourth Of July after another passed a\nway without the least display Of military pa\nrade; but in this we were mistaken. for the\nwild ambition of some Of our legislators,\nwho, painting for the glory of commanding\na batch of cornstalks and hoop-poles, induc-\ned them to pass military law, that the good\ncitizens of the state Of Delaware might be\ndragged indiscriminately, four times year,\ninto the field through dust and mud to wit\nness the admirable feats of their gallant Of\nflccrs. But to return to sketch Of the events\nof the day:\n\n\nWe suppose our readers at distance, and\nparticularly those who have been kept at\nhome BY the labours of the harvest field,\nwould like to know what kind Of day we\nhad.\n\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the two volunteer\ncompanies, State Fenei6ics and Washington\nGrays, commanded by Captains Porter and\nMClung, paraded in fine style and repaired\nto the Old Ferry, about half mile below\nthe borough to receive the Washington Fen\ncibirS, Capt. Cooper, from Philadelphia, who\nwere expected to join US in commemorating\nthe great day. The steamboat arrived about\n6 o'clock, and the troops expected, having\ndiscmbarked, were received by those in\nwaiting, and escorted up to town under the\ncommand of Major Woolfe. In the eyening\nour welcomed yisiters enjoyed pleasant ex-\ncurslon upon the romantic shores of the\nbrandy wine, the beauties of the scenery be !.\n\n\ning heightened by the ia! OF bright moon.\n\n\nOn the morning Of the 4th, about O'Clock,\nthe drums beat to arms. The respective\ncompanies met and repaired to shady\ngrove about a mile west of the town, where\nthey partook of plain but substantial colla-\nton. The Declaration of Independence was\nread and many patriotic toast drank, and\nhad it not been for two unpleasant circum-\nstances, the hilarities Of thl day would have\nended in most agreeable manner; one Of\nwhich was tremendous gust of rain, which\ncame upon the company about the time\nthey we're preparing to return to town,\nwhich drenched every mothers son of them\nto the very skin. and they, poor fellows. came\nhome in most unenviable predicament.\nThe other circumstance to which we alludc,\nnance. was ola most serious nature-and we arc\nnot certain that the result will not be the loss Of\nthe lives Of two of our citizens. These young\nmen were engaged with others in loading and fir\ning field piece which was used to respond the\nsentiments of the tousts which were drank, and\nwere in the act of ramming home heavy car.\nfridge, when the gun went off. The result may\nalmost Immediately be conceived. Roth per.\nsons were blown several feet from the mue-e OF\nthe gun and most prcadfuly mangled. One of\nthem, Mr.. w. Hyatt, had his right hand blown\noff and was otherways much injured in face and\nbody, by the powder, the oher, Tarrans Brady,\nwas more dangerously injured, having the from\ntai hone of his head shattered considerably; one\neve blown out, and his face and neck tlreadfuly\nmangletl-but little hopes are entertained of his\nrecovery The fractured part Of Mr.. Ilyatt's\narm was amputated, and hop are entertained\nthat he will do well.\n\n\nThis morning our Philadelphia friends were\nescorted to the steamboat Superior, On hoard of\nwhich they embarked to return to their native\ncity, bearing with them the warmest wishes Of\nour citizens, for safe passage. Capt. Cooper's\nCompany was composed Of fine looking young\nmen, handsomely uniformed and well discipln-\ned, and their department whilst with rs was\nsuch as to engage our warnest feelings of re-\nspect and admiration. Less cannot be said Of\nour own troops; young, vigorous and full Of mar.\ntial pride, they cndcavorcd to excel in this, to\nits admirers, fascinating sciences and so great is\ntheir improvement in.discipline, that one would\nsuppose they had been, instead of u few weeks\nrgidly drilled for years Their general appear\nance is highly creditable.",

Rowland was appointed Sec\nretary.\n\n\nThe following resolutions were then adopt\ned,\n\n\n| Reso{ued, That the protection of Ameri-\ncan manufactures, by a judicious tariff is, in\nthe opinion Of this meeting, the true and OBJ\nrious policy of this nation; that the truth Of\nthis proposition is every day demonstrated\nby the tlourIshing condition of every portion\nof our country where manufacturing estab-\nlishments are in successful progressna con-\ndition not confined to the manufacturer him\nself, but participated in by every other\nbranch OF industry within the sphere of its\ninfluence, and especially by the Farmer\nthus exhibiting the intimate union subsisting\nbetween the two great interests of agricul-\nture and manufactures; and that while we\ncordially approve ofthe policy, we entertain\nno doubht Of the constitutional power Of\nCongress to legislate upon subject, which\nwas deemed peculiar object OF their care\nby Washington, Jefferson, Madison and Mon\nroe; and upon which Congress has exercis\ned the right of legislation from the origin of\nthe government to the present day.\nReSoiUed, That we regard the doctrine\ncontained in the proceedings recently pro\nmulgated by the legislature of Virginia, de-\nnying to Congress any power whatever to\nprotect any domestic manufactures, as fall\nlacious and visionary in the extreme-as\n! contrary to the best interests and happiness\nOf the nation, as it is repugnant to the true\nintention and correct exposition of the in\nstrument it assumes to interpret-contra\ndicted by the concurring opinion OF the ia\ntheirs of the Constitution itself, OF Washing\nton. Hamilton, and Madison. and by the uni\nform practice Of every admiration which had\nacted under that Constitution.\n\n\nReselved, That we approve the bill which\npassed the House Of Representatives during\nthe last session of Congress, entitled \"An act\nfor the alteration Of the acts imposing duties\nON imposts.\" We regard it as measure pc\nculiarly calculated to promote the interest Of\nthe agrculturalist and the manufacturer, By\nthe protection it secured to the manu-\nfacturer OF coarse woollens and to the pro-\nduce of the raw material.\n\n\n1t protected the manufacturer, not by ma.\nterially increasing the duty, but by fixing\nthe value in such manner as to defeat the\nfrauds and evasons, by which the revenue\nhad been diminished and the manufacturer\noppressed.\n\n\n1t protected and encouraged the growth OF\nwool, by an increase of duty on the foreign\nmaterial so gradual as to keep pace with the\ngradual increase of the means of production\n\n\nRESOLVED.

Nodding plumes and glittering bayo.\nnets have been rare sights with us during\nthese piping times OF peace\" but when we\nhear the merry tap of the drum, the martial\nimpulse is irresistible. We thought the\nmartial spirit of our peaceable borough\nhad become extinct since the late war, as\none fourth Of July after another passed a\nway without the least display Of military pa\nrade; but in this we were mistaken. for the\nwild ambition of some Of our legislators,\nwho, painting for the glory of commanding\na batch of cornstalks and hoop-poles, induc-\ned them to pass military law, that the good\ncitizens of the state Of Delaware might be\ndragged indiscriminately, four times year,\ninto the field through dust and mud to wit\nness the admirable feats of their gallant Of\nflccrs. But to return to sketch Of the events\nof the day:\n\n\nWe suppose our readers at distance, and\nparticularly those who have been kept at\nhome BY the labours of the harvest field,\nwould like to know what kind Of day we\nhad.\n\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the two volunteer\ncompanies, State Fenei6ics and Washington\nGrays, commanded by Captains Porter and\nMClung, paraded in fine style and repaired\nto the Old Ferry, about half mile below\nthe borough to receive the Washington Fen\ncibirS, Capt. Cooper, from Philadelphia, who\nwere expected to join US in commemorating\nthe great day. The steamboat arrived about\n6 o'clock, and the troops expected, having\ndiscmbarked, were received by those in\nwaiting, and escorted up to town under the\ncommand of Major Woolfe. In the eyening\nour welcomed yisiters enjoyed pleasant ex-\ncurslon upon the romantic shores of the\nbrandy wine, the beauties of the scenery be !.\n\n\ning heightened by the ia! OF bright moon.\n\n\nOn the morning Of the 4th, about O'Clock,\nthe drums beat to arms. The respective\ncompanies met and repaired to shady\ngrove about a mile west of the town, where\nthey partook of plain but substantial colla-\nton. The Declaration of Independence was\nread and many patriotic toast drank, and\nhad it not been for two unpleasant circum-\nstances, the hilarities Of thl day would have\nended in most agreeable manner; one Of\nwhich was tremendous gust of rain, which\ncame upon the company about the time\nthey we're preparing to return to town,\nwhich drenched every mothers son of them\nto the very skin. and they, poor fellows. came\nhome in most unenviable predicament.\nThe other circumstance to which we alludc,\nnance. was ola most serious nature-and we arc\nnot certain that the result will not be the loss Of\nthe lives Of two of our citizens. These young\nmen were engaged with others in loading and fir\ning field piece which was used to respond the\nsentiments of the tousts which were drank, and\nwere in the act of ramming home heavy car.\nfridge, when the gun went off. The result may\nalmost Immediately be conceived. Roth per.\nsons were blown several feet from the mue-e OF\nthe gun and most prcadfuly mangled. One of\nthem, Mr.. w. Hyatt, had his right hand blown\noff and was otherways much injured in face and\nbody, by the powder, the oher, Tarrans Brady,\nwas more dangerously injured, having the from\ntai hone of his head shattered considerably; one\neve blown out, and his face and neck tlreadfuly\nmangletl-but little hopes are entertained of his\nrecovery The fractured part Of Mr.. Ilyatt's\narm was amputated, and hop are entertained\nthat he will do well.\n\n\nThis morning our Philadelphia friends were\nescorted to the steamboat Superior, On hoard of\nwhich they embarked to return to their native\ncity, bearing with them the warmest wishes Of\nour citizens, for safe passage. Capt. Cooper's\nCompany was composed Of fine looking young\nmen, handsomely uniformed and well discipln-\ned, and their department whilst with rs was\nsuch as to engage our warnest feelings of re-\nspect and admiration. Less cannot be said Of\nour own troops; young, vigorous and full Of mar.\ntial pride, they cndcavorcd to excel in this, to\nits admirers, fascinating sciences and so great is\ntheir improvement in.discipline, that one would\nsuppose they had been, instead of u few weeks\nrgidly drilled for years Their general appear\nance is highly creditable.",
