Thus it would not answer in\nany situation to sow exclusively autumn\ncrops, as wheat or rye; nor only spring crops,\nas oats or barley; for by so doing all the la\nbor of seed time would come ON at once, and\nthe same of harvest work, while the rest OF\nthe year there would be little to do on the\nfarm. But by sowing a portion OF each OF\nthese and OF er crops, the labor both OF seed\ntime and harvest is divided and rendered ca\nsier, and more likely to be done well ana IN\nseason. But this point is SO obvious as not\nto require elucidation.\n\n\nThe succession or rotation of crops, is\npoint on which the profits of the farmer de-\npend more than on any other. 1t is remark\ned by Arthur Young, that the agricultural\nwriter's, previously to the eighteenth centu-\nry, paid but little or no attention to it. They\nrecite, he says, courses good, bad. and exc\ncradle, in the same tone; as matters not open\nto praise or censure, and unconnccted with\nanv principles that could throw light on the\nArrangement of fields. The FIRST writer\nwho assigned due Importance to the subject\nOF rotations, seems to have been the Rev.\nAdam Dickinson, in his \"Treatise on Agri-\nculture\" published In Edinburgh, in 1777;\nand soon afterwards. Lord kaimes, in his\nGentleman Farmer illustrates the import\nance Of the subject; both writers were prob\nably led to it by observing the effects OF the\nNorfolk husbandry, then beginning to be IN\n1roduced to Berwckshire. But whatever\nmay have been the little attention paid to\nthis subject by former writer's, the import\nance of the subject of rotations, and the rule\nfounded on the principles already laid down,\nthat culmiferous crops ripenlnS their seeds\nshould not be repeated without the interven\ntion of pulse roots, herbage, or fallow, is\nnow Recognised in the practice and writings\nof all ludicious cultivators, more generally\nperhaps than any other\"\n\n\nEdit. of Farm. Nag.\n\n\nThe sy stem of rotations IS adopted ior G\nvery soil, though no one particular rotation\ncan be given for any one soil which will an\nswer in all cases, as something depends on\nclimate, and something also OH the kind OF\nproduce for which there is the greatest\nmarket demand. But wherever the system\nof rotations is followed, and the several pro-\ncesses of labor which belong to it properly\nexecuted, land will rarely get into foul and\nexhausted state; or, at least, if foul and ex\nhausted under judiclous rotation, \"matters\nwould be much worse was any other system\nfollowed\"\n\n\nThe particular crops which enter into a\nsystem of rotation must obviously be such as\nare suited to the soil and Climate, though,\nas the valuable author, so often quoted, OBJ\nserves, \"theY will be somewhat varied by\nlocal circumstances; such as the proximity\nof towns and villages, where there is great\ner demand for turnips, potatoes, hay, &c.\nthan in thinly peoped districts. In general,\nbeans and clover, with rye grass, are inter\nposed between corn crops on clayey soils\nand turnips, potatoes, and clover and rye\ngrass, on dry loans and sands, or what is\nTechnically known by the name of turnip\nsoils. A variety of other plants, such as\npeas, tares, and carrots, occupy part\nthough commonly but small part, of that\ndivision of a farm which is allotted to green\ncrops. This order of succession is called\nthe system of alternate husbandry and on\nrich soils, or such as have access to abundant\nOF putrrscent manure, 1t is certainly the\nmost productive of all others, both i'll food\nfor man and for the inferior animals. One\nhalf of farm is, in this course, always un-\nder some OF the different species Of cerea\ngramina, and the other half under pulse\nroots, cultivated heritage, or plain fallow.\n\n\nBut the greater part of the arabic land Of\nBritain, cannot be maintained in fertile\nstate under this management; and sandy\nsoils even though highly manured, soon be\ncome too incohesive under course of con\nslant tilage. 1t, therefore, becomes neces\nssry to leave that division or break that car\nries cultivated herbage, to be pastured fo\ntwo years or more, according to the degree\nof its consistency and fertility; and all th\nfields of the farm are treated thus in thei\nturn, if they require it. This is called TIL\nsystem of convertible husbandry, a regula\nchange being constantly going on from ara\ntion to pasturage, and Uice Versa.\n\n\nNot to repeat the same kind of crop at to\nshort intervals is another rule with regar\n20 the succession of crops. Whatever ma\nbe the cause, whether it is to be sought to\nin the nature of the soil, or OF the plant\nshemselves, experience clearly proves tn\nadvantages of introducing diversity OF spt\ncies into every course of cropping. Whe\nagain under the plough, there may be LEI\nneed for adhering steadily to this rule; o'\nthe degeneracy of wheat and other cor\ncreps recurring upon the same land ever\nsecond year for long period, has been vel\ngenerally acknowledged. 1t is the same wit\n+ what are called green crops; beans and pea\npotatoes, turnips, and, in an especial mai\nrsd rloyer become oil Of theun tpur",

            "article": "\n\n\nThe kind of crops te be raised are deter\nmined in great measure by the climate,\nsoil, and demand; and the quantity OF each,\nby the value, demand, and the adjustment\nOf farm labor.\n\n\nIn the adjustment of farm labor, the great\nart is to divide it as equally as possible thro'-\nout the year. Thus it would not answer in\nany situation to sow exclusively autumn\ncrops, as wheat or rye; nor only spring crops,\nas oats or barley; for by so doing all the la\nbor of seed time would come ON at once, and\nthe same of harvest work, while the rest OF\nthe year there would be little to do on the\nfarm. But by sowing a portion OF each OF\nthese and OF er crops, the labor both OF seed\ntime and harvest is divided and rendered ca\nsier, and more likely to be done well ana IN\nseason. But this point is SO obvious as not\nto require elucidation.\n\n\nThe succession or rotation of crops, is\npoint on which the profits of the farmer de-\npend more than on any other. 1t is remark\ned by Arthur Young, that the agricultural\nwriter's, previously to the eighteenth centu-\nry, paid but little or no attention to it. They\nrecite, he says, courses good, bad. and exc\ncradle, in the same tone; as matters not open\nto praise or censure, and unconnccted with\nanv principles that could throw light on the\nArrangement of fields. The FIRST writer\nwho assigned due Importance to the subject\nOF rotations, seems to have been the Rev.\nAdam Dickinson, in his \"Treatise on Agri-\nculture\" published In Edinburgh, in 1777;\nand soon afterwards. Lord kaimes, in his\nGentleman Farmer illustrates the import\nance Of the subject; both writers were prob\nably led to it by observing the effects OF the\nNorfolk husbandry, then beginning to be IN\n1roduced to Berwckshire. But whatever\nmay have been the little attention paid to\nthis subject by former writer's, the import\nance of the subject of rotations, and the rule\nfounded on the principles already laid down,\nthat culmiferous crops ripenlnS their seeds\nshould not be repeated without the interven\ntion of pulse roots, herbage, or fallow, is\nnow Recognised in the practice and writings\nof all ludicious cultivators, more generally\nperhaps than any other\"\n\n\nEdit. of Farm. Nag.\n\n\nThe sy stem of rotations IS adopted ior G\nvery soil, though no one particular rotation\ncan be given for any one soil which will an\nswer in all cases, as something depends on\nclimate, and something also OH the kind OF\nproduce for which there is the greatest\nmarket demand. But wherever the system\nof rotations is followed, and the several pro-\ncesses of labor which belong to it properly\nexecuted, land will rarely get into foul and\nexhausted state; or, at least, if foul and ex\nhausted under judiclous rotation, \"matters\nwould be much worse was any other system\nfollowed\"\n\n\nThe particular crops which enter into a\nsystem of rotation must obviously be such as\nare suited to the soil and Climate, though,\nas the valuable author, so often quoted, OBJ\nserves, \"theY will be somewhat varied by\nlocal circumstances; such as the proximity\nof towns and villages, where there is great\ner demand for turnips, potatoes, hay, &c.\nthan in thinly peoped districts. In general,\nbeans and clover, with rye grass, are inter\nposed between corn crops on clayey soils\nand turnips, potatoes, and clover and rye\ngrass, on dry loans and sands, or what is\nTechnically known by the name of turnip\nsoils. A variety of other plants, such as\npeas, tares, and carrots, occupy part\nthough commonly but small part, of that\ndivision of a farm which is allotted to green\ncrops. This order of succession is called\nthe system of alternate husbandry and on\nrich soils, or such as have access to abundant\nOF putrrscent manure, 1t is certainly the\nmost productive of all others, both i'll food\nfor man and for the inferior animals. One\nhalf of farm is, in this course, always un-\nder some OF the different species Of cerea\ngramina, and the other half under pulse\nroots, cultivated heritage, or plain fallow.\n\n\nBut the greater part of the arabic land Of\nBritain, cannot be maintained in fertile\nstate under this management; and sandy\nsoils even though highly manured, soon be\ncome too incohesive under course of con\nslant tilage. 1t, therefore, becomes neces\nssry to leave that division or break that car\nries cultivated herbage, to be pastured fo\ntwo years or more, according to the degree\nof its consistency and fertility; and all th\nfields of the farm are treated thus in thei\nturn, if they require it. This is called TIL\nsystem of convertible husbandry, a regula\nchange being constantly going on from ara\ntion to pasturage, and Uice Versa.\n\n\nNot to repeat the same kind of crop at to\nshort intervals is another rule with regar\n20 the succession of crops. Whatever ma\nbe the cause, whether it is to be sought to\nin the nature of the soil, or OF the plant\nshemselves, experience clearly proves tn\nadvantages of introducing diversity OF spt\ncies into every course of cropping. Whe\nagain under the plough, there may be LEI\nneed for adhering steadily to this rule; o'\nthe degeneracy of wheat and other cor\ncreps recurring upon the same land ever\nsecond year for long period, has been vel\ngenerally acknowledged. 1t is the same wit\n+ what are called green crops; beans and pea\npotatoes, turnips, and, in an especial mai\nrsd rloyer become oil Of theun tpur",
