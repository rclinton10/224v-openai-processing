P. Brobson, Rch-\nard Mansfield, Charles j Du Pont, and Isaac w.\nGibbs, were appointed. The said committee\nafter being some time absent, returned with the\nfollowing t-whichTafter being read by par\nagraphs, and considered, was unanimously adopt\ned\n\n\nThe Committee appointed by this meeting,.\nreport for adoption, the following preamble and\nresolutons:-1he great importance OF the inter-\nests of Agriculture and Manufactures, to the in.\ndependence and prosperity of the United Statess\nis too obvious to require proof they must be ad.\nmitted to be essential to our happiness in time of\npeace, and to our safety and glory, in.war. The\nemployment of our own in preference to foreign\nlabor; the creation of an home market for the\nproducts of every branch of our Domestic Indus\ntry, thereby quickening the energies of Agri-\nculture and Commerce; and the liberal protec.\n~\neign competition, should be among the primary\nduties of the government of the Union. The\nCommittee consider these Objects like those OF\nthe army and navy, of internal improvements\nand the general system of national defence, to\nbe cardinal objects in the policy Of the General\nGovernment, to be dealt with, and fostered,\nand promoted under its auspices, according to\nthe means and exigencies of the Country.\n\n\nThe progress of these great interests in the\nIT.,tz =. al. 1o14\nthe general prosperity which has uniformly fol.\nlowed in their track, show that they are already\nunder the sound action of public sentiment, and\nhave taken too deep root in the interests and at\nfections of the people, to be easily destroyed.\n\n\nThe Committee, therefore, recommend the\nadoption of the following resolutions:\n\n\nl. Resolved, That the employment of our\nown III preference to foreign labor; the protec-\nton of the labor of our own citizens against for.\neign labor and foreign competition; and the cre-\nalton Of home market for the products of every\nbranch Of our domestic industry, are primary OBJ\n.iects Of every good government, and in pecu\n| liar manner of that of the United States.\n| g. ReSoiped, That the protection of Ameri-\n\n\ncan Manufactures is, in the opinion of this meet\n\n\ning, the true and honest policy of this nation,\nthat the truth of this proposition is every day\ndemonstrated, by the Aourishing condition of\nevery potion of our country where manufactur-\ning establishments are in successful progress\na condition not confined to the manufacturer\nhimself, but participated in by every other\nbranch of industry within the sphere of its inhu-\nence, and especially by the farmer, thus exhib.\nitnE the intimate Union subsistng between the\ntwo great interests of Agriculture and Manufac-\ntures; and that while we cordially approve Of the\npolicy, we entertain no doubt of the constitu-\ntonal power of Congress to legslate upon a\nsubject which was deemed peculiar object of\ntheir care by Washington, Jefferson, Madison and\nMonroe, and upon which congress has exercis\ned the right of legislation from the origin of the\ngovernment to the present day.\n\n\n3. Res0irea, That we regard the doctrine\ncontained in the proceedings recently promul.\ngated by the Legislature Of Virginia, denying to\ncongress ''any power whatever to protect do\nmestic manufactures\" as faacious and visiona,\nry in the extreme-as contrary to the best inter\nests and happiness of this nations as it is repug-\nnant to the true intention and correct exposition\nof the instrument which it assumes to interpret\n-contradictcd by the concurring opinions of the\nfathers of the Constitution itself Washington,\nHamilton and Madison, and by the uniform prac-\ntice Of every administration which has acted un-\nder that constitution.\n\n\n/ 4. ReS0Iped, That whatever differences Of\nopinion may exist as TO some Of the provisions of\nthe bill which passed the house of representa-.\ntives during the last session of Congress, entitled\nsan act for the alteration of the acts imposing\nduties on imports\" we regard the general prn-\nciple Of support to so important branch ofman-\nufacture as that of wooen, as measure pecu-\nlarly calculated to promot. the interests of the\nagrculturist and the manufacturer, by the pro-\nlection it secured to the manufacturer of coarse\nwoollens, and to the produce of the raw material.\n\n\nS. Resolred, That this meeting cordially ac-\ncept the invitation of the Pennsylvania Society\n! Of Manufactures and the Mechanic Arts, to ap-\npoint delegation to attend ebe General Con-\nyenton at Harrisburg, on the 30th inst. for the\npurpose of delberatng on the measures proper\nto be taken in the present depressed state of\nthe woollen manufacture and the market for\nwool, and such other manufactures as require\nLegislative encouragement-and that William\nCooch, +. |. du Pont; James Candy, DR.. Arnold\nNautlain, Andrew Gray, VIM. w. Young, John\nHiggins, James Riddle, Philip Reybold, Jona-\nthan Jenkins, Spencer Williams, Kendall Batson,\nand VIM. d.

Hesolued, That the aforesaid delegates\n\n\nhave power to supply any vacancy which may\n\n\noccur in their number.\n\n\n| z. Resolred, That the Secretary be request\n\n\ned to give notice to the respective delegates,\n\n\nof their appointment; and also, to furnish the\n\n\nchairman of the delegation with an authenticat-\n\n\ned copy Of these proceedings.\n\n\ng.

ReSoiped, That the protection of Ameri-\n\n\ncan Manufactures is, in the opinion of this meet\n\n\ning, the true and honest policy of this nation,\nthat the truth of this proposition is every day\ndemonstrated, by the Aourishing condition of\nevery potion of our country where manufactur-\ning establishments are in successful progress\na condition not confined to the manufacturer\nhimself, but participated in by every other\nbranch of industry within the sphere of its inhu-\nence, and especially by the farmer, thus exhib.\nitnE the intimate Union subsistng between the\ntwo great interests of Agriculture and Manufac-\ntures; and that while we cordially approve Of the\npolicy, we entertain no doubt of the constitu-\ntonal power of Congress to legslate upon a\nsubject which was deemed peculiar object of\ntheir care by Washington, Jefferson, Madison and\nMonroe, and upon which congress has exercis\ned the right of legislation from the origin of the\ngovernment to the present day.\n\n\n3. Res0irea, That we regard the doctrine\ncontained in the proceedings recently promul.\ngated by the Legislature Of Virginia, denying to\ncongress ''any power whatever to protect do\nmestic manufactures\" as faacious and visiona,\nry in the extreme-as contrary to the best inter\nests and happiness of this nations as it is repug-\nnant to the true intention and correct exposition\nof the instrument which it assumes to interpret\n-contradictcd by the concurring opinions of the\nfathers of the Constitution itself Washington,\nHamilton and Madison, and by the uniform prac-\ntice Of every administration which has acted un-\nder that constitution.\n\n\n/ 4. ReS0Iped, That whatever differences Of\nopinion may exist as TO some Of the provisions of\nthe bill which passed the house of representa-.\ntives during the last session of Congress, entitled\nsan act for the alteration of the acts imposing\nduties on imports\" we regard the general prn-\nciple Of support to so important branch ofman-\nufacture as that of wooen, as measure pecu-\nlarly calculated to promot. the interests of the\nagrculturist and the manufacturer, by the pro-\nlection it secured to the manufacturer of coarse\nwoollens, and to the produce of the raw material.\n\n\nS. Resolred, That this meeting cordially ac-\ncept the invitation of the Pennsylvania Society\n! Of Manufactures and the Mechanic Arts, to ap-\npoint delegation to attend ebe General Con-\nyenton at Harrisburg, on the 30th inst. for the\npurpose of delberatng on the measures proper\nto be taken in the present depressed state of\nthe woollen manufacture and the market for\nwool, and such other manufactures as require\nLegislative encouragement-and that William\nCooch, +. |. du Pont; James Candy, DR..

Hesolued, That the aforesaid delegates\n\n\nhave power to supply any vacancy which may\n\n\noccur in their number.\n\n\n| z. Resolred, That the Secretary be request\n\n\ned to give notice to the respective delegates,\n\n\nof their appointment; and also, to furnish the\n\n\nchairman of the delegation with an authenticat-\n\n\ned copy Of these proceedings.\n\n\ng.
