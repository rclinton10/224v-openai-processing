The probability is, that the British Agent has\nfound the government so completely abandoned to\nFrench influence, that nothing beneficial by way OF\ncommercial arrangement could be effected; and\nthat the continuance Of peace. order and security\nin the Island, was precarious. that it was not ad\nvisable for him to remain.
