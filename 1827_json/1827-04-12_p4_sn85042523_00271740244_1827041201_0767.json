Eesseudeu-It is curious, but not\nentirely novel case, that the discovery of the\neffect Of rird,ing fruit trees in forcing them\ninto early bearing has been recently claimed\nas a new achievement, fer an English,\nGerman. and French horticulturist. Yet\nin truth, it was as we'll known to the cele.\nbrated Button as to any modern cultivator\n\n\nHe was induced to make extensive expe-\nriments on the decoration of forest trees prior\nto their being felled, with view to ascer-\ntain the comparative strength and durabill-\nsy of timber cut with the bark on, and that\nfrom which the bark had been removed some\nyears previously to its being felled. lie\nfound the strength of the wood OF trees\nwhose bark had been previously removed\nyear or two before its being cut, much great\ner than that of trees felled with the bark on.\nAnd he found. moreover, that trees win\nlive from one to four years after the whole\nbark has been removed. He then tried\npirdkinr of fruit trees, and the following\nsketch from his works will show, that he,\nn completely and satisfactorily tested the\neffects of it, as any modern cultivator has\ndone. II have made, (says the Comte de\nBufon,) many experiments upon variety\nOf fruit trees. 1t is a certain or intAllible\nmode of Fastening the period Of bearing,-\nThey (the girdled trees) blossom sometimes\nthree weeks before others, and give earlier\nfruit, and equally good the first year. have\neven had fruit on pear tree from which\nhad removed not only the bark but all the\nSAT- svoed (alburnum) and these premature\nfruits were is good as those OF other trees.\nhave also removed the 7Yhoie bark from\ntop to bottom of large apple trees and vigo-\nrous plumb trees. This operation has de-\nstroyed, even after the first year, the small\nest of these trees, but the large ones have\nsometimes resisted the effects of this bark\ning for two or three years. They were COW\ncred earlier than other trees with prodi-\ngious quantity of flowers, but the fruit which\nsucceeded, never ripened, nor even attained\nany considerable size.\n\n\navailed myself (says Buffon) of the expe-\nrience, and of the knowledge, which these\nvarious trials afforded me to attempt to\nforce into fruit trees of vigorous growth\nwhich seemed to throw all their force\n\n\ninto the production of wood made my\nfirst experiment on ounce tree re-\nmoved the bark in a spiral form from tive\nbranches of this tree. These two branches\nalone gave fruit---the others remained bar\nrem. Instead of removing the bark, some\ntimes simply tied cord round a branch\nthe effect was the same, had the pleasure\nof gathering the fruits of trees which hat\nbeen long barren.\n\n\nIn what manner soever you interrupt ol\nintercept the sap, you are sure OF Fastening\nproduction of fruits, and especially of flow\ners.\"",

            "article": "Mr.. Eesseudeu-It is curious, but not\nentirely novel case, that the discovery of the\neffect Of rird,ing fruit trees in forcing them\ninto early bearing has been recently claimed\nas a new achievement, fer an English,\nGerman. and French horticulturist. Yet\nin truth, it was as we'll known to the cele.\nbrated Button as to any modern cultivator\n\n\nHe was induced to make extensive expe-\nriments on the decoration of forest trees prior\nto their being felled, with view to ascer-\ntain the comparative strength and durabill-\nsy of timber cut with the bark on, and that\nfrom which the bark had been removed some\nyears previously to its being felled. lie\nfound the strength of the wood OF trees\nwhose bark had been previously removed\nyear or two before its being cut, much great\ner than that of trees felled with the bark on.\nAnd he found. moreover, that trees win\nlive from one to four years after the whole\nbark has been removed. He then tried\npirdkinr of fruit trees, and the following\nsketch from his works will show, that he,\nn completely and satisfactorily tested the\neffects of it, as any modern cultivator has\ndone. II have made, (says the Comte de\nBufon,) many experiments upon variety\nOf fruit trees. 1t is a certain or intAllible\nmode of Fastening the period Of bearing,-\nThey (the girdled trees) blossom sometimes\nthree weeks before others, and give earlier\nfruit, and equally good the first year. have\neven had fruit on pear tree from which\nhad removed not only the bark but all the\nSAT- svoed (alburnum) and these premature\nfruits were is good as those OF other trees.\nhave also removed the 7Yhoie bark from\ntop to bottom of large apple trees and vigo-\nrous plumb trees. This operation has de-\nstroyed, even after the first year, the small\nest of these trees, but the large ones have\nsometimes resisted the effects of this bark\ning for two or three years. They were COW\ncred earlier than other trees with prodi-\ngious quantity of flowers, but the fruit which\nsucceeded, never ripened, nor even attained\nany considerable size.\n\n\navailed myself (says Buffon) of the expe-\nrience, and of the knowledge, which these\nvarious trials afforded me to attempt to\nforce into fruit trees of vigorous growth\nwhich seemed to throw all their force\n\n\ninto the production of wood made my\nfirst experiment on ounce tree re-\nmoved the bark in a spiral form from tive\nbranches of this tree. These two branches\nalone gave fruit---the others remained bar\nrem. Instead of removing the bark, some\ntimes simply tied cord round a branch\nthe effect was the same, had the pleasure\nof gathering the fruits of trees which hat\nbeen long barren.\n\n\nIn what manner soever you interrupt ol\nintercept the sap, you are sure OF Fastening\nproduction of fruits, and especially of flow\ners.\"",
