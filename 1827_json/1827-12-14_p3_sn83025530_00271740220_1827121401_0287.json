The history of our times af-\n\n\nfords ample proofs that expenses increase nearly\n\n\nin the ratio of means, Industry begets wealth,\nand wealth extravaganza. Our manufactures have\nenabled thousands to indulge in dress and food,\n\n\nwhich their former humble situation condition IN\n\n\nlife, precluded them from; and it is believed, that\n500 manufactures, in good employment buy more\n/. goods paving duties than 1000 agrcultursts Hence.\nalthough our inportations OF woolens and cotnns\nfrom Great Britain were eight millions less in 1876\n\n\nthan in 1925, yet revenue, from these and other\ncircumstances, was three millions dollars greater in\n:, 1926 than in 1925.\n\n\n: The Treasury Report, made by Mr..

The history of our times af-\n\n\nfords ample proofs that expenses increase nearly\n\n\nin the ratio of means, Industry begets wealth,\nand wealth extravaganza.
