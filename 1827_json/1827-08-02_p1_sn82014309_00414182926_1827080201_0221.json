He dragged her as far as the street, but he could not compel her to release her grasp, and as she was now reinforced. he was remanded to his dungeon.

The regi- meas were left without pay in consequence of the general breaking up of the Austrian f. nance; the public spirit was extingl'ished by the result of SO many unsuccessful wars Napoleon's genius seemed to have gained the final ascendency and the general feeling throughout the Continent was, that all efforts for independence were hopeless.\n\n But in the midst of this national despair, there were some gallant spirits left, as if to keep up the remembrance of the old national glory, and be ready for the time of retribu- ton. Among the disbanded troops was a regiment of sharp-shooters, chiefly raised a. mong the COrinthian Alps. They were or- dered home to their native place, and some French officers with a cOmmissary general, were sent to attend them to Laybach,and see l the measure completed. NF\n\n The country in the neighbourhood of Lay bach is remarkably hilly, and the regiment was compelled to scatter a good deal.

Indeed digging for mo- ney hid in the earth, is very common thing: and in this state it is even considered an hon. orable and profitable employment. We could name if we pleased at least five hundred re- spectable men, who do, in the simplicity and sicerity of their hearts, verily believed that immense treasures lay concealed upon our Green Mountains, many of whom have been industriOusly and perseyeringly engaged in digging it up. Some of them have succeed ed even beyond their expectations. One gen tleman in ParkerstOwn, on the summit of the mountain, after digging with unyielding con fidence and unahatiing diligence, for ten or twelve years, found sufficient quantity of money to build him cOmmodious house for his own convenience, and to fill it with com forts for the weary traveller. On stopping lately to refresh. we were delighted by the view of an Gnchor on the sign, emblemat- ical of his hope of success, while we left him industriously digging for more. Another gen tleman on Lake Champlain, we were credibly informed, has actually dug up the enormous sum of fifty thousand dollars :! The incred- ] ulOus and unbelieving may stare at this asser- tiOn, but it is nevertheless true and we do not hesitate to declare our belief that digging tor money is the most certain way of obtain ing it.--NIuch, however depends upon the skill , ful use of the genuine mineral rod.

Among others ] who made this attempt was Gen. Pomeroy, of Northampton, then in his roth year, who came down to the causeway, mounted on a borrowed horse. When he reached the spot, the whizzing of balls and grape-shot was heard, the ground was torn up, and the fences in all directions were torn into splinters: Gen. P. came to halt-and as some of those around\n\n him perhaps supposed, for the purpose of turning back. He however dismounted, gave the horse in charge of stander, observing, \"it is too valuable an animal to take into such fire, besides not being his own,\" shouldered his musket, and crossed the neck on foot.\"- Mr. Everett then proposed: \"The Yankee notion of a commanding officer-Prudent and brave; who knows when to spare the caval- ry, and when to push the infantry\" Cheers Bost. paper.\n\n Aualanche.-A gentleman of Fayston, in whose veracity the most implicit reliance can be placed, has obligingly furnished us with 1 the following account of an avalanche Ofearth",

In it's course it swept away every thing in its way overturning trees by the roots; divesting them of roots, branches and bark, often breaking them in short pieces. A number of rocks were moved to some dis tance, judged to weigh from Is to 20 tons.

Some of the trees are standing on their tops, and stripped of their bark, and branhces, and bro- ken into many pieces. The pile, in some pla- ces is ten feet high. Much of the timber is apparently buried severalfeet in the mud and sand. One large birch tree was broken of square. measuring 3 feet g inches where it was broken. One black ash was literally pounded into broom, whose brush is feet long. The whole distance of these ravages is mile and half, and the quanti.yof land metaphorsed into barren waste is 25 acres. The force of water must have been great, at which we cannot wonder when we con sider the probable depth of the water. In some places, from appearances, it must have been 30 feet high. Some of the trees on the sides of the channel were parked thirty or for ty feet high, and mud on them at that height. -[ Montpelier (Vt.) paper\n\n Miring SGlt with HGy.-An English agri- culturist gives the following interesting in- formation in answer to inquiries made of him, respecting his mixing salt with hay when get",

            "article": "After the battle of Austerlitz, the Austrian Army was virtually disbanded. The regi- meas were left without pay in consequence of the general breaking up of the Austrian f. nance; the public spirit was extingl'ished by the result of SO many unsuccessful wars Napoleon's genius seemed to have gained the final ascendency and the general feeling throughout the Continent was, that all efforts for independence were hopeless.\n\n But in the midst of this national despair, there were some gallant spirits left, as if to keep up the remembrance of the old national glory, and be ready for the time of retribu- ton. Among the disbanded troops was a regiment of sharp-shooters, chiefly raised a. mong the COrinthian Alps. They were or- dered home to their native place, and some French officers with a cOmmissary general, were sent to attend them to Laybach,and see l the measure completed.

Indeed digging for mo- ney hid in the earth, is very common thing: and in this state it is even considered an hon. orable and profitable employment. We could name if we pleased at least five hundred re- spectable men, who do, in the simplicity and sicerity of their hearts, verily believed that immense treasures lay concealed upon our Green Mountains, many of whom have been industriOusly and perseyeringly engaged in digging it up. Some of them have succeed ed even beyond their expectations. One gen tleman in ParkerstOwn, on the summit of the mountain, after digging with unyielding con fidence and unahatiing diligence, for ten or twelve years, found sufficient quantity of money to build him cOmmodious house for his own convenience, and to fill it with com forts for the weary traveller. On stopping lately to refresh. we were delighted by the view of an Gnchor on the sign, emblemat- ical of his hope of success, while we left him industriously digging for more. Another gen tleman on Lake Champlain, we were credibly informed, has actually dug up the enormous sum of fifty thousand dollars :! The incred- ] ulOus and unbelieving may stare at this asser- tiOn, but it is nevertheless true and we do not hesitate to declare our belief that digging tor money is the most certain way of obtain ing it.--NIuch, however depends upon the skill , ful use of the genuine mineral rod. Don't dag too deep, is an appropriate maxim with all those who are versed in the art. Woods l. ron Plough skillfully guided, is sure to break the enchantment, and turn up the glttering dust in every furrow. Countless treasures yet remain in the earth.

The following, which oc- cured at the late anniversary meeting of the ancient and honorable Artillery Company of Boston, beautifully illustrates the sober, hon. est, and solemn resolution which distinguished so many of our fathers in the days of deliver ance from the house of bondage. Mr. Everett\n\n having been called on to propose a sentiment. introduced one with the following explanation: :\" MT.

This was one of ttC GiHtk ClICutlSIdHCCS WHICH pTcNcuIcu tue effectual lre-enforcement during the day, the American troops on Bunker Hill. Several attempts, however, were made, and with suc- cess, by individuals and parties from the head quarters at Cambridge, to support the Amer\n\n ican force engaged on the Hill. Among others ] who made this attempt was Gen. Pomeroy, of Northampton, then in his roth year, who came down to the causeway, mounted on a borrowed horse. When he reached the spot, the whizzing of balls and grape-shot was heard, the ground was torn up, and the fences in all directions were torn into splinters: Gen. P. came to halt-and as some of those around\n\n him perhaps supposed, for the purpose of turning back. He however dismounted, gave the horse in charge of stander, observing, \"it is too valuable an animal to take into such fire, besides not being his own,\" shouldered his musket, and crossed the neck on foot.\"- Mr. Everett then proposed: \"The Yankee notion of a commanding officer-Prudent and brave; who knows when to spare the caval- ry, and when to push the infantry\" Cheers Bost. paper.\n\n Aualanche.-A gentleman of Fayston, in whose veracity the most implicit reliance can be placed, has obligingly furnished us with 1 the following account of an avalanche Ofearth",

In it's course it swept away every thing in its way overturning trees by the roots; divesting them of roots, branches and bark, often breaking them in short pieces. A number of rocks were moved to some dis tance, judged to weigh from Is to 20 tons. From where it entered Mill brook, its course was a northeriy direction 28O rOds-the nat ural course of the Brook which was small |; hut the channel cut by this freshet is now from to 10 rods wide: and on either side are large quantities of hoodwood. piled up in many places very high, and. from l5 to % rods of the lower part oft, it is blocked up a. cross the channel in every direction. Some of the trees are standing on their tops, and stripped of their bark, and branhces, and bro- ken into many pieces. The pile, in some pla- ces is ten feet high. Much of the timber is apparently buried severalfeet in the mud and sand. One large birch tree was broken of square. measuring 3 feet g inches where it was broken. One black ash was literally pounded into broom, whose brush is feet long. The whole distance of these ravages is mile and half, and the quanti.yof land metaphorsed into barren waste is 25 acres. The force of water must have been great, at which we cannot wonder when we con sider the probable depth of the water. In some places, from appearances, it must have been 30 feet high. Some of the trees on the sides of the channel were parked thirty or for ty feet high, and mud on them at that height. -[ Montpelier (Vt.) paper\n\n Miring SGlt with HGy.-An English agri- culturist gives the following interesting in- formation in answer to inquiries made of him, respecting his mixing salt with hay when get",
