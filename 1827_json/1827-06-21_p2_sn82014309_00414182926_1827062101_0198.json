Her navigation act and her manufacturing monopoly the great pedes- tas upon which is erected that colossus of power which bestrides the commercial world, and have furnished the resources and means of annoyance that have bed her to impose sub bjecton upon some nations, to excite fear in others, and jealousy in all. Whatever may be thought of the abstract policy of these great features of her system the present day, such has heretofore been regarded the practical ei'ect.- Other governments discerning this consequence, have gone work to initiate and counteract her policy.~ The extraordinary parsonage who ruled the desinles of France aud threatened those of the world, believed in the reality of these of British greatness and power. This is manifest from tbe whole history of his public fe and from the details of his conversations his dying hour. France, under her restoral mon- archy, adheres to the same system. She found her self entangled by one commercial treaty with Great Britain, and would not be allured into renovation of compact, by her regarded injurious in its opera ton.

In Germa- ny, Italy, Holland, and every other commercial Euro pean state duties, bounties, drawbacks and restrc tions are the order of the day. To none of these countries you export the domestic productions north of the plantation states except under caprlcous\n\n licences and veXatious regulations, which destroy the value of the trade. The British system in particular equivalent to total prohibition upon the products of this part of the country. The revised tariff will show that they will admit only what it is impossible for us to introduce in competition with their own produce and fabrics-whle they take nothing from lis, they to have enjoyed the prescrptive usage, (which many o our cit'z1 unwilling to counenance) of supplying us with all we want from hats to shoes, and of manufacturing for us all things down to hob- nail.\n\n Under these circumstances Mir. O. insisted that the great question to be settled complex problem of abstract political economy, but of practical expedi ency. We could not pause to inquire into the wis dom and policy of this universal system. We pelled to shape according to its bearng.- The all important question IS, what is the actual con- diton of the country? He would not look for swer from the economists or wise scholars of any school but to the plain good sense and sober under standing of every practical man. He would lay Smith and Say and Ricardo, and their friends and foes upon his shelf Europe will take almost nothing which your soil produces. Imports in the long run cannot exceed eXpoTts-eonsequenty the latter must declRe\n\n first in value by accumulation; then theywill diminish in quantity. There being no foreign market for the surplus produce the farmer will raise than is sufficient for his mere subsistence What thenl the manifest and rapid tendency of this condition of af fairs Without manufactures must come to want every thing, and pay for nothing. Thus commerce and agriculture must sink together like two fond sis ters in gradual dcclinc and be buried i'll the same grave.\n\n He said he aware of only one answer that could be given to this statement That might be by den- al of the assumption, that the capital released from the occupations of agriculture and commerce could find no other employment. It is of the axioms of the liberal school that capital cannot be annhlated, but will always find employment.

Whenever eXportaton is prevented by the of demand a. broad, if the capital be not employed in manufactures that portion o it, and that only, which foreign nations will receive will be drained off in exchange for for eign manufactures, until nothing remains to supply the means of remittance. In this state of things, domes- tic manufactures cannot struggle into existence. The will SOW without hope and reap without advantage.

We know it is strenuous y contended by certain Jackson prints, that the pres. ent administration is federal-tha is principally sup ported and sustained by federalsts sfthc o school. The proof of this assertion the bare ipse drit of those who make it. That the administration num- bers among its warmest supporters ,aany old school federaliss, cannot be tenied neither do wish to deny it. On the other hand, the majority of the lea ders of the Proposition\" are pursuing course in attempting to weaken the hands of Mir. Adams, il his present exalted station. They were found in the during the administration of fIcferson, and more especially when Madison filed thr chair of state. Then when the whole united energies of the country were wanted, in carrying just with one ofthe most powerful nations the earth these same men left efforts untred to weaken the hands of govern ment Now these individuals exalted to the high est pitch of political rectitude, by the whole posse of the opposition writers, while such men as dams, Clay,\n\n \n\n eralsts, enemies of their country, and unfit for any of fee ofhonor crnolument These men stood firm in the of their country during the darkest political times ofthc last twenty years. If such application of obsolete-poitical names be not ridiculous absurd ity, we know not what would constitute an nconss- tcncy.\n\n greater political parties swallow up the lcss, aa, if the present national parties made up of malgamaton of the old political parties, as they posi- lively are how is possible that the lines of demar- Ration between those old parties should be traced so as to render the application of either ofthe names by which they were known, to any or set men, of any benefit or injury We have no anxiety about the name by which we called. So long as we can not be accused of opposing of vital import ance to the prosperity of our country of advocating measures injurious the best interests of the people, it is of little importance to whether we are called federal or democrat. Show man who is friend to free and unbiased election of state ofcers,to a choice of the best men for ofice-who is an ardent supporter of the great American System' of protec ing and chershins domestic industry, of prosecuting Internal Improvements, and of bringing the whole sources of the country to bear upon the honour ard prosperity of his native land and we will point out this man patriot worthy of trust and confidence, whatever name certain political demagogues may choose to call him. Show us man who is labouring necessarily to destroy republican administration, and with it every vestge of that which enobleth us as nation,-thc prosecution of Internal Improvements, and the protection of Domestic Industry and we will look upon this person one whose principles are di- ametrcay opposed 10 the best interests of our coun> \", and at direct variance with the doctrines nculca- ted by Jefferson, however he may boast of his repub- ican rectude and thunder his anathemas against others.\n\n We have never advapced the idea that parties do not and ought not to exist in country. We have never said we should take middle ground between the parties which do exist, and which have been strengthening their lines the pastyear. We have how always sad and said it understandngly too that relative to the old party distinctions we should take neither side: that we should not attempt to fan tie expiring ombers of old political strife into fame- We have also said we should yield awarm and hearty support to present national administration solong as it pursued that upright and patriotic course which has thus far marked its way and also that we should oppose vigorously every upwarrantabe assumption of power either in national or state politicians How far we have adhered to this course our files will te Pursuing this has however subjected us to some nnimadverson and much anxiety.

On such, devoNed the arduous duty of discerning the circumstances linn iting the measures, selecting the and improving the seasons, for modifying, graduating and applying such principles to the actual circumstances and wants of the state.\n\n If then, said Mir.

Review the commercial codes of all nations with which the United States have foreign relations, and the truth of this statement is garng to be dened- Great Britain set the example. Her navigation act and her manufacturing monopoly the great pedes- tas upon which is erected that colossus of power which bestrides the commercial world, and have furnished the resources and means of annoyance that have bed her to impose sub bjecton upon some nations, to excite fear in others, and jealousy in all. Whatever may be thought of the abstract policy of these great features of her system the present day, such has heretofore been regarded the practical ei'ect.- Other governments discerning this consequence, have gone work to initiate and counteract her policy.~ The extraordinary parsonage who ruled the desinles of France aud threatened those of the world, believed in the reality of these of British greatness and power. This is manifest from tbe whole history of his public fe and from the details of his conversations his dying hour. France, under her restoral mon- archy, adheres to the same system. She found her self entangled by one commercial treaty with Great Britain, and would not be allured into renovation of compact, by her regarded injurious in its opera ton. Russia, also, for short period, manifested symptoms of good will the liberal school, but repented and returned to her old system. In Germa- ny, Italy, Holland, and every other commercial Euro pean state duties, bounties, drawbacks and restrc tions are the order of the day. To none of these countries you export the domestic productions north of the plantation states except under caprlcous\n\n licences and veXatious regulations, which destroy the value of the trade. The British system in particular equivalent to total prohibition upon the products of this part of the country. The revised tariff will show that they will admit only what it is impossible for us to introduce in competition with their own produce and fabrics-whle they take nothing from lis, they to have enjoyed the prescrptive usage, (which many o our cit'z1 unwilling to counenance) of supplying us with all we want from hats to shoes, and of manufacturing for us all things down to hob- nail.\n\n Under these circumstances Mir. O. insisted that the great question to be settled complex problem of abstract political economy, but of practical expedi ency. We could not pause to inquire into the wis dom and policy of this universal system. We pelled to shape according to its bearng.- The all important question IS, what is the actual con- diton of the country? He would not look for swer from the economists or wise scholars of any school but to the plain good sense and sober under standing of every practical man. He would lay Smith and Say and Ricardo, and their friends and foes upon his shelf Europe will take almost nothing which your soil produces. Imports in the long run cannot exceed eXpoTts-eonsequenty the latter must declRe\n\n first in value by accumulation; then theywill diminish in quantity. There being no foreign market for the surplus produce the farmer will raise than is sufficient for his mere subsistence What thenl the manifest and rapid tendency of this condition of af fairs Without manufactures must come to want every thing, and pay for nothing. Thus commerce and agriculture must sink together like two fond sis ters in gradual dcclinc and be buried i'll the same grave.\n\n He said he aware of only one answer that could be given to this statement That might be by den- al of the assumption, that the capital released from the occupations of agriculture and commerce could find no other employment. It is of the axioms of the liberal school that capital cannot be annhlated, but will always find employment. But with all his dispo- ston to bow to high authority, he must press the ques tion wherein it be employed unless sent abroad to add to the capital of foreign nationl There is faacy in this axiom in it's application to the of this coustry. and probably in its reference the state of the wor which is uo reproach to these elaborate writers not to have reseen. The ordinary relations of the nations of the world arc those Of war or 1u mors of war. Resides, in almost every nation, the dverstes of soil and climates, though considerable have much uniformity that their wants are more va riabe, and dependent foreign nations for occasion al supplies, and thus afford new openings for the en- ploymcnt of capital. In our country commerce has been limited principally to tue export;on of raw pro- duce, and to the importation of fabrics. Whenever eXportaton is prevented by the of demand a. broad, if the capital be not employed in manufactures that portion o it, and that only, which foreign nations will receive will be drained off in exchange for for eign manufactures, until nothing remains to supply the means of remittance. In this state of things, domes- tic manufactures cannot struggle into existence. The will SOW without hope and reap without advantage. If with this prospect in view, individuals could cheer\n\n their spirits with fantastic visions of future prosper y and grandurc-could console themselves with cas- ties in the air he enved the rose-coored tint oftheir magnatioDs, but was compelled by his temperament to look to the future through more solnbre medium.\n\n O. then innnired what rcmedv should ha or,,I",

This may appear bold undertaking and wild scheme, but let it be remem- bered that many years ago, Admiral Duckwortl, al- though having 10 contend against the skill of General Sebastiani, and a number of French Engineers and artillery oicefs, performed this feat, and why should not the hero ofthe Basque Roads, aided by the en- thusastc bravery of people struggling for liberty be able with his steam boats, to compass the same ends The shores of the Black Sea are rich fertile, and un- protected; they will afford rich harvest, yon may Cochrane\n\n LONDON, April 30.\n\n We have reteived this morning the Frankfort Jour\n\n \n\n Oriental Spectator, dated Smyrna, March 9, which describes the Greek Refugees at Naxos to have re- quilted the most generous hospitality with outrage which had compelled the inhabitants to call for the powerful interference of Admiral de Riquy in their behalf The Candiots prepared to attack the town, but 14 of the number being killed or wounded, they for that time iled and dispersed over the county- They subsequently committed great eXcesses.

It was however understood that the Brazians lost 200 men.\n\n private letter says\" This Government is about to send rcnorcements to their army and the Buenos Ayres commander, Gen. Alvear, has sent for 250O men, that the winter will probably pas away in preparations for an active campaign next summer while it is understood that negotiations going on through the medium of the British ministers at this Court and at Buenos Ayres. The possession of the Banda Oriental and Montevideo is the point on which the negotiations turn, and both parties are equally ob stinate the subject paciGcation be expected until the other is able to it. Peace is equally desirable to doth. Buenos Ayres has howev- er by the intrepdity and skill of Admiral Brown, gained advantages the which promise to give her the ascendary on that element, notwithstanding the great nominal superiority of this government.

A Christian observes the innocent civilities Of life, and is subject to human laws for conscience sake But a higher law is his rule of action {; one which takes cognizance of motive; one which reaches him in solitude and darkness; one which deals out to his neighbors as to himself; one which looks directly to the retributions of eternity.
