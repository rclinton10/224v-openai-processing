Pc\nter himself, though he possessed but COM\nparatively small portion of his mates volu-\nbility, was man of much courage, and\nwhile in the frequent rencontress between\nhimself and madame Keltzer, to which he\nwas subjected, he was uniformly obliged to\nbeat the retreat, he turned his back with an\nair of lortlly defiance, and his visage showed\nevident signs of threatening retaliation.\n\n\nBetween parties so often belligerent, it\nwas hardly to be expected that every con-\ntest should end in smoke. Peter complained\nto all his neighbors of his wife's reasonable\nwar upon his liberty, and accp>ed her with\ndesign of reducing him to downright slave\nry; while she was not less prompt in charg-\ning him with an idle rambling disposition,\nan entire neglect of all home AFFAIRS, and e.\nven with being guilty of amours with Some\nof her good neighbours wives-whom he had\noccasionally furnished with saddle OF ven.\nison or string of squirrels. AS the danes\nsuspicious seemed founded on this, the last\ncharge was probably untrue, but the others\nwere doubtless substantial, and incontroyert-\nible on either side.\n\n\nNo one who has seen any thing of the\n\n\nworld, need be told what kind OF advice the\nfriends Of our honest couple gave them on\nthese occasions, or that its tendency was not\n\n\nin the smallest degree of a conciatory kind;\n\n\ninstead of growing better, things grew evil\nIDENTIFY worse, and from oft repeated threats\non both Sides plans OF execution were re-\n\n\nsolved in the minds of both Peter and his\n\n\nwife.

He\nseriously believed Dame keltzer designed\npreparing dungeon in which to immure\nhim. soul and body, and thereby execute\nlong standing threat that she would break\nhis rambling.

The moment he set his\n\n\nfoot upon the threshold, she seized his arm,\n\n\nand made a desperate attempt to accomplish\n\n\nby force what she slespaired ever being a.\nbic to do by stratagcm. A doubtful strug-\n\n\ngle ensued and Peter partly disengaging him\nself, so that as he fell, he seized and drag\nged the good woman after him, and she\n\n\ncatching at the door to stay herself, prccip-\n\n\nitated it down over them both. The fan\n\n\ndid no injury. The dame in tenderness Tor\n\n\nher husband, had deposited a quantity OF\n\n\nfax which she had taken to spin, so that il\n\n\nreceived them both, and when they fairly\n\n\nrecovered themselves on their feet, they\nfound neither had sustained damage, alft\nboth were fairly vanquished.\n\n\n, At first they took separate corners of ths\ncell, avowing themselves quite conten.ce\nand comfortable.

They had dog which\nnow and then caught pig; and the eggs of\nthe albatross, which were stored at the prop\ner season, with potatoes, formed substitute\nfor bread; and the skins Of the seals for\nclothes. They built house OF stone, still\nremaining on the island, which was strong\nenough to withstand the storms of wiRter,\nand they might have been comparatively\nhappy, but that they were cut off from their\nrelations and friends, without any immediate\nprospect of being removed from the island.\n\n\nTo add to the misfortunes of Captain\nBarnard in being separated from his wife\nand children, his companions. over whom he\nexercised no authority. but merely dictated\nwhat he considered was for their mutual adj\nvantage, became impatient even of this\nmild controul, took an opportunity to steal\nthe boat, and he was left on the island alone.\nAfter being thus entirely abandoned, he\nspent the time in preparing clothes from\nthe skin of the seal, and in collecting food\ntor winter. Once or twice day he used to\nascend hill, from which there was wide\nprospect of the ocean, to see if any vessel\napproached, but always retired disappoint-\ned and forlorn--no ship was to be observed.\nThe four sailors, in the meanwhile, having\nexperienced their own inability to provide\nproperly for themselves, returned to him afs\nter an absence Of some months.\n\n\nHe still found some difficulty in preserv-\ning peace among his companions; indeed,\none of them had planned his death, but for\ntunately it was discovered in time to be pre-\nvented. He placed this man alone with some\nprovisions, ON small island in Quaker har-\nbour, and in the course of three weeks, so\ngreat change was made on his mind, that\nwhen Captain Barnard took him off, he was\nworn down with reflection on his crimes,\nand truly penitent.\n\n\nThey were now attentive to the advice Of\ntheir commander, and the above mentioned\noffender became truly religious and exem-\nplary in his behaviour. In this way they\ncontinued to live, occasionally visiting the\nneghboring island in search of provisions,\ntill the end of two years when they were TAX =\nen- off in the month of December, 1915, by\nan English whaler, bound for the Pacific.\nCaptain Barnard informed me, that British\nman of war had been sent expressly from\nRio Janeiro, to take them off, but by some\naccident the vessel. though at the islands.\ndid not fall IN with them.\n\n\nCaptain Weddell thus describes the PEN\ngums, which abound in great numbers in\nSouth Georgia, an island east of Cape Horn.\n\n\nNo land quadrupeds are found here; birds\nand amphibious animals are the only inhab-\ntants.

Pc\nter himself, though he possessed but COM\nparatively small portion of his mates volu-\nbility, was man of much courage, and\nwhile in the frequent rencontress between\nhimself and madame Keltzer, to which he\nwas subjected, he was uniformly obliged to\nbeat the retreat, he turned his back with an\nair of lortlly defiance, and his visage showed\nevident signs of threatening retaliation.\n\n\nBetween parties so often belligerent, it\nwas hardly to be expected that every con-\ntest should end in smoke. Peter complained\nto all his neighbors of his wife's reasonable\nwar upon his liberty, and accp>ed her with\ndesign of reducing him to downright slave\nry; while she was not less prompt in charg-\ning him with an idle rambling disposition,\nan entire neglect of all home AFFAIRS, and e.\nven with being guilty of amours with Some\nof her good neighbours wives-whom he had\noccasionally furnished with saddle OF ven.\nison or string of squirrels.

He\nseriously believed Dame keltzer designed\npreparing dungeon in which to immure\nhim. soul and body, and thereby execute\nlong standing threat that she would break\nhis rambling.

A doubtful strug-\n\n\ngle ensued and Peter partly disengaging him\nself, so that as he fell, he seized and drag\nged the good woman after him, and she\n\n\ncatching at the door to stay herself, prccip-\n\n\nitated it down over them both. The fan\n\n\ndid no injury. The dame in tenderness Tor\n\n\nher husband, had deposited a quantity OF\n\n\nfax which she had taken to spin, so that il\n\n\nreceived them both, and when they fairly\n\n\nrecovered themselves on their feet, they\nfound neither had sustained damage, alft\nboth were fairly vanquished.\n\n\n, At first they took separate corners of ths\ncell, avowing themselves quite conten.ce\nand comfortable.
