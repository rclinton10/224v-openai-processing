These bills were essentially\nthe same. That in the senate was explained in a\nsensible and able speech by Mr. Johnson, the Chair\nman of the Committee which had reported it. As\nfar as we could observe, the explanation was sat\nistactory and the bill generally approved by the\ncountry. When the discussion came on, however,\nMr.. Smith, Of Maryland, moved to strike out the\nwhole bill. This motion was supported by the\nvotes Of the Opposition, as any motion will be which\npromises to thwart or cmbarrass the measures of\nGovernment. The motion prevailed and the new\nbill, thus amended by Mr.. Smith. passed the SEN\nate, and sent to the House Representatives.\nTO large majority of that House, this bill\nacceptable; but the session was far advanced, and\nit thought extremely desirable that some act of\nlegislation should be adopted. The House, there\nfore, laid aside its own BILL took up that oithe SEN\nate, proposed an amendment, which was consider\ned as indispensable, and thus amended, passed the\nSenate bill. The Senate declined acceding to\nthis amendment: and. as the House adhered to it.\nthe Senate with the full concurrence Of Mr. Smith.\nchose rather to lose the bill altogether, than to a.\ngree to the amendment of the House. The bill,\ntherefore, was ultimately lost in the Senate.\n\n\nFrom publication of General Smith in Balti-\nmore paper, IL now appears, DIS We thinA. peyonu\ndoubt or contradiction, that he did not understand\nthe operation of his own measure. We have en-\ntertained, habitually, great respect for General\nSmith, as merchant of extensive information, and\nmember of Congress of high standing. We were\npleased at his recent eelection to the Senate 81\nconsidering him as gentleman whose feelings were\ncandid, if not friendly, towards the Administration.\nBut must be permitted to say, that, on the sub\nject of the Colonial trade, he has, as we think,\nsubjected himself to very heavy responsibility\nIF evil should ensue from what has been done, or\nfrom what the Executive Government, in the ex-\nisting state of law, may feel itself bound by indies\npensabe duty to do, it is not necessary for to say\nafter what we have here observed, what individual.\nin our humble judgment, will be answerable. more\nthan any other, for that evil.

A reward of one hundred\ndollars is offered by some individuals Of Batavia\n(among whose names are those of Sheriff Thomp-\nson, Surrogate Mix. &c.) for the discovery Of the\npersons who attempted the outrage. One of the\nBatavia papers has insinuated that this ncendiary\nbusiness was all sham--that Mler's office was\nsurrounded by houses of freemasons, which must\ninevitably have been burnt with the office. We\nthink it would have been singular if the masons\nhad burnt themselves up in their rage. But this\nis queer business, and it seems to be safest not\nto believe any thing.",

These bills were essentially\nthe same. That in the senate was explained in a\nsensible and able speech by Mr. Johnson, the Chair\nman of the Committee which had reported it. As\nfar as we could observe, the explanation was sat\nistactory and the bill generally approved by the\ncountry. When the discussion came on, however,\nMr.. Smith, Of Maryland, moved to strike out the\nwhole bill. This motion was supported by the\nvotes Of the Opposition, as any motion will be which\npromises to thwart or cmbarrass the measures of\nGovernment. The motion prevailed and the new\nbill, thus amended by Mr.. Smith. passed the SEN\nate, and sent to the House Representatives.\nTO large majority of that House, this bill\nacceptable; but the session was far advanced, and\nit thought extremely desirable that some act of\nlegislation should be adopted. The House, there\nfore, laid aside its own BILL took up that oithe SEN\nate, proposed an amendment, which was consider\ned as indispensable, and thus amended, passed the\nSenate bill. The Senate declined acceding to\nthis amendment: and. as the House adhered to it.\nthe Senate with the full concurrence Of Mr. Smith.\nchose rather to lose the bill altogether, than to a.\ngree to the amendment of the House. The bill,\ntherefore, was ultimately lost in the Senate.\n\n\nFrom publication of General Smith in Balti-\nmore paper, IL now appears, DIS We thinA. peyonu\ndoubt or contradiction, that he did not understand\nthe operation of his own measure. We have en-\ntertained, habitually, great respect for General\nSmith, as merchant of extensive information, and\nmember of Congress of high standing. We were\npleased at his recent eelection to the Senate 81\nconsidering him as gentleman whose feelings were\ncandid, if not friendly, towards the Administration.\nBut must be permitted to say, that, on the sub\nject of the Colonial trade, he has, as we think,\nsubjected himself to very heavy responsibility\nIF evil should ensue from what has been done, or\nfrom what the Executive Government, in the ex-\nisting state of law, may feel itself bound by indies\npensabe duty to do, it is not necessary for to say\nafter what we have here observed, what individual.\nin our humble judgment, will be answerable. more\nthan any other, for that evil.
