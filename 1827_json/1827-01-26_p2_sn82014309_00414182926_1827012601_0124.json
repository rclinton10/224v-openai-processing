In 1792, when the existing militia laws were enacted by Congress, it was suppo- sed necessary that all the able bodied white male citizens of the United Statcs,-certain classes and persons excepted, ,-between the ages of lo and 45, should be enrolled, in or der to raise a force sufficient to repel invasion and suppress insurrection. Since that time our population has been trebed; and conse quently the number of our militia is thre times as large as was then thought necessar, for the defence ofthe country; while the dan gers from insurrections and invasions arc moi as great as they then were. Hence the pre- sent militia laws, independent of the very de moralizing effect they exert upon community, operate as a heavy and worse than useless tax upon almost all classes in community. To remedy this evil, the following plan has been submitted by the board for the consideration of Congress. Whether it will be adopted at the present session. or whether any of its fea- lures will be altered, before such plan be- comes law, we are unable to learn from a. ny thing we have heard or seen upon the sub ject. The plan is incomparably better than the old regulation, and we sincerely hope that either this, oran improvement upon it will be adopted by Congress.\n\n \"l. It is recommended that there he ap- pointed one Adjutant General for Me Militia of the United States, to be attached to the War Department, but without rank.\n\n 9. That there be appointed, in each State, an Adjutant General of the Militia of the State, and one Quartermaster General of the Militia of the State; or, in time of peace, one officer, to be both Adjutant and Quartermas- ter General: such officer, or officers, to have, each, the rank of Brigadier General.\n\n 8. Itis recommended to exempt all persons, under the age of twenty -One years, in the scv- eral States, from service in the Militia of the { United States. 4. It is recommended that there be enroll 1 ed and organized, in each State, from the whole mass of able bodied white male citizens, resident therein, who are, or shall be, above the age of twentyOne years, and always ta- king the youngest above that age, at the rate of one brigade of Militia, organized as herein proposed, for every member of the House of Representatives of the United States to which the State may be entitled.\n\n 5: It isprOposed that every two brisadcs of Militia, so enrolled in the same State, shall constitute one division; and if there be an odd brigade in the State, above division, that such brigade be attached to some convenient division. at the discretion of the State; that every brigade shall consist of three regiments; every regiment of two battalions; every bat taiion of four troops, or companies and ev- ry troop, or company, of five sergeants, five cOrpOrals, two musicians, and sixty-four pri yates. Each State to have the right to de- signate regiments, battalions, troops, and com panies. as Cavalry, Artillery, Light Infantry, Infantry, and Rihemen, at its discretion; or, to accept as part ofaits quota as above, with out regard to the limitation as to the age of twenty-one years, uniformed volunteer corps Of either arm, if armed and equipped accord ing to designation, and organized as herein proposed.\n\n 6. It is proposed that each State, also, have the right to extend the number of privates, per troop and company, within the State, from the minimum, sixty -four, to any num- ber not exceeding one hundred.\n\n z. Privates in troops of cavalry, to be also designated troopers; and privates m compa. nies of artillery, mattresses; and light infantry and rifemen to be included in the general de examination of intantry.\n\n 6. Divisions, brigades, regiments, and bat talions, may consist of different arms, as cav airy, artillery, and infantry, as above; an, when several troops of cavalry, whether sin gle, or organized into regiments or battalions are united for parade, instruction, or service they will be subject to an organization, il part, peculiar to this arm; thus, two troop will constitute as quadron, two squadrons hat taIion, and, as in the other arms, tw battal ions regiment; but, on the accidental O temporary union of two or more squadr0ns without field officers of this arm, the com nander of the division or brigade, to which",

So long as the government shall pursue the course it has adopted, SD long shall we give it our\n\n feeble support, and no longer. But we have never been bought, never been G.Gliated, by Mir. Secretary Clay, as our good neighbour, the Times, broadly declares. It is really a. musng to read this oft repeated charge of the\n\n opposition presses, ,''against the papers which support the administration. It would not take great sum to buy the whole posse of the anti-administration presses but the na-\n\n tional treasury would hardly be sufficient to give cool hundred to each editor who is in\n\n favor of Mr. Adams and his cabinet. Talk of bought up and affiliated presses only\n\n supporting the administration Who provided\n\n funds to buy them, and how much was offer\n\n ed to you, MT. Editor of the Times, to join the clan Or was a greater sum offered, and accepted, to enlist you into the opposition Now We are not apt to be jealous; but real ly, this continual harping about ''bought\" presses supporting ?\" corrupt administra- tion,\" almost forces upon us the belief that you are judging others by yourself; and that you are principally vexed that the national purse is not in the hands of those who will pay the highest bribes. 7'ake particular notice we do not go as far as you have done, hy saying that such is the fact; we only hint at the possibility of the thing. This last charit- able remark of the Times, was elicited in con- sequence ofthe removal, by Mir. Clay, of the U. s. printing from the N. H. Patriot, and Eastern Argus, to two other papers in the same towns where those papers are printed.\n\n This act of MT. Clay is spoken of as an un-\n\n heardo act of arbitrary and tylannical pow CT. But who ever heard of man giving an appointment, which is purely and simply his gift, to most virulent enemy Is it indceda\n\n new thing that the printing of the U. s. laws is taken from,a political opponent and given to political friend! Was such thing never heard of before? How did MT. Hill get the appointment? How did the Secretary of\n\n State under Jefferson conduct this business\n\n Did he leave the printing with the presses appointed under Adams Administration !-\n\n How has similar business within few years,\n\n been transacted in this state Who had the\n\n state printing at Ncw-Haven last spring? Mir.\n\n Clay exercised no stretch of power,-he per\n\n formed no new act, in gi,n the appointment to friend rather than to a foe. The sum is HUI \"o' LII CoH'CuuiH6 tahout, -oulJ Sioo,-- and the principle certainly is not an evidence of corruption and bargain.-The article alIu- ded to, was published in the Timesof the 18th inst. As the editor appeared so sens tive upon the subject, and his indignation a. gainst man who dared to exercise his own right in making appointments, waxed so warm, we confidently hoped that in his pa per of. the 22d we should see an article whip ping the It. Governor, Senator Hill, Sc. for their interference with the appointment of a sheriff's deputy; but we looked for it in vain. This was indeed a corrupt act. Had the appointment of the deputy been in their gift, no man could have complained had they appointed Mir. Baldwin in lieu of MT. Winton but it was not in their gift. They had the effrontcry to call upon the sheriG,who receives his appointment partly from them, to turn put a faithful deputy--not because he is political opponent, but because he dared to oppose part of the previous caucus ticket.- This subject presents theme worthy your pen brother Wells-a subject near home-and one, whether before unheard-of, or common, Al AZ",

This storm was also attended with this peculiar circumstance-it was not preceded by any strong indications or progression in it's commencement, but the first blast of wind that struck the earth, and the snow that came with it, were as great as at any succeeding period of the storm. Snow fell Nov: 11th 1920, and very cold, which made good sleighing fora week.\" When speaking of our present severe winter, the a. bove \"reminiscences are rendered somewhat in teresting. The last Vt. papers say that the snow on the west side of the mountain is about four feet deep upon level-that barns, sheds, and other OUt-buildings, were much injured by the weight of snow upon them, and many of them were crushed to the ground. $500 it is said will not repair the damage done in this way to the iron works in Fair Haven, Vt In Albany the snow is about three feet deer, accompanied by uncommon severity of cold.

We will here remark, although it may be contro- verted by some, that Litchfeld Hill is indeed not generally as cold here as at Albany, or at the river towns in this state At Albany and at Hartford the thermometer has stood at 19 deg. below zero, when here it stood only at l2.

We believe an adoption of the plan will be hailed with delight by almost every person in community.\n\n About two years since spirit of benevo- lence was stirred up in this country to an un common degree, in affording aid to the suffer- ing Greeks. Contributions and subscriptions were in almost every town and society sue cessful in raising money to assist Christian nation struggling against Mahomedan oppres- sion. The species of sympathy which was then abroad, did honor to the American name, and endeared us, as a people, to those who from our bounty received such timely assist ance. There is not man among us but what then felt, and still feels, when viewing the struggles of Greece, something of that spirit which moved our fathers to forsake the endearments of social life and the comforts of home, and endure the hardships and dan gers of the tented field to repel tyranny and ppression,--not a man among us whose heart has not been with the patriotic Greek while struggling and bleeding beneath the blows of his merciless oppressor,-not an in dividual but what has rejoiced at his success ses, and mourned at his reverses. This is cause in which Americans can feel, because similar trial was once their own. Formerly the Greeks asked us for the munitions of war flor arms-for military aid ;-and in a meas ure their call was answered. Now, relying upon their own prowess, and the justice of their cause, they only ask us for sustenance for the aged, the infrm, the mother and the child. i've no longer fear the Egyptians\" says one of their Chiefs, \"but while we are fighting with them, we ask our Christian brethren for bread for our wives and children, and for the old men, who have fled to the \"The enemy have been defeat ed, and will be defeated\" write the Epheri of Sparta Y\" but provide food for our wives and who have subsisted on roots, since every thing has been destroyed by our cruel enemy\" In answer to these, and repeated other, and equally pressing calls, the mer- chants of Philadelphia have fitted out cargo with 1900 barrels of flour, and large quanti- ty of ofclothing, which will probably soon arrive to their assistance. A large and respectable meeting has recently been held in New York, and several spirited resolutions were passed, approving of an importunate appeal to every citizen of this free country, to furnish means for procuring food and clothing for ga peo- pie ofChristians, to whom its foe has left no agriculture, no commerce, no arts.\" A com mittee was appointed to adopt measures for collecting subscriptions, not only in that city and state, but in the neighbouring states.-, This new call upon the charities of American citizens will not, it cannot be, passed by un- needed.

            "article": "MAA4 4Ae\n\n The board of Officers which set at Wash ington in Nov. last, for the purpose of stating the defects in the present organization of the Militia, and for recommending remedies, have made their report, which is now before the public. In 1792, when the existing militia laws were enacted by Congress, it was suppo- sed necessary that all the able bodied white male citizens of the United Statcs,-certain classes and persons excepted, ,-between the ages of lo and 45, should be enrolled, in or der to raise a force sufficient to repel invasion and suppress insurrection. Since that time our population has been trebed; and conse quently the number of our militia is thre times as large as was then thought necessar, for the defence ofthe country; while the dan gers from insurrections and invasions arc moi as great as they then were. Hence the pre- sent militia laws, independent of the very de moralizing effect they exert upon community, operate as a heavy and worse than useless tax upon almost all classes in community. To remedy this evil, the following plan has been submitted by the board for the consideration of Congress. Whether it will be adopted at the present session. or whether any of its fea- lures will be altered, before such plan be- comes law, we are unable to learn from a. ny thing we have heard or seen upon the sub ject. The plan is incomparably better than the old regulation, and we sincerely hope that either this, oran improvement upon it will be adopted by Congress.\n\n \"l. It is recommended that there he ap- pointed one Adjutant General for Me Militia of the United States, to be attached to the War Department, but without rank.\n\n 9. That there be appointed, in each State, an Adjutant General of the Militia of the State, and one Quartermaster General of the Militia of the State; or, in time of peace, one officer, to be both Adjutant and Quartermas- ter General: such officer, or officers, to have, each, the rank of Brigadier General.\n\n 8. Itis recommended to exempt all persons, under the age of twenty -One years, in the scv- eral States, from service in the Militia of the { United States. 4. It is recommended that there be enroll 1 ed and organized, in each State, from the whole mass of able bodied white male citizens, resident therein, who are, or shall be, above the age of twentyOne years, and always ta- king the youngest above that age, at the rate of one brigade of Militia, organized as herein proposed, for every member of the House of Representatives of the United States to which the State may be entitled.\n\n 5: It isprOposed that every two brisadcs of Militia, so enrolled in the same State, shall constitute one division; and if there be an odd brigade in the State, above division, that such brigade be attached to some convenient division. at the discretion of the State; that every brigade shall consist of three regiments; every regiment of two battalions; every bat taiion of four troops, or companies and ev- ry troop, or company, of five sergeants, five cOrpOrals, two musicians, and sixty-four pri yates. Each State to have the right to de- signate regiments, battalions, troops, and com panies. as Cavalry, Artillery, Light Infantry, Infantry, and Rihemen, at its discretion; or, to accept as part ofaits quota as above, with out regard to the limitation as to the age of twenty-one years, uniformed volunteer corps Of either arm, if armed and equipped accord ing to designation, and organized as herein proposed.\n\n 6. It is proposed that each State, also, have the right to extend the number of privates, per troop and company, within the State, from the minimum, sixty -four, to any num- ber not exceeding one hundred.\n\n z. Privates in troops of cavalry, to be also designated troopers; and privates m compa. nies of artillery, mattresses; and light infantry and rifemen to be included in the general de examination of intantry.\n\n 6.

It is really a. musng to read this oft repeated charge of the\n\n opposition presses, ,''against the papers which support the administration.

This last charit- able remark of the Times, was elicited in con- sequence ofthe removal, by Mir. Clay, of the U. s. printing from the N. H. Patriot, and Eastern Argus, to two other papers in the same towns where those papers are printed.\n\n This act of MT. Clay is spoken of as an un-\n\n heardo act of arbitrary and tylannical pow CT. But who ever heard of man giving an appointment, which is purely and simply his gift, to most virulent enemy Is it indceda\n\n new thing that the printing of the U. s. laws is taken from,a political opponent and given to political friend! Was such thing never heard of before? How did MT. Hill get the appointment? How did the Secretary of\n\n State under Jefferson conduct this business\n\n Did he leave the printing with the presses appointed under Adams Administration !-\n\n How has similar business within few years,\n\n been transacted in this state Who had the\n\n state printing at Ncw-Haven last spring? Mir.\n\n Clay exercised no stretch of power,-he per\n\n formed no new act, in gi,n the appointment to friend rather than to a foe. The sum is HUI \"o' LII CoH'CuuiH6 tahout, -oulJ Sioo,-- and the principle certainly is not an evidence of corruption and bargain.-The article alIu- ded to, was published in the Timesof the 18th inst. As the editor appeared so sens tive upon the subject, and his indignation a. gainst man who dared to exercise his own right in making appointments, waxed so warm, we confidently hoped that in his pa per of. the 22d we should see an article whip ping the It. Governor, Senator Hill, Sc. for their interference with the appointment of a sheriff's deputy; but we looked for it in vain. This was indeed a corrupt act. Had the appointment of the deputy been in their gift, no man could have complained had they appointed Mir. Baldwin in lieu of MT. Winton but it was not in their gift. They had the effrontcry to call upon the sheriG,who receives his appointment partly from them, to turn put a faithful deputy--not because he is political opponent, but because he dared to oppose part of the previous caucus ticket.- This subject presents theme worthy your pen brother Wells-a subject near home-and one, whether before unheard-of, or common, Al AZ",

This storm was also attended with this peculiar circumstance-it was not preceded by any strong indications or progression in it's commencement, but the first blast of wind that struck the earth, and the snow that came with it, were as great as at any succeeding period of the storm.

To each battalion, one Lieu tenant Colonel, or one Major; but there shall\n\n be only one Lieutenant Colonel in the same regiment, whose battalion. when united with that of the Major, will be entitled to the right\n\n and when, also, both battalions will take the denomination of wings.

We believe an adoption of the plan will be hailed with delight by almost every person in community.\n\n About two years since spirit of benevo- lence was stirred up in this country to an un common degree, in affording aid to the suffer- ing Greeks. Contributions and subscriptions were in almost every town and society sue cessful in raising money to assist Christian nation struggling against Mahomedan oppres- sion. The species of sympathy which was then abroad, did honor to the American name, and endeared us, as a people, to those who from our bounty received such timely assist ance. There is not man among us but what then felt, and still feels, when viewing the struggles of Greece, something of that spirit which moved our fathers to forsake the endearments of social life and the comforts of home, and endure the hardships and dan gers of the tented field to repel tyranny and ppression,--not a man among us whose heart has not been with the patriotic Greek while struggling and bleeding beneath the blows of his merciless oppressor,-not an in dividual but what has rejoiced at his success ses, and mourned at his reverses. This is cause in which Americans can feel, because similar trial was once their own. Formerly the Greeks asked us for the munitions of war flor arms-for military aid ;-and in a meas ure their call was answered. Now, relying upon their own prowess, and the justice of their cause, they only ask us for sustenance for the aged, the infrm, the mother and the child. i've no longer fear the Egyptians\" says one of their Chiefs, \"but while we are fighting with them, we ask our Christian brethren for bread for our wives and children, and for the old men, who have fled to the \"The enemy have been defeat ed, and will be defeated\" write the Epheri of Sparta Y\" but provide food for our wives and who have subsisted on roots, since every thing has been destroyed by our cruel enemy\" In answer to these, and repeated other, and equally pressing calls, the mer- chants of Philadelphia have fitted out cargo with 1900 barrels of flour, and large quanti- ty of ofclothing, which will probably soon arrive to their assistance. A large and respectable meeting has recently been held in New York, and several spirited resolutions were passed, approving of an importunate appeal to every citizen of this free country, to furnish means for procuring food and clothing for ga peo- pie ofChristians, to whom its foe has left no agriculture, no commerce, no arts.\" A com mittee was appointed to adopt measures for collecting subscriptions, not only in that city and state, but in the neighbouring states.-, This new call upon the charities of American citizens will not, it cannot be, passed by un- needed.
