What was to be done For eli\nther party to return, was impossible; to pass\neach other no less so. would almost have\nsacrificed limb to have been free from the\ndanger which threatened. As good Provi-\ndence ordained it, however, our guide recol-\nlectetl that, in the centre of the ladera, then\nout of sight, there was a small ravine. or\nbreak in the mountain, where brook de-\nscendetl, and where, if we could reach be-\nfore the other loose mules met US, we could\nprobably halt in safety. We reached the\nwished-for spot, and crowded our six mules\ninto a small excavation, which a cascade.\nwhen the brook was high, had made, and\nhere waited till 800 mules and four men had\npassed We then came out of our den,\npassed the other part of the ladera, and SO\nreached in safety, another wide and good\nroad.\n\n\nJust before night we passed the second\nladera, called, Laderas de Ia .racas, the\nworst Of them all, but which, with caution,\nwe passed in perfect safety,-Over this,\nventured to walk and let the mule follow,\nbut would not again. Ones head is liable\nto swim, and then his feet to stumble,\nwhereas mules head, in such places, is al\nWAYS clear, and his feet secure.\n\n\nThe sagacity Of this animal in travelling\nover those rough and dangerous roads is tru-\nly remarkable. When he steps on a stone\nwhich rolls or finds his feet likely to give\nway, instead of springing to recover himself.\nlike the horse, he lifts his feet, and places\nthem again, with increased slowness and eau\ntiun, until the danger is passed. When car\nryng baggage, he soon learns to keep at such\ndistance from loaded mules and other objects\nwhich he may meet, as that his cargo sell\ndom strikes any thing around him. In cross\ning these narrow laderas, | observed that\nthe older baggage mules, to avoid contact\nwith the mountains above, would walk all\nmost to the extreme lower edge of the path.\n| This caution of course arises not from any\ndesign to preserve the load in charge, but\nto save themselves from the severe jar,\nwhich every such contact gives them.\nIn the worst and most dangerous places\nthey are perfectly composed, and, if let a.\nlone and suffered to pick their own way,\nwill carry you through them in safety, but,\nas the peones say, \"it is dangerous to force\none o. those animals, where he, on mature\ndelioeration, thinks it not best to CO.\"",

Then sorrowing tears and\nsobs stole from the gentler being and sigh\nexpressed the grief of a manly bosom, and\neach felt the bonds of mutual affection\ndrawn closer as they mourned together over\nthe wreck ofthc young, beautiful, and lately\nhappy creature who was unrepiningly, nay,\ngladly approaching that event which has\nsuch gloom for youthful hearts.\n\n\nOn the morning Of that sabbath, every bc-\nsom in the village was tempered with more\nthan usual solennity, and every prayer that\nassembled came warmer from the heart.\nIhe meeting bell warned me to draw nigh\nthe House OF Gnd, and as went, on every\ncountenance marked the tnr of grief, a\ncalm expression OF sorrow which showed\nthat the spirit was indeed affected.

The last course by the ladera\n\n\nprecipice is sometimes the only one where\n\n\nthe spur can possibly be passed. How this\n4 fOau tllOUp lnG idtReTdS, Idthcl tiiio\npath, was first formed, il is not easy to see.\n! The precipce or slope of the mountain, to-\n\n\nwards the river, though not perpendicular,\n\n\nis nearly so, is at an angle OF Is If not ~\n\n\ndegrees with the horizon. The length of\n\n\nthe laderas is from twelve to thirty rods,\n\n\nand the path along the sides from one to two\nfeet in width. Just sufficient tor the mule to\npass The mountain on tine right hand is\n\n\nso close, that, sitting on the mule, you often\ntouch it with your knee. your hand, and can\nsometimes with your head; and looking up,\nits top is in the clouds But on the lett\n\n\nhand, the precipicc below is the place OF\nhorror You look down a gulf of five, and\nin one place seven hundred feet descent, at\nthe bottom of which rolls the fnrious Men.\n\n\nloza, eight miles an hour, bearing at its top\n\n\ntrees, leaves, grass and mud, and in its bed,\n\n\nstones and rocks continually rumbling, like\n\n\ndistant thunder. So steep is the descent,\n\n\nthat little stones jostled from the path, are\n\n\nalmost instantly in the river, and by one\n\n\nstumble, one slip of the mule. he falls head\n\n\nlong, and none but He who made the noun\n\n\ntains could save you. If there is place on\n\n\nthis rugged earth, which deserves to be\n4 called sublime, it is that seen by him, who\n\n\npasses the laderas, i'll the Andes OF South\ni America.\n\n\nBut while pronounce the places descrin-\n{ ed to be sublime, and even awful tc him\nwho bcholds them, must dissent from the\n\n\nopinion Of those, who thnS there IS, with\n\n\nproper caution, any serious danger in pass\ning them. What proves that there is not\nis the fact, that no one, whom bave seen,\nknows of any human life having been lost\n, here, although this road has been travelled\n; for more than two centuries and a halt\n!

Then sorrowing tears and\nsobs stole from the gentler being and sigh\nexpressed the grief of a manly bosom, and\neach felt the bonds of mutual affection\ndrawn closer as they mourned together over\nthe wreck ofthc young, beautiful, and lately\nhappy creature who was unrepiningly, nay,\ngladly approaching that event which has\nsuch gloom for youthful hearts.\n\n\nOn the morning Of that sabbath, every bc-\nsom in the village was tempered with more\nthan usual solennity, and every prayer that\nassembled came warmer from the heart.\nIhe meeting bell warned me to draw nigh\nthe House OF Gnd, and as went, on every\ncountenance marked the tnr of grief, a\ncalm expression OF sorrow which showed\nthat the spirit was indeed affected. At the\nclose OF the morning services. when our aged\npastor mentioned that funeral sermon\nwould be preached i'll the Afternoon, and n,-\n\n\nmedlately alter, the corpse be conveyed\nfrom the meeting house to the grave, though\n\n\nall previously knew that such was the ar\nransement, a deep hush pc.vadcd the house\nfew tears trickled silently, and when his\n\n\nwords were finished, breathing sound like\ngenera! sigh was heard, and each retired\nwith suJdued and saddencd feelings\n\n\n| Never was our meeting house SO crowded\nas on that afternoon, and all who came were\nnourners. There was no confusion, fer\neach arrived early to have last lock of ono\nthey loved; the coffin with the lid thrown\nopen rested in the broad aisle, and after a\nglance at the still placid features, late all\n6caming with fife aud joyousness, they re-\ntired with softer tread and more halowed\nfeelings. AS the house became fuller tho\nmen silently resigned their seats and stood\nin the aisles, aud many hard, worldly lace,\nWAS shaded with Il raised hat te conceal that\nsoitcning of the teatures which all ragged\nbosoins are ashamed to exhibit. Though\nthe number WAS immense, greater stiffness\nnever reigned, and when the audience rose\nto pray, it was by one simultaneous move\nmcDt without hustle and noise of seats\nwlicn too often prevail. Before the PRAYER\nwas ended, many gentle frames had sunk\nI! down upon the seat soVercome by weeping,\n| and many naughty eye was shaded.\n\n\nI Our ecnerab:e minister. his voice broken\nwith emotion, took tor his text a passage\n! from beautiful chapter Of Iob-1ian COM\neth forth as q .fo,prr, and is CIT DORM; nc\n/ teen also as a shuIo.c, and continneM not.\n! The sermon was such as all ought to be-\n\n\ncalculated to make men better; but the\npreacher felt his subject, and was therefore\neloquent, and he found that the feeling\nwhich made tears stream over his iurrow-\ned cheeks was participated by all present.\nSome few were overborne by the tide otfeel\nling and were compelled to withdraw, but\nitt,\n\n\nand fixed their eyes upon his fearful face,\n\n\nwholly unconscious that the same marks of\nsorrow rolled ever their own cheeks. At\nIntervals a stihed sob was heard, and gentler\n\n\nsoul OF woman was entirely dissolved in\n\n\nweeping. When the sermon was over, and\n\n\nthe low, solemn, oft repeated notes OF the\n\n\nfuneral anthem walled on the car, mourning\n\n\nthe supremacy of death, cold shudder\n\n\nwent through the house, and look OF dcs-\n\n\npairing widncss was OIL many features; but\n\n\nwhen the strain swelled into the glorious\n\n\npeal OF triumph that another angel was adj\n\n\nded to the skies, every heart was resigned,\n\n\nand with returning confidence and hope ech-\n\n\noetl the sentiment, \"Oh, grave, where is\n\n\nthy victory =\n\n\nThe simple procession was soon on its\n\n\nway. The hearse was in attendance, but\n\n\nwas not allowed to be used; a number OF\n\n\nYoung men who knew the deceased and low\n\n\ned her as a sister, took the bier upon their\n\n\nshoulders, and occasionally relieving each\n\n\nother, bore the respected bulthen all the\n\n\nway to the grave.
