States, in such project, can\nnot but be aware ofthe great danger to which\ntheir liberty is exposed, seeing thus blasted\nthe progress of the sacred cause throughout\nAmerica; and all these facts being evident,\nit results that the said project can only be\nfounded or sustained upon calculation on\nthe consent of all, or, at least, of greater\npart Of the new states.\n\n\n1t is not necessary that we introduce here\na particular notice Of Brazil. 1t must be re.\nceived as established that its Government is\none of the two to which this new monster is\nto give birth.
