We believe that the slight regard in which\nstrict truth is held among mankind. is principally\nowing to the lies which arc told 10 children BY their\nparents during the lew FIRST years OF their lives\n\n\nhen is the time that permanent impressions :aay\nre as well made as any later period. 1t is them\nprobably, that what is called the natural propensity\nOF child is unfoIced. Many persons rho haze\ngreat abhorrencs Of lying, and Whip their children\n\n\nthey detect them in 1t. yet make no scrupfe of tel\niing and acting to them the most atrocious false\nhoods. There ave few parents who do not do this\nin greater lesser degree, though doubtless with\nout dreaming they are guilty of criminal deception.\nWith many the whole business OF managing their\nchildren is piece OF mere ar6ce and trick. They\nare cheated in their amusements, cheated 10 their\nood, cheated in their dress Lies are told them 10\nget them to do any thing which is disagreeable. II\na child is to axe physc, the mother tells him she\nhas something good for him to drink; if recusan,,\nshe says she will send for the doctor to cut off his\nears or pull his teeth, that she will go away snd\nleave him, and thousand things OF the same kind,\neach Of which may deceive once and answer the\npresent purpose, but will invariably fail afterwards.\nParents are too apt to endeavor to pacify their\nchildren BY making promises that they never intend\nto perform. II they wish, for instance to take away\nsome ea,abe which they fear will be injurious, they\nreconcile them by the promise of ride. or walk,\nor something else which will please them, but with\nOUT any intention OF gratifying them.\n\n\nThis is lying. downright lying. People think\nnothing of breaking their promises to children, ii\nthe performance be not perfectly convenient But\nthey are the las, persons to whom promises should\nbe broken, because they cannet comprehend the\nreason, if there be one, why they are not kept.\nSuch promises should be scrupulously redeemed,\nthough at q great Inconvenience, and even when in\nadver,en,ly made. For The chiid's moral habit is\nof infinitely more consequence than such an incon\nvenience can be TO parent.\n\n\nWe have only noticed few Of The eases Of lying",

He informs me that it the natives with\nwhom he 10 perfectly acquainted. are worthy Of\ncredit there must be North West Passage. They\ndescribe very large river that runs parallel With\nThe Mackenzie, and falls into the sea near Icy\nCape, at the mouth of which there is an establish\nme nj on an island where ships come to trade. They\nassert that the people there very wicked, having\nhanged several of the natives 10 the rigging they\nwear their boards long. Some rclianoe, should\nthink. may be laid on their satemen as Mr.. Macleod\nshowed US some Russian coins, combs, ard several\narticles Of hardware, very different from those fur\nnished by the British Company. MIR. Macleod\ncaused the natives to assemble last summer, tor the\npurpose of accompanying him in his departure for\nHudson's Bay. The sea is said 10 be open alter\nJuly. This gentieman's conduct affords striking\nexample of the effects of perseverance. In the\nshort space Of eleven months, he visited the Polar\nSea- and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, undergo\ning such hardships and dangers as perhaps, were\nnever experienced by any other individual\"",

In order to faci\nlilae their views they have applied to the Ltgish-\nture Of this state for act of incorporation under\nThe above title. We observe BY the Legislative\nproceedings that their application has bees before\nthe House, where it has met with some opposition,\nbut as we think, under erroneous impressions as to\nthe objects of the company We understand from\ncoed authority, tha, the settlement at Moa is not\nonly patroniEed by the local authorities of Cuba.\nbut 10 made with express reference, and in conlor-\nnifty to decree Of the King OF Spain, Of October\n2lst, 1917, the title Of which explains its object\n:\" Real Cedula sobrs aumentar Ia pottacion biance\nde Ia Ista de Cuba': that is. Royal Decree on\nthe subject Of increasing the trhite population of The\nIsland OF Cuba.''\n\n\nOno ground of opposition, as 1t appears by the\ndebate reported in the Albany papers, vas that The\ngranting Of the application would encourage negro\nslavery. The views OF the association have been\nentirely misconstrued. So far from this being the\nfact, the company neither own, nor intend ever to\nown single slave. The climate Of Moa is uneom-\nmonty temperate, and it has been proved by expo\nrence that uhite man can pei iform bodily labor\nthere. with little danger to his health in this\nstate. One Of the principal objects of the Company\nis to demonstrate by actual experiment that the\nland can be cultivated uithout the labor Of btackss\nand to set an example, which, if followed through\nout the island will deprive The monsters who traffic\nin human flesh, Of their principal market.\n\n\n\". T. GaS.\n\n\nNorth West Passage - In letter from Mr..\nDouglas, the botanist to DR.. Hooker, dat. d from\nthe Great Falls on the Columbia river, the 24th Of\nMarch, 1923, there is the 10 lowing curious para.\ngraph respecting the North West Passage:\n\n\nThere is here Mr.. Macleod, who spent the\nlast Ave years at Fort Good Hope, on the Macken-\nzie river. He informs me that it the natives with\nwhom he 10 perfectly acquainted. are worthy Of\ncredit there must be North West Passage. They\ndescribe very large river that runs parallel With\nThe Mackenzie, and falls into the sea near Icy\nCape, at the mouth of which there is an establish\nme nj on an island where ships come to trade. They\nassert that the people there very wicked, having\nhanged several of the natives 10 the rigging they\nwear their boards long. Some rclianoe, should\nthink. may be laid on their satemen as Mr.. Macleod\nshowed US some Russian coins, combs, ard several\narticles Of hardware, very different from those fur\nnished by the British Company. MIR. Macleod\ncaused the natives to assemble last summer, tor the\npurpose of accompanying him in his departure for\nHudson's Bay. The sea is said 10 be open alter\nJuly. This gentieman's conduct affords striking\nexample of the effects of perseverance. In the\nshort space Of eleven months, he visited the Polar\nSea- and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, undergo\ning such hardships and dangers as perhaps, were\nnever experienced by any other individual\"",
