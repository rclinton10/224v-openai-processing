In conformity with the\nprovisions of the law, the Managers pro\nceeded TO discharge the trust conhdeo 20\nthem. After riis period the Managers u.\nniteG, in opinlor, that one OF rhem should\nsign the Tickets, and receive and make pay\nment of prizes Unfortunately for me, or,\nas the self-created Trustees would have It,\nfor the Church, was selected tor that pur-\npose, the residue OF the Managers giving me\ntheir bond OF indemnity against any loss IN\nthe performance of that duty\n\n\nThe scheme of this Lottery was sold to\nThomas Hope, Broker. by and with the\nconsent Of the Ma1tgers, for the sum of\nthree thousand dollars-to be drawn in Six\nclasses, ayable $500 at the drawing of each\nclass. Cuder that ARRANGEMENT Mr.. Hope\nwent on, and drew two classes, For those\ntwo classes paid the Church in cash and\nNote, and payment Of her debts the tull a\nmount aud upwards, say sixteen hundred\nand FIVE dollars aud fourteen cents. The\n! Third class Of this Lottery, was subsequent\n\" under the direction of Patrick Higgins,\nand conducted by him, and many of the TICK\n\n\ncts in that class remained unsold. The pri-\nzcs in that class was called on for, and OBJ\nliged to pay; by my SIGNING, ] was pledged\nTO redeem them, On Hope failing in his en-\nragemcnts the Fourth class was sold to\n\n\nNrssrs Yates and M.lntyre. The money\nreceived for thr clas, drawn BY them, ace\ncording to contract, was applied (and paid\nto the deficiency Of the Sd class, conducted\nj BY Patrick Higgins.

            "raw_text": "STABLES.\n\n\nNarrow stalls are source Of great incon\nvenience and danger to horse when he\nturns round in them. In the course of my\npractice, have met with several cases OF\ndiseased spines or back bones from this\ncause only. Injuries Of this kind are gener-\nally beyond relief, IN which account they\npoint out very forcibly the necessity pre-\nvention.\n\n\nWhen the horse is required to turn round\nin a narrow stall, his own experience OF his\nsituation would teach him to move back\nwards out of it, but the groom prevents him\nfrom so doing, by standing close behind him,\nand urging him, either by a Threatening tone\nOf voice, or whip, 10 turn instantaneously\nia a space considerably shorter than his own\nbody.\n\n\nAlthough by exerting the utmost ficxihil\nity of his frame, the animal may, perhaps,\nperform this motion daily without injury, he\nis, nevertheless, exposed to an accident\nwhich may in an instant render him tor tie\nfuture totally unserviceable.\n\n\nThe width of the STALL therefore, should\nbe at least six feet, the length nine feet\nThis will enable the horse to stretch out his\nlimbs when he is lying down, which great\nrelief to him when he is tatigued.\n\n\nThe manner in which the stall is usually\npaved, is equally productive OF bad effects.\nThe surface is generally formed with de-\nscent from the head of the stall backwards,\nwith a view to let the urine run off from the\nlitter. Thus the horse stands continually\nup hill, by which position he naturally be-\ncanes so much fatigued, that he may be said\nto have performed his work before ne is out\nOF the stable. For the lgaments OF his\njoints and flexor muscles of his legs, are\nthereby perpetually extended. If the read\ner will stand for few minutes, with his\ntoes higher than his heels, the pain he will\nfeel in the calves of his legs will soon con\nvince him of the truth of this remark.-\nHence, when the horse is not eating, he al\nWAYS endeavors to find his level, either BY\nstanding across the stall. or else as far back\nas his halter will permit, SO that his hind\nlegs may meet the ascent of the other side\nOF the channel. But the greatest mischiefs\nwhich arise from this mode OF constructing\nshe pavement consist in obligng the horse\nCo stand with his fore legs farther under\nand out Of perpendicular direction, By\nwhich position, he not only acquires habit\nof leaning forward, but also becomes LA\nble to contraction il The heels Of bis feet\nby the weight being principally on the toes\nat moreover promotes an inclination Y\nswelling in the hind legs as wen as bein!\nfrequently the cause Of his body slipping\nbackwards in the stall when he lies dawn\nSO that being atthe utmost extent OF his hal\nter, he has not the power of rising again o.\nhis legs, for want of free use of his head an\nneck.\n\n\nThe ground surface of the stall, therefore\nshould be perfectly level, and paved Wit\nhard bricks A conductor for the urine ma\nbe obtained by means of drain passing fror\nthe centre backwards under the pavemen\n49,, Af 40\nshould sink somewhat lewer than the othe\nparts of it, and the entrance to the drain COY\ncred with an iron CRATE about six inche\nsquare\n\n\n1t will be found advantageous to construc\nthe manger in such manner that it may +\nremoved by sliding into the wall, SO tn.\nwhen the horse has eaten his grain he ma\nhave nothing else to bite at when the groo\nis cleaning him, from which habit hers\nsometimes become crib-biters.\n\n\nThe racks are best made of cast iron,\nwooden rack slaves frequently introdul\nsplinters into the lips during the action\ngathering the hay.\n\n\nThe door of the stable should be at lea\nseven feet in height, which will render Il\nhorse less liable to strike his hsad again\nthe upper part of it in passing through it.\n\n\nWATER.\n\n\nWith regard to water, horses general\nprefer that which is soft and even thick al\nmuddy. Soft water should therefore alwa\nbe given to them if possible. The quaint\nshould be proportional to the labour whi\nthe animal undergoes, for ifhe sweats muc\nhe will consequently require more to rep;\nthe consumption of the fluids of his body.\nIt is customary in hunting stables, to wal\nthe water before che morse drinks it, this\na very bad practice, as it renders him |\nBILE to be grpcd whenever he drinksit\nany other state. 1t certainly is not pruat\n20 give much cold water to horse vii\nhe is heated with exercise, but other\nrods may be found when he may dri\nit with safety. Grooms have a foolish h\nit of galloping horses Immediately af\ndrinking: with the intention of warming\nwater in their stomachs. BY these unnec\nsary precautions, il would appear that C\nwater was both unnatural and prejudicial\nthe animal; but it can only become so fl\nhis being rendered irritable and tender\nthe absurd modes with which he is trea\nin his domesticated state.\n\n\nflashing horses 4vhen 79arm in7urlon\n\n\nInnkeepers and coach-masters would\nit their interest to prevent the abomin;\ncustom of washing horses over their wi\nbodies Immediately after having gone ST.\n\n\n",

            "article": "STABLES.\n\n\nNarrow stalls are source Of great incon\nvenience and danger to horse when he\nturns round in them. In the course of my\npractice, have met with several cases OF\ndiseased spines or back bones from this\ncause only. Injuries Of this kind are gener-\nally beyond relief, IN which account they\npoint out very forcibly the necessity pre-\nvention.\n\n\nWhen the horse is required to turn round\nin a narrow stall, his own experience OF his\nsituation would teach him to move back\nwards out of it, but the groom prevents him\nfrom so doing, by standing close behind him,\nand urging him, either by a Threatening tone\nOf voice, or whip, 10 turn instantaneously\nia a space considerably shorter than his own\nbody.\n\n\nAlthough by exerting the utmost ficxihil\nity of his frame, the animal may, perhaps,\nperform this motion daily without injury, he\nis, nevertheless, exposed to an accident\nwhich may in an instant render him tor tie\nfuture totally unserviceable.\n\n\nThe width of the STALL therefore, should\nbe at least six feet, the length nine feet\nThis will enable the horse to stretch out his\nlimbs when he is lying down, which great\nrelief to him when he is tatigued.\n\n\nThe manner in which the stall is usually\npaved, is equally productive OF bad effects.\nThe surface is generally formed with de-\nscent from the head of the stall backwards,\nwith a view to let the urine run off from the\nlitter. Thus the horse stands continually\nup hill, by which position he naturally be-\ncanes so much fatigued, that he may be said\nto have performed his work before ne is out\nOF the stable. For the lgaments OF his\njoints and flexor muscles of his legs, are\nthereby perpetually extended. If the read\ner will stand for few minutes, with his\ntoes higher than his heels, the pain he will\nfeel in the calves of his legs will soon con\nvince him of the truth of this remark.-\nHence, when the horse is not eating, he al\nWAYS endeavors to find his level, either BY\nstanding across the stall. or else as far back\nas his halter will permit, SO that his hind\nlegs may meet the ascent of the other side\nOF the channel. But the greatest mischiefs\nwhich arise from this mode OF constructing\nshe pavement consist in obligng the horse\nCo stand with his fore legs farther under\nand out Of perpendicular direction, By\nwhich position, he not only acquires habit\nof leaning forward, but also becomes LA\nble to contraction il The heels Of bis feet\nby the weight being principally on the toes\nat moreover promotes an inclination Y\nswelling in the hind legs as wen as bein!\nfrequently the cause Of his body slipping\nbackwards in the stall when he lies dawn\nSO that being atthe utmost extent OF his hal\nter, he has not the power of rising again o.\nhis legs, for want of free use of his head an\nneck.\n\n\nThe ground surface of the stall, therefore\nshould be perfectly level, and paved Wit\nhard bricks A conductor for the urine ma\nbe obtained by means of drain passing fror\nthe centre backwards under the pavemen\n49,, Af 40\nshould sink somewhat lewer than the othe\nparts of it, and the entrance to the drain COY\ncred with an iron CRATE about six inche\nsquare\n\n\n1t will be found advantageous to construc\nthe manger in such manner that it may +\nremoved by sliding into the wall, SO tn.\nwhen the horse has eaten his grain he ma\nhave nothing else to bite at when the groo\nis cleaning him, from which habit hers\nsometimes become crib-biters.\n\n\nThe racks are best made of cast iron,\nwooden rack slaves frequently introdul\nsplinters into the lips during the action\ngathering the hay.\n\n\nThe door of the stable should be at lea\nseven feet in height, which will render Il\nhorse less liable to strike his hsad again\nthe upper part of it in passing through it.\n\n\nWATER.\n\n\nWith regard to water, horses general\nprefer that which is soft and even thick al\nmuddy. Soft water should therefore alwa\nbe given to them if possible. The quaint\nshould be proportional to the labour whi\nthe animal undergoes, for ifhe sweats muc\nhe will consequently require more to rep;\nthe consumption of the fluids of his body.\nIt is customary in hunting stables, to wal\nthe water before che morse drinks it, this\na very bad practice, as it renders him |\nBILE to be grpcd whenever he drinksit\nany other state. 1t certainly is not pruat\n20 give much cold water to horse vii\nhe is heated with exercise, but other\nrods may be found when he may dri\nit with safety. Grooms have a foolish h\nit of galloping horses Immediately af\ndrinking: with the intention of warming\nwater in their stomachs. BY these unnec\nsary precautions, il would appear that C\nwater was both unnatural and prejudicial\nthe animal; but it can only become so fl\nhis being rendered irritable and tender\nthe absurd modes with which he is trea\nin his domesticated state.\n\n\nflashing horses 4vhen 79arm in7urlon\n\n\nInnkeepers and coach-masters would\nit their interest to prevent the abomin;\ncustom of washing horses over their wi\nbodies Immediately after having gone ST.\n\n\n",
