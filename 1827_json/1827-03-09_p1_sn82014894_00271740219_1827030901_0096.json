And if equal, or higher prices be obtain\ned within territories, an additional a1yan.\ntage would accrue to the whole Commonwealth.\n\n\nThese and other reasons which might be men\ntoned, have operated TO produce strong and an\nincreasing conviction in the public mind that some\ndecisive measures are necessary to facilitate the\nintercourse between Boston and the Hudson river a\nor near Albany. 1t is measure which His Excel\nlency the Governor has repeatedly urged upon the\nattention Of the Legislature. The necessity Of The\nmeasure has been cvinced by the appointment Of\nBoard OF Commissioners to explore route for\ncanal; evinced by the general anxiety felt for the\nsuccess of that enterprise, and the regret that\nmore favorable route could not have been ascertain\ned. 1t has been recently eyinced by repeated meet\n| ings and resolves in various parts oil the Common\nwealth and also by highly respectable petitions.\nsigned by some of the most intelligent, influential\nand wealthy citizens n the community.\n\n\n| The committee then review the two means\n| of inter communication which have been most\nthough, Of, levels and railways, and after candid\nexamination of the advantages, expenses, &c OF\n| each, come to the conclusion that the latter is pre-\nfcrsble The irst cost OF an iron Railway, with\ntwo sets of tracks, is less than that Of canal,\nand the expense of repairs essentially iess.-The\ncost OF the Quincy Railway is stated at 8l1 o52 90\ncts. q mile, which is believed to be a third more\nThan like undertaking would now cost.\n\n\nIn answer to the Circular appended TO this Re\n| port, your Committee have received estimates Of\nthe amount of tonnage from between thirty and for\nty towns, in the five western counties oi this Com\nmon wealth.-From Of the largest towns no\nreturns have been received. and Of course are not\nestimated. The average amount Of tonnage IN each\n\n\ntown returned, is upwards of five hundred and fifty\neight tons annually And the conviction appears\ngeneral ,ha. should the price Of transportation be\nreduced, great and increasing addition would be\nmade to this amount. The returns also state, with\nvery few exceptions, that The land to be occupied by\nthe Railway would be given.\n\n\ni The navigation Of the Hudson River from Alba\nny to New York is upon average suspended by\nice one fourth part of the year. And this circum\nstance would contribute, in no small degree, TO in\ncrease the extent Of business upon the contempls\nted road. The transportation OF passengers end\nmails would add TO it.-Stages are no. SO liable 10\naccidents upon Railway as upon common road\n\n\nwhile their speed can be greatly increased A con\nvenience not afforded by canals.\n\n\nI The extensive advantages OF opening canal be-\n\n\n\n\n\nand national point of view, have already been pre-\nsented to the Legislature. And II 80 great advan\ntaees would result from canal it is safe to con-\ncude that much greater advantages would be real\nlied by tha construction OF Railway, and at d.\nminished expenditure.\n\n\nThe extension Of the proposed Railway from the\nwestern line of Massachusetts, 10 the Hudson.\nis a measure, which your Committee believe will\n\n\nmeet the enlightened views and receive the cordial\nco operation of the government OF the State OF\nNew York. In support o! this opinion they refer\n; to the letter Of His Excellency De Witt Clinton.\nmarked B. The public journals in the nelehbor-\nhood Of the Hudson have already expressed live\nly interes, in this enterprise ard no opposition can\nbe apprchended from the liberal policy which actu\n, stes our sister State.\n\n\nFrom these considerations, your Committee are\nsatisfied of the Practicability and convinced of\nthe E1 pedisncy of constructing Railway from\n\n\nBoston to the Hudson, the cost OF which can 10 their\n\n\nopinion be accurately estimated only after actual sur\nyey.\n!, In closing their report. your Committee would\nearnestly express their deep sense of the impor-\ntance Of the design. which has been submitted to\ntheir consideratc vestigation. design. intended\nto procure for Massachusetts the enjoyment OF the\nproducts OF her territory, the interest OF her\nown capital the intercourse Of her own population,\nthe accumulation of her own resources; design\nworthy the attention of free and powerful com\n\n\nmunity, worthy the mature and deliberate consd\n\n\nGrafton Of an enlightened Legislature, and worthy\nthe active enterprise Of an American S'ate; de\n\n\nSIGN too important in its results and too beneficial ia\nits consequences to be lightly laid aside; tco honor\n\n\nable to the character of Massachusetts, 1t capable\nOf successful accomplishment, to be abandoned\nwithout careful and accurate inquiry. Guided\nby these views, your Committee would respectfully\nrecommend the adoption Of the following\nRESOLVES s.\n\n\nRScoT,,pd That the Governor OF this Common\n\n\n,u~.ltl hv und with the cnnsert of the Council, be",

And if equal, or higher prices be obtain\ned within territories, an additional a1yan.\ntage would accrue to the whole Commonwealth.\n\n\nThese and other reasons which might be men\ntoned, have operated TO produce strong and an\nincreasing conviction in the public mind that some\ndecisive measures are necessary to facilitate the\nintercourse between Boston and the Hudson river a\nor near Albany. 1t is measure which His Excel\nlency the Governor has repeatedly urged upon the\nattention Of the Legislature. The necessity Of The\nmeasure has been cvinced by the appointment Of\nBoard OF Commissioners to explore route for\ncanal; evinced by the general anxiety felt for the\nsuccess of that enterprise, and the regret that\nmore favorable route could not have been ascertain\ned. 1t has been recently eyinced by repeated meet\n| ings and resolves in various parts oil the Common\nwealth and also by highly respectable petitions.\nsigned by some of the most intelligent, influential\nand wealthy citizens n the community.\n\n\n| The committee then review the two means\n| of inter communication which have been most\nthough, Of, levels and railways, and after candid\nexamination of the advantages, expenses, &c OF\n| each, come to the conclusion that the latter is pre-\nfcrsble The irst cost OF an iron Railway, with\ntwo sets of tracks, is less than that Of canal,\nand the expense of repairs essentially iess.-The\ncost OF the Quincy Railway is stated at 8l1 o52 90\ncts. q mile, which is believed to be a third more\nThan like undertaking would now cost.\n\n\nIn answer to the Circular appended TO this Re\n| port, your Committee have received estimates Of\nthe amount of tonnage from between thirty and for\nty towns, in the five western counties oi this Com\nmon wealth.-From Of the largest towns no\nreturns have been received. and Of course are not\nestimated. The average amount Of tonnage IN each\n\n\ntown returned, is upwards of five hundred and fifty\neight tons annually And the conviction appears\ngeneral ,ha. should the price Of transportation be\nreduced, great and increasing addition would be\nmade to this amount. The returns also state, with\nvery few exceptions, that The land to be occupied by\nthe Railway would be given.\n\n\ni The navigation Of the Hudson River from Alba\nny to New York is upon average suspended by\nice one fourth part of the year. And this circum\nstance would contribute, in no small degree, TO in\ncrease the extent Of business upon the contempls\nted road.
