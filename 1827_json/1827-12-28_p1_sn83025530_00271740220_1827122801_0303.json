Jefvrsons\nopinion of General jackson a statesman was less\nfavorable believe his opinion on this subject was\nnotorious among those who possessed any share OF\nhis confidence. | remember to have heard Mr. JET\nferson, on one occasion, an expression, which\nstruck me. not so much by the sentiment II cantaIn-\ned, (Which, indeed was then very common one IN\nVirginia. as the style in which it was made Speak\ning of the several candidates for he Presidency. be-\nfore the last election. he remarked that \"nne might\nas well make sailor of cock. or a soldier OF a\ngoosp, as President of Andrew Jacksun.\" These\nwords made an indeble impression on my memory.\nThey were uttered with tone of sportise. almost\ncontemptuous dersiun.
