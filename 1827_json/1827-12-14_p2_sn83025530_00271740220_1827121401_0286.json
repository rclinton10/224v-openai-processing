William e. G. Claiborne, in this VIC\ntim to his devotion to the public good, and to his\nlove Of country for. induced by these sentiments\nhe had transferred to him all his military authority,\nand put at his disposal all the resources OF the state\nHe has. in direct violation of the orders whichhe\nhad received from his government, committed acts\nof hostility against neutral nation, and possessed\nhimself of a portion of her soil acts the more res\nponsible as they exposed the republic to all the hor\nrors Of war; if the injured nation had not been N\nsuch state of feebleness that she could not demand\nsatisfaction for such an injury. 4\nHe has denounced US in mass he has denounced\nmany of our most respectable citizens, and Our own\nlegislature, as traitors % the country although at\nthat time and ever since, we have all given prons\nof our patriotism. our devotion TO the public good, 7\nand our sincere attachment 10 the Union\nBut, saw his partisans, his arbitrary acts upon the\nsoil of Louisiana, were required by necessity: the\nenemy were upon our territory or in our waters\ntheir presence placed in imminent hazard this por-\nton of the Union. Vain excuse The defeated\nenemy had for several weeks before retired from\nour soil, and had embarked in their vessels. Is 1t\nnot absurd to suppose that, vanqushea as the% were\nthey would again trust their fortunes to the tate OF\narms , And BESIDES was it danger Of his situation\nor the case of necessity which caused him to exer-\nelse those arbitrary and tyranncal acts OF which\nhe was guilty at Pensacola. towards Gov Caava,\nan officer invested with public character, and who\nwas only accountable to the king of Spain Tor his\nconduct? Was it necessity, or the enemy winch\ndictated the arbitrary measures pursued by \\. jack\nson against Judge Fromentln?\n\n\nIs it, in fine, the law of necessity. which ten\nwears after the has induced the general to de-\nfame this state, in the persons of its legislators\n\n\nNav the people of Louisiana never permit the\npast to be efaced from their memory. May they\npro6tng by these terrible lessons, consider their\npresent condition, the happiness, the liberty. the\nprosperity they enjoy and with them it is lett. to\npronounce if it be reasonable to hope. that they\nshould preserve for any time, the advantages they\npossess under the sage and paternai administration\nof John Quincy Adams. if they cause him to descend\nfrom that situation, to which he has been constitu-\ntionally called, by the representatives OF the people\nand the plurality Of surages, and replace him by\nman. who, as his friends confess. has neither the ac-\nqurements. nor the talents. nor the application, re-\nquired in the first magistrate OF the Union\n\n\nResolved. That we consider the American Fedc-\nration as one and ndivlslbe; that, as has been\ntaught us BY the hero of our independence. we deem\nthat the interests of each part OF the republic form\nthe interests of the whGle; 1ha therefore, in tht\nchoice which we have to make of the first magistrate\nof the state we repe the idea that we ought to b.\ninfluenced by local distinctions and we pride our\nselves in proclaimng TO the world, that it is only Il\nthe most capable. the most vrtuous. that we vii\ngive our preference. which ever be the section of bt\nUnion to which he belongs.\n\n\nRescIued, That upon these considerations. WI\nwill promute. to the best of ability. the reelec\ntion of JOHN QUINCY ADAMS 10 the presiden\ncy and that, among other reass switch dccrnln\nus, we delight to enumerate the following =\n\n\nst. Because, young, he was distinguished b\nWashington at later period. he was honoured b\nthe confidence of Jefferson. Madison aud Monroe\nand that, brought up in their school. be has shown\nsince his coming to the presidency, that he has we\nstudied their lessons, and that he was worthy to b\nthe successor of these fathers of their country.\n\n\n2d. Because our institutions. and the care of h;\nsocial part which unltes the American family, car\nnot be confined to purer hands, than to those of tn\nman, Who in every duty which he has been cae\nupon to perform, has always shown himself i\nmost firm supporter, and Its most eloquent defer\nder\n\n\nCd. Because, long before he was called to Il\nhead of affairs, the talents. the patriotism, and Il\nintegrity displayed in the exercise of the enne\nfunctions. with which he bad been charged, gave\nthe American people sure pledge OF his condu\nas chief of the nation. and that the opinion ente\ntanned of him has been fully justified by all the &C\nof his administration.\n\n\n4th. Because the republic, which. by the wislo\nof his predecessors in the presidency had been tt\nfor the highest desnies, has ceased to b\nunder the influence ofhis genius happy within. re\npccted without and that, still shielded by the SAL!\nevery thing presages to him further prosperous al\nbrilliant career.\n\n\n5. Because his rcpublicanism and his love Of\nder are too we'll known, to allow us to fear ht\nduring his presidency. the military authority W\never dare to encroach upon the civil, and thus G\ndanror thn safe nf tho state",
