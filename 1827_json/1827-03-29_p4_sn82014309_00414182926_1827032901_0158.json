The mournful visage ofMrs. Campbell, as she clasped the hand of the dying man, was painful to behold, for even the most careless observer could discov- CT utter hopelessness written there.\n\n The surgeon on interrogating Campbelre- specting the manner in which the wound was inflicted, was led to believe that the unhappy and mysterious man had fallen the victim of his own hand, and the deep rooted melancho ly that had obtained possession of his mind and actions, rendered it highly probable that this supposition was correct. When first car ried below, after his wound had been staunch- ed, he turned to his wife and said in tone scarcely audible, \"behold my prediction yer flied; you treated lightly my superstitlous feelings; but had prescience that should never tread on earth again.\n\n (Concluded in our nert.)",

When we had performed .our quarantine, and discharged our cargo that we had to Grand Canary, we came directly to this place, and were waiting hero to obtain li- cence from the government to take passen- gers, for within few months an order has\n\n been sent out here, from the King, preven- ting aN foreign vessels from taking natives of these Islands away consequently we kept the vessel here to wait the result of an interview with the government, to go on with the expedition, and finally, few days previous to the loss of the vessel, we succeeded, and had taken in large quan- tity of store, &c. for the passengers and, the day before we were ready to sail for Lanzarretto, there came on one of the most tremendous hurricanes that the old est inhabitants remember to have witness ed in these islands. Notwithstanding it came on very suddenly, and right on shore, I had got off cabin cable.and anchor, from the shore, before the communication to the vessel became impracticable--b the storm ragged with incseasing fury, every vessel parted, and went on to the beach, one af- ter another, the wind hauled every fifteen | minutes, so that no vessel could ride strain on more than one cable, till at length my small bower parted, and the chain was let go, and scope vered out-the sea was very bad, the boats all washed away, the vessel was unable to bear so hard labour, and leaked very badly still every thing was done to keep her free, and save her, but all in vain-at half past 9, the best bower parted, and the chain and anchor would not bring her up, and she was dash ed against the rocks, and in five minutes nothing was to be seen of the Potomac but some small pieces afoat in the surf; and with her, my mate and cook shared the same fate the rest, some made their es- cape by throwing themselves from the yards and rigging on to the rocks, and some were thrown up by the sea on to the rocks, with broken arms and legs and have scarcely recovered yet sufficiently to write you description of the shocking scene. The general destruction, in all the island. has not left vessel that we can procure.''\n\n The Potomac was to take her passen- gers at Lanzaretto, and proceed to Monte Video.",

Campbell had heretofore admired and enjoyed this state of the elements, for what is better calculated to raise the contemplative mind from earthly matters than to behold in an autumn evening a cloudless sky reflected on the glassy surface of the slumbering ocean? But now the dead calm was torture to his restless spirit. He prayed for motion, and his impatlence was betrayed in every action. His eyes were wild and wandering, and his movements abrupt and hurried. He inquired of the oldest sea man from which quarter of the compass might. be expected the approach of the next tenn pest. and to that quarter were his eyes con stantly directed, where every ascending cloud appeared to bring a fresh hope to his desOlate heart.\n\n At length tie long looked for storm arose in all its grandeur. Volumes of dense clouds regularly and gradually ascended like forlni- dabIe armies preparing for battle. The winds that had been pent up, now burst forth, and the roaring waters heaved with a convulsive motion. The spell was broke that had har- monized creation, and discord now prevailed The appearance of Campbell became visibiy changed. His countenance was animated ;- there was a smile of terrible, but undefned meaning upon his lips; his eyes glanced wild ly from the sea te the heavens, and he tra- versed the deck with a rapidity of step that excited the wonder of all who beheld him. Our vessel was soon prepared to encounter the worst but as the wind blew steadily from one quarter we felt no apprehensions for eur safety.-The sky was completely overcast, and the rain descended in torrents. Campbell still remained upon deck, after all the passen- gers and crew, excepting those upon watch, had retired to rest. No persuasion could in- duce him to go below, and to the entreaties ofhis wife and the captain, he replied: \" It is the only joyful hour l have experienced since came on board; Ibeseechs you not to interruptit.\"\n\n They left him, and he seated himselfin the most retired part of the ship, to brood upon his feelings had retired to my birth, but found it impossible to close my eyes, for the raging waters made such an awful coil as they dashed against the sides of the ship, and gave rise to reflections that would have kept me awake even had my mind been fortified with the philosophy of the little Captain. After tossing in my bed for about two hours, until the fever of my mind was communicated to my body, imagined hearda piercing shriek proceeding from the deck. It was immediate ly followed by groan. leaped from my bed and rushed to the gangway. l met the captain at the foot of the stairs, who had been awakened by the same noise. On seeing me, he exclaimed Mon dieu le melancaolique gentlehomme !\" and ascended as rapidly as his ,diminutive legs would carry him. I follow ed him, and we hurried towards the place where we had left Campbell the preceding evening. m\n\n Lights were speedily brought, and lying on the deck we beheld Campbell, welterng in his blood. l raised him-the wound was in his bosom, and bleeding proftlsely.- \"Good God '' exclaimed, \"who has done 1his 2\"\n\n \"The Tempest Fiend,\" he answered. \"We have had a long and fearful struggle ;- but thank God, it is over. Iproved unequal to the combat, and he has marked me for the caverns ofthe deep.\" He laughed hysterical- ly, and big drops of precipitation burst from his pale forehead. l called for assistance to carry him below.\n\n \"NO, no,\" he cried, \"let me die here. I shall be called fer before to-morrows sun ri- ses, for the spirits ofthe water are preparing my abode in their coral caves.

The physician vouched for the innocence of his patient, declaring it physically impossible that he could stir from his hammock. He pro- nounced him in fair way to recover, but as yet incapable of moving. \"And then what motiye,\" said he, could possibly exist in the bosom of man, himself apparently on the verge of eternity. sufficient to excite exhaust ed nature to the performance of the act of fend 2\"\n\n Campbell was carried below, and after his wound was staunched, was left alone with his wife, the presence of any other person being painful to him.

His eyes followed me, and felt relieved when I had escaped from their glare.\n\n I retired to my birth, and endeavOred to sleep, but my mind had become so feverish by the dreadful occurrences of the night, that tossed about for several hours in painful state of restlessness. At length fell into slurnber, but it was slumber more dreadful than my waking contemplations for the ghastly face of the seaman was seen where ever turned my eyes.

The storm still continued, and ap- pearances indicated that it would do so for some days.\n\n Mrs. Campbell watched by the beside of her husband during the night, in a state of agony that can be more readily conceived than described; for the surgeon on examining the wound, pronounced a speedy death inev- itable. When the earthly ties which bind the pure to the innocent are violently 'vered, the pang sustained by the survivoris too frequent ly almost insupportable, although the bright promise of meeting hereafter may cast ray of comfort around the heart of the mourner {; what then must the guilty feel, who are bound by ties that cannot exist in heaven, and which, when broken here, leave the torn heart with out hope remaining! The mournful visage ofMrs. Campbell, as she clasped the hand of the dying man, was painful to behold, for even the most careless observer could discov- CT utter hopelessness written there.\n\n The surgeon on interrogating Campbelre- specting the manner in which the wound was inflicted, was led to believe that the unhappy and mysterious man had fallen the victim of his own hand, and the deep rooted melancho ly that had obtained possession of his mind and actions, rendered it highly probable that this supposition was correct. When first car ried below, after his wound had been staunch- ed, he turned to his wife and said in tone scarcely audible, \"behold my prediction yer flied; you treated lightly my superstitlous feelings; but had prescience that should never tread on earth again.\n\n (Concluded in our nert.)",

Notwithstanding it came on very suddenly, and right on shore, I had got off cabin cable.and anchor, from the shore, before the communication to the vessel became impracticable--b the storm ragged with incseasing fury, every vessel parted, and went on to the beach, one af- ter another, the wind hauled every fifteen | minutes, so that no vessel could ride strain on more than one cable, till at length my small bower parted, and the chain was let go, and scope vered out-the sea was very bad, the boats all washed away, the vessel was unable to bear so hard labour, and leaked very badly still every thing was done to keep her free, and save her, but all in vain-at half past 9, the best bower parted, and the chain and anchor would not bring her up, and she was dash ed against the rocks, and in five minutes nothing was to be seen of the Potomac but some small pieces afoat in the surf; and with her, my mate and cook shared the same fate the rest, some made their es- cape by throwing themselves from the yards and rigging on to the rocks, and some were thrown up by the sea on to the rocks, with broken arms and legs and have scarcely recovered yet sufficiently to write you description of the shocking scene.

Campbell had heretofore admired and enjoyed this state of the elements, for what is better calculated to raise the contemplative mind from earthly matters than to behold in an autumn evening a cloudless sky reflected on the glassy surface of the slumbering ocean? But now the dead calm was torture to his restless spirit. He prayed for motion, and his impatlence was betrayed in every action. His eyes were wild and wandering, and his movements abrupt and hurried. He inquired of the oldest sea man from which quarter of the compass might. be expected the approach of the next tenn pest. and to that quarter were his eyes con stantly directed, where every ascending cloud appeared to bring a fresh hope to his desOlate heart.\n\n At length tie long looked for storm arose in all its grandeur. Volumes of dense clouds regularly and gradually ascended like forlni- dabIe armies preparing for battle. The winds that had been pent up, now burst forth, and the roaring waters heaved with a convulsive motion. The spell was broke that had har- monized creation, and discord now prevailed The appearance of Campbell became visibiy changed. His countenance was animated ;- there was a smile of terrible, but undefned meaning upon his lips; his eyes glanced wild ly from the sea te the heavens, and he tra- versed the deck with a rapidity of step that excited the wonder of all who beheld him. Our vessel was soon prepared to encounter the worst but as the wind blew steadily from one quarter we felt no apprehensions for eur safety.-The sky was completely overcast, and the rain descended in torrents. Campbell still remained upon deck, after all the passen- gers and crew, excepting those upon watch, had retired to rest. No persuasion could in- duce him to go below, and to the entreaties ofhis wife and the captain, he replied: \" It is the only joyful hour l have experienced since came on board; Ibeseechs you not to interruptit.\"\n\n They left him, and he seated himselfin the most retired part of the ship, to brood upon his feelings had retired to my birth, but found it impossible to close my eyes, for the raging waters made such an awful coil as they dashed against the sides of the ship, and gave rise to reflections that would have kept me awake even had my mind been fortified with the philosophy of the little Captain. After tossing in my bed for about two hours, until the fever of my mind was communicated to my body, imagined hearda piercing shriek proceeding from the deck. It was immediate ly followed by groan. leaped from my bed and rushed to the gangway. l met the captain at the foot of the stairs, who had been awakened by the same noise. On seeing me, he exclaimed Mon dieu le melancaolique gentlehomme !\" and ascended as rapidly as his ,diminutive legs would carry him. I follow ed him, and we hurried towards the place where we had left Campbell the preceding evening. m\n\n Lights were speedily brought, and lying on the deck we beheld Campbell, welterng in his blood. l raised him-the wound was in his bosom, and bleeding proftlsely.- \"Good God '' exclaimed, \"who has done 1his 2\"\n\n \"The Tempest Fiend,\" he answered. \"We have had a long and fearful struggle ;- but thank God, it is over. Iproved unequal to the combat, and he has marked me for the caverns ofthe deep.\" He laughed hysterical- ly, and big drops of precipitation burst from his pale forehead. l called for assistance to carry him below.\n\n \"NO, no,\" he cried, \"let me die here. I shall be called fer before to-morrows sun ri- ses, for the spirits ofthe water are preparing my abode in their coral caves.

Suspicion Immediately fell on the shipwrecked stranger, for adyersty is too frequently considered by the prosperous, su- periOr to no action, however atrocious. The physician vouched for the innocence of his patient, declaring it physically impossible that he could stir from his hammock. He pro- nounced him in fair way to recover, but as yet incapable of moving. \"And then what motiye,\" said he, could possibly exist in the bosom of man, himself apparently on the verge of eternity. sufficient to excite exhaust ed nature to the performance of the act of fend 2\"\n\n Campbell was carried below, and after his wound was staunched, was left alone with his wife, the presence of any other person being painful to him.
