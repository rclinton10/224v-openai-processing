His calling out of the mi.\nlitia on the Gath May, 1914, for the period of sr\nmonths was itselfa violation OF the law. After the\n18th of April, 1914 the militia could not be called\nou for longer term Of service than three months.\nNo State authority could, under any circumstances,\nrequire them to serve for longer period. The\nPresident of the United States only authorized\nby the law, it, in has opinion the public interest re-\nqured it, to retain them in service for more than\nthree months and any attempt to compel them 10\nserve tor longer period, without the special order\nof the President, was Illegal There was no such\norder. The Editor Of the Telegraph says. vi\nkas.u no sueh order eristed\" How did he know this\nbut from General Jackson himself!\n\n\nBut, says The Telegraph, owe knew more; that\nIN no case, where militia called into service\nunder the act of 1912, did the President issue an or\nder requiring them TO SIX months ; and thai\nin all cases, the call was not liited to a le:\nterm, the militia were mustered for months\" Al\nthis show OF legal know ledge, and al the differences\nintended TO be grounded upon ii, amount, to nothing\ninasmuch as the act of 1872 had become detunct, b,\nits provision OF limitation. five weeks before th\norder calling out TIE militia, IN TINS case, was issued\nand the OF 795. with the qualification con aimee\nin the act OF April l8, 1914, the only law in ex\nlstence.\n\n\nWe must again refer to the order of General ack\nson calling out these militia in order to show tha\nthe great stress laid by his defenders from this lille\ngal charge of illegal execution on the alarming stat\nof the country, the necessity of making stern exaI\npie in order to preserve the discipline of the troop\nIN the presence Of poaperm enemy, and the urgenc\nof the occasion, which rendered it indispensable th;\nthese should be in the field, is merely the hg\ncoloring ottancy, and is not supportahle in point\nfact. These militia were called ont merely to ga\nrlson and retain possession OF the territory eonque\ned from the Creeks, until appropriated by til\ngovernment and to relieve the troops then i'll ga\nrlson. his fact removes another of the gronn,\non which the severity of General Jackson. in TIA\ninstance, has been justified, and converted into\npositive merit.\n\n\nAs the sole object of this article is to furnish IL\npublic with the materials for an accurate nlgne\nas to the legality or egaity OF the conduct Of Ge\njackson, we shall close.lt with brief and smp\ncondensation of the points which are deducibe fro\nthe facts We have stated\n\n\n1st. 1t is clear from the order of Gen.

His calling out of the mi.\nlitia on the Gath May, 1914, for the period of sr\nmonths was itselfa violation OF the law. After the\n18th of April, 1914 the militia could not be called\nou for longer term Of service than three months.\nNo State authority could, under any circumstances,\nrequire them to serve for longer period. The\nPresident of the United States only authorized\nby the law, it, in has opinion the public interest re-\nqured it, to retain them in service for more than\nthree months and any attempt to compel them 10\nserve tor longer period, without the special order\nof the President, was Illegal There was no such\norder. The Editor Of the Telegraph says. vi\nkas.u no sueh order eristed\" How did he know this\nbut from General Jackson himself!\n\n\nBut, says The Telegraph, owe knew more; that\nIN no case, where militia called into service\nunder the act of 1912, did the President issue an or\nder requiring them TO SIX months ; and thai\nin all cases, the call was not liited to a le:\nterm, the militia were mustered for months\" Al\nthis show OF legal know ledge, and al the differences\nintended TO be grounded upon ii, amount, to nothing\ninasmuch as the act of 1872 had become detunct, b,\nits provision OF limitation. five weeks before th\norder calling out TIE militia, IN TINS case, was issued\nand the OF 795. with the qualification con aimee\nin the act OF April l8, 1914, the only law in ex\nlstence.\n\n\nWe must again refer to the order of General ack\nson calling out these militia in order to show tha\nthe great stress laid by his defenders from this lille\ngal charge of illegal execution on the alarming stat\nof the country, the necessity of making stern exaI\npie in order to preserve the discipline of the troop\nIN the presence Of poaperm enemy, and the urgenc\nof the occasion, which rendered it indispensable th;\nthese should be in the field, is merely the hg\ncoloring ottancy, and is not supportahle in point\nfact. These militia were called ont merely to ga\nrlson and retain possession OF the territory eonque\ned from the Creeks, until appropriated by til\ngovernment and to relieve the troops then i'll ga\nrlson. his fact removes another of the gronn,\non which the severity of General Jackson. in TIA\ninstance, has been justified, and converted into\npositive merit.\n\n\nAs the sole object of this article is to furnish IL\npublic with the materials for an accurate nlgne\nas to the legality or egaity OF the conduct Of Ge\njackson, we shall close.lt with brief and smp\ncondensation of the points which are deducibe fro\nthe facts We have stated\n\n\n1st. 1t is clear from the order of Gen.
