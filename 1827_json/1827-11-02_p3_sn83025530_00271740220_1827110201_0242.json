On the\nnight of the Goth Inst, between the hours of and\nIL O'Clock, the inmates of the prison we're aroused\nfrom their sumbers by the cry Of fire, which pro-\nceeded from the in which the prisoner\nconfined. A vivid light was emitted from the pris-\noners room, which, examination, proceeded\nfrom the southeast corner OF the upper floor imme-\ndately above the prvy, which was on fire. The\nprisoner was standing with his clothes tied up in a\nbundle, with his face to the door, begging to be let\nout The door was then unlocked, and he was ac-\ncused of having set fire to the Jail. He denied it,\nand said it was an accident. A few sticks of wood\nwere then discovered on his hearth with the ends\nburnt, and but little fire in the fireplace. The\nprisoner made his escape, and was apprehended\nand brought back to Dover the evening of the\n2lst Inst. There had been Il man named James\nSpple confined in the same room with the prisoner,\nwho on the morning ofthe Goth was discharged un-\nder the insolvent debtors act TO this man he fire.\nquently observed that he had rather be burnt up\nthan remain in prison until the Quarter Sessions\nand said moreover that he should like to the Jail\nin a light blaze\n\n\nThe jury, after having retired for about an hour,\nbrought in verdict of Guilty.\n| James Rogers, Esquire, Attorney General for the\nState.

He replied that he was innocent. Ills\nhonor, Chief Justice Johns, then proceeded to ad-\ndress and sentence the criminal, which painful duty\nhe discharged in his usual solemn, feeling and appro\npirate manner adding that he had had the benefit\nof far trial and that his council had urged every\nthing which could have been urged in bis favor, but\nthat the circumstances were too strong to admit up\non the minds ofhe Court single doubt of his guilt,\nand concluding with the following sentence:\n\n\nThat you Solomon Greenly be taken hence to the\nplace from whence you came, and there remain in\nthe custody of the Sheriff until Tuesday the Goth\nof November next and be then taken thence by the\nsaid Sheriff to some convenient place, and there,\nbetween the hours Of II o'clock in the forenoon,\nand O'Clock in the afternoon be hung by the neck\nuntil you be dead; and may God have mercy upon\nyour soul.\n\n\nJ, The Court was sensibly effected, and the criminal\nseemed to feel the soemnties OF moment SO aw-\nfull to himself.

On the\nnight of the Goth Inst, between the hours of and\nIL O'Clock, the inmates of the prison we're aroused\nfrom their sumbers by the cry Of fire, which pro-\nceeded from the in which the prisoner\nconfined. A vivid light was emitted from the pris-\noners room, which, examination, proceeded\nfrom the southeast corner OF the upper floor imme-\ndately above the prvy, which was on fire. The\nprisoner was standing with his clothes tied up in a\nbundle, with his face to the door, begging to be let\nout The door was then unlocked, and he was ac-\ncused of having set fire to the Jail. He denied it,\nand said it was an accident. A few sticks of wood\nwere then discovered on his hearth with the ends\nburnt, and but little fire in the fireplace. The\nprisoner made his escape, and was apprehended\nand brought back to Dover the evening of the\n2lst Inst. There had been Il man named James\nSpple confined in the same room with the prisoner,\nwho on the morning ofthe Goth was discharged un-\nder the insolvent debtors act TO this man he fire.\nquently observed that he had rather be burnt up\nthan remain in prison until the Quarter Sessions\nand said moreover that he should like to the Jail\nin a light blaze\n\n\nThe jury, after having retired for about an hour,\nbrought in verdict of Guilty.\n| James Rogers, Esquire, Attorney General for the\nState.

He replied that he was innocent. Ills\nhonor, Chief Justice Johns, then proceeded to ad-\ndress and sentence the criminal, which painful duty\nhe discharged in his usual solemn, feeling and appro\npirate manner adding that he had had the benefit\nof far trial and that his council had urged every\nthing which could have been urged in bis favor, but\nthat the circumstances were too strong to admit up\non the minds ofhe Court single doubt of his guilt,\nand concluding with the following sentence:\n\n\nThat you Solomon Greenly be taken hence to the\nplace from whence you came, and there remain in\nthe custody of the Sheriff until Tuesday the Goth\nof November next and be then taken thence by the\nsaid Sheriff to some convenient place, and there,\nbetween the hours Of II o'clock in the forenoon,\nand O'Clock in the afternoon be hung by the neck\nuntil you be dead; and may God have mercy upon\nyour soul.\n\n\nJ, The Court was sensibly effected, and the criminal\nseemed to feel the soemnties OF moment SO aw-\nfull to himself.
