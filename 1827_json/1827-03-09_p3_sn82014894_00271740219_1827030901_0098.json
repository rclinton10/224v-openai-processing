Jackson\npresident, it possible. but to oppose Internal I'm\nprovement; oppose Domestic Manufactures and\nthe American System, and, in fact, while their\navowed object is to elect General Jackson president.\ntheir real object Isl or its tendency will be, to\nretard the strides Of this nouiishing Republic. to\nwehlth and prospefity--to make us dependent\ninstead Of an independent nation. Al proof Of\nthese facts, look at the late votes on these great\nnational questions in Congsess:- with few excep-\nlions the opposition have voted agsint them.\nBut look nearer home. Our Representative.\nwho heretofore has upheld and supported Domes-\ntic Manufactures, and who was supported, and elect\ned at the last election, principally on the ground Of\nhis being the tried and faithful friend OF our Man\nufactures, has now deserted his post, and in his\nvotes on the \" Woolen 3ill'' has drawn aside the\nmask, and We now see him, as he really 10, opposed\nto the american System.

And further\ncan the friends OF American Manufactures in Del\n/ aware, who supported Mr..
