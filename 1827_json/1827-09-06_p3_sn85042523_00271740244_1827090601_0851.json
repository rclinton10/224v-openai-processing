Z. to the w. N. w. points of the\nhorizon; thongh diffused light, like the\nbreak Of day had been observed in the Aor-\nthern HORIZON during the previous half hour.\nThe zone or arch was midway between the\nzenith and horizon. and about 100 broad, ex-\ncept a. the western extremity, where it was\ncontracted nearly to point. Its Eastern cx-\ntremity was faint, uniform, intermitting\nlight. about its middle, slender streaks or\ncolumns became visible, converging towards\npoint far beyond the zenith, and moving\nlaterally from East to West. with the ra-\npidity of the lower stratum, of clouds in our\ncommon Easterly storus. These columns\nunderlined as they approached the West.\nwhere they appeared almost stationary\nThis appearance continued with little vara-\nton for three quarters of an hour. The\nEastern half Of the arch then disappeared\nentirely, and the remaining part approach\ned the zenith in the form Of a slender, in\nverted pyramid, and gave place to another\nOf half the width, composed of broader col\nunns, more distant, and well defined, NOV\ning but slowly, and presenting very s!nsu-\nlar and striking appearance. \"a supersti-\ntious eye would have construed every col\numn into sword, portending some dire ca\nlamity. The two semi. arches soon united,\nthe upper extremity disappeared. and the\nlower part formed into three long, slender\ncolumns, not unlike the tails of comets, very\nwe'll defined, overlapping each other, and\npointing south Of the zenith. These remain\ncd permanent half all hour. and then grad\nually mingled into one, which soon vanished\n\n\nAt this time III, o'clock) the phenome-\nnon was restricted to the light in the North,\nwhich had gradually becemc SO bright as to\ncast faint shadow, and had assumed the\nform of low rainbow, sending directly up\nwards long, slender luminous beams. which\nmoved in a lateral direction, backward and\nforward. and remained visible some minutes.\nFrom this bow, more especially when the\ncolumns faded, broad patches of light flash\ned upward, frequently from its whsle length.\nThese flashes were at times given oil in such\nquick succession, as to present continued\n{ undulating light. About IL o'clock, the\narch and columns were gradually resolved\ninto homogeneous light. which continued\nTO send off flashes, and afterwards dlsap-\npeared by degrees without Offering any\nthing further worthy of notice.\n\n\nThe motion of the columns in the upper\n: arch was ALWAYS from East to West. They\nappeared very low in the atmosphere, and\none might readily have imagined them NOV\ned bv the wind. for when they first appear.\ned. an Eastcrly breeze sprang up, but soon\nfell. and at the same tiae the motion OF the\ny columns nearly ceased. But according te\nthe lowest calculations OF late writer's on the\n. sub;ect. the Aurora Boreals does not ap'\nproach nearer to tho Garth than 100 miles\n. rs ~. admit this the columns moved at the\nrate of more than three hundred miles in\nminutc-as they passed through quad\nrant Of a circle in about so seconds. The\nlight was mostly white, but had purpls\n\n\ntinge where brightest.\n\n\nThe inverted pyramid bore some analogy\nTO the zodiacal light. But it was not visible til\n\n\na hours after sunset, and its base was more\nthan 40 degrees from the ecliptic, though\nthe apex was nearly stationary in the place\nOf the SUMS setting, Whereas the zediaca\n\n\nlight, is seen or an hour after sunset, gen.\n\n\nerallv in the SUMS track, ard never without\nthe zodiac.\n\n\nThe evening of the 2sth was cool and ths\n\n\nsky perfectly clear.

Z. to the w. N. w. points of the\nhorizon; thongh diffused light, like the\nbreak Of day had been observed in the Aor-\nthern HORIZON during the previous half hour.\nThe zone or arch was midway between the\nzenith and horizon. and about 100 broad, ex-\ncept a. the western extremity, where it was\ncontracted nearly to point. Its Eastern cx-\ntremity was faint, uniform, intermitting\nlight. about its middle, slender streaks or\ncolumns became visible, converging towards\npoint far beyond the zenith, and moving\nlaterally from East to West. with the ra-\npidity of the lower stratum, of clouds in our\ncommon Easterly storus. These columns\nunderlined as they approached the West.\nwhere they appeared almost stationary\nThis appearance continued with little vara-\nton for three quarters of an hour. The\nEastern half Of the arch then disappeared\nentirely, and the remaining part approach\ned the zenith in the form Of a slender, in\nverted pyramid, and gave place to another\nOf half the width, composed of broader col\nunns, more distant, and well defined, NOV\ning but slowly, and presenting very s!nsu-\nlar and striking appearance. \"a supersti-\ntious eye would have construed every col\numn into sword, portending some dire ca\nlamity. The two semi. arches soon united,\nthe upper extremity disappeared. and the\nlower part formed into three long, slender\ncolumns, not unlike the tails of comets, very\nwe'll defined, overlapping each other, and\npointing south Of the zenith. These remain\ncd permanent half all hour. and then grad\nually mingled into one, which soon vanished\n\n\nAt this time III, o'clock) the phenome-\nnon was restricted to the light in the North,\nwhich had gradually becemc SO bright as to\ncast faint shadow, and had assumed the\nform of low rainbow, sending directly up\nwards long, slender luminous beams. which\nmoved in a lateral direction, backward and\nforward. and remained visible some minutes.\nFrom this bow, more especially when the\ncolumns faded, broad patches of light flash\ned upward, frequently from its whsle length.\nThese flashes were at times given oil in such\nquick succession, as to present continued\n{ undulating light. About IL o'clock, the\narch and columns were gradually resolved\ninto homogeneous light. which continued\nTO send off flashes, and afterwards dlsap-\npeared by degrees without Offering any\nthing further worthy of notice.\n\n\nThe motion of the columns in the upper\n: arch was ALWAYS from East to West. They\nappeared very low in the atmosphere, and\none might readily have imagined them NOV\ned bv the wind. for when they first appear.\ned. an Eastcrly breeze sprang up, but soon\nfell. and at the same tiae the motion OF the\ny columns nearly ceased. But according te\nthe lowest calculations OF late writer's on the\n. sub;ect. the Aurora Boreals does not ap'\nproach nearer to tho Garth than 100 miles\n. rs ~. admit this the columns moved at the\nrate of more than three hundred miles in\nminutc-as they passed through quad\nrant Of a circle in about so seconds. The\nlight was mostly white, but had purpls\n\n\ntinge where brightest.\n\n\nThe inverted pyramid bore some analogy\nTO the zodiacal light. But it was not visible til\n\n\na hours after sunset, and its base was more\nthan 40 degrees from the ecliptic, though\nthe apex was nearly stationary in the place\nOf the SUMS setting, Whereas the zediaca\n\n\nlight, is seen or an hour after sunset, gen.\n\n\nerallv in the SUMS track, ard never without\nthe zodiac.\n\n\nThe evening of the 2sth was cool and ths\n\n\nsky perfectly clear. The thermometer stooc\nAZ zoo and the Barometer at 29.SO inches\nA Northerly wind had prevailed for some\n!, d.vs and on the 26th there had been vio\na len, Easterly storm.\n!, In Cregory's Dict, article Aurora Boreal\nis. is a description by Dalton, nearly answer\ni, ing TO that Of the lower Bow. &c. but 1t\n\n\ndoubtful whether any account has been CIV\n>, en- of phenomenon similar to that first de\n;, scrib.d.
