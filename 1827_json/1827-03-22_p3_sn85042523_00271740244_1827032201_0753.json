In allusion to the proclamation OF\nthe President, the Editor Of the National\nJournal remarks:\n\n\n\"rhc law, it should seem, does not au-\nthorzc the President 70 issue his Proclama\nton to take effect prospectivcly; but such\nsteps will of course be taken by the cxecu-\ntive as candor and equity require in regard\nto such vessels as are now in port, or may\narrive in the United States without having\nreceived previous knowledge Of the presi-\ndents Proclamation.\n\n\nWe certainly could have wished that Con\ngross should have so left this matter as that\nthe British Government might have seen\ndistinctly, and in the form oflaw, the terms\non which the United States were willing TO\nopen the Colonial Trade TO both parties, and\nfull consideration Of those terms. AS Con\ngress, however, saw fit to pass no new law,\n\n\n\n\n\ncarry into execution such laws as do exist,\naccording to its sense Of duty The contin-\ngcncy provided forby existing laws has hap\npened, and Congress having risen without\naltering those laws nothing has remained\nto the Executive bat to give effect to those\n\n\nlaws, in conformity with their requirement.\n.\n\n\nOur advices from Portugal are favorable\nto the cause and success of the friends to\nthe Constitution. The rebel, or royal rrces,\nas they are called, have been dispersed, and\ntheir leader, the Marquis de Chavcs, on\nwhom their best hopes were founded, been\nput to aght-wounded and disgraced, he\nhas been compelled to seek an asylum in\nthe territory of the King Of Spain.

We believe that tranquil,\nity will shortly be restored by the Britisi\ntroops; but that it will be Of long duration\nis a thing quite improbable. The ambition\nof the priests, who arc determined to have\ntheir weight in the scale of all politica\nmeasures, will keep the people continually\nrestless, and plot after plot will be got VI\nby them, to overthrow the Constitutions\n,, Government.
