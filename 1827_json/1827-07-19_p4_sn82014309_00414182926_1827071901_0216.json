            "raw_text": "\n\n man may give that the habit ls coming over him with power. The signs he names are seven in number. of which we now copy the first. Boston Recorder\n\n One of the early indications of intemper- ance may be found in the associations of time and place. In the commencement of this e. vii habit there are many who drink to excess only on particular days, such as days for mil- itary exhibition, the anniversary of eur inde- pendence. the birth day of Washington, Christmas, new years day, election, and others of the like nature. When any of these holidays arrive. and they come as often al- most as saints days in the calendar. they bring with them to many the unsuitable de- sire of drinking as well as a dispensatiOn from the sin, as eficacious and quieting to the con- science, as papal indulgences.\n\n There are some am aware that have re- commended the multiplication of holidays and public amusementS, as a remedy for lntem- perance about as wise prescrptiOn-as the multiplying gambling houses to superscede gambling, pr the building of theatres to cor rect the evils of the stage.\n\n There are others who feel the desire of drinking stirred up within them by the asso- citations of place. They could go from end\n\n  its, were there nc tavern on the road. But the very sight of these resceptacles of pil- grims awakens the desire 'iust to step in and take something.\" And so powerful does the association become, that many will nO more pass tavern than they would pass a fortified place with all the engines of death directed against them. There are in every city, town and village, places of resort, which in like manner as soon as the eye falls upon them creates thirst of drinking, and many who coming to market on business, ,pass near them, pay toll there as regularly as they do at the gates and sometimes both when they come in and when they go out. In cities and their suburbs, there are hundreds of shops at which a large proportion of those who bring produce stop regularly to receive the customary bey- craze.\n\n In every community you may observe par ticular persons who can never meet without feeling the simultaneous desire of strong drink. What can be the reason of this ! All men, when they meet are not affected thus. 1t is not uncommon for men of similar em- ployment to be drawn by association, when they meet, to the same topics of conversation: physicians, upon the concerns of their pro- fession :-politicians, upon the events of the day :-and Christians when they meet, are drawn by common interest to speak of the kingdom of God. But this is upon the principle of a common interest in these sub- iects, which has no slight hold upon the thoughts and affections. Whoever then finds himself tempted on meeting his companion or friend to say, \"come and let us go and take something,' 2 or, to make it his first busi- ness to set out his decanter and glasses, ought to understand that he discloses his in- ordinate attachment to ardent spirits, and accuses his Friend of incompetence.\n\n Sympathy ofthe Heart.-There is curious thing with respect to the heart, showing its sympathies with the lungs. This is one of the curious experiments that have been made. If an animal be pithed,the medulla spinalis be divided high up, he dies; because the lungs want energy, and the diaphrGmatie nerve has its function abolished, and dies for want of breath. But let him be pithed and rcspira- ton kept up by mechanical means, the infa- tion kept up and life will go on. Now this is pair of bellows for drowned animals; he upon the lungs, for \"when l left off blowing my bellows, (said John the heart left of it's motion; and when began again to blow in-\n\n  action, at first feebly, but after little. more strongly I use the words exactly as Mir. Hunter uttered them. Now, trust all that nonsense is completely abolished: people say the cereJrum has no influence upon the heart but I say unquestiOnably, it has great influence upon it, and quote an instance to show it: suppose timid person, or deli cate female, hears noise in the middle of the night, which she supposes either to he a ghost ora robber egad, her pulsation falls, she gets cold and is so alarmed as to be al. most dead. Suppose fellow calls another person scoundrel ;-the person so called, feels his spirit rising, his face grows red, and he takes up his fist, and knocks the other down. Now, why such person as Bichat should point to the heart as the seat of feeling. and puts his other hand upon his| head to denote that it'sthe place of thought, don't know but his head had no thought init, think, when he talked such nonsense as that. You know that pleasant feelings do 1 produce pleasant action, as Shakespeare 1 said, ' my bosom's lord sits lightly on its thrOnc;\" and that uneasiness of mind has di- ] rectly the converse effect. It is therefore l certainly the effect of the cerebrum that acts ! upon these organs. wonder it had not en- tered into the wise head of some person to ar- | que that the diaphragm was not the seat of all these emotions. Shakespeare seems to me to have most sensibly felt these emotions Canst thou minister to a mind diseased ! l pinck rom the memory a rooted sorrow |",

            "article": "\n\n man may give that the habit ls coming over him with power. The signs he names are seven in number. of which we now copy the first. Boston Recorder\n\n One of the early indications of intemper- ance may be found in the associations of time and place. In the commencement of this e. vii habit there are many who drink to excess only on particular days, such as days for mil- itary exhibition, the anniversary of eur inde- pendence. the birth day of Washington, Christmas, new years day, election, and others of the like nature. When any of these holidays arrive. and they come as often al- most as saints days in the calendar. they bring with them to many the unsuitable de- sire of drinking as well as a dispensatiOn from the sin, as eficacious and quieting to the con- science, as papal indulgences.\n\n There are some am aware that have re- commended the multiplication of holidays and public amusementS, as a remedy for lntem- perance about as wise prescrptiOn-as the multiplying gambling houses to superscede gambling, pr the building of theatres to cor rect the evils of the stage.\n\n There are others who feel the desire of drinking stirred up within them by the asso- citations of place. They could go from end\n\n  its, were there nc tavern on the road. But the very sight of these resceptacles of pil- grims awakens the desire 'iust to step in and take something.\" And so powerful does the association become, that many will nO more pass tavern than they would pass a fortified place with all the engines of death directed against them. There are in every city, town and village, places of resort, which in like manner as soon as the eye falls upon them creates thirst of drinking, and many who coming to market on business, ,pass near them, pay toll there as regularly as they do at the gates and sometimes both when they come in and when they go out. In cities and their suburbs, there are hundreds of shops at which a large proportion of those who bring produce stop regularly to receive the customary bey- craze.\n\n In every community you may observe par ticular persons who can never meet without feeling the simultaneous desire of strong drink. What can be the reason of this ! All men, when they meet are not affected thus. 1t is not uncommon for men of similar em- ployment to be drawn by association, when they meet, to the same topics of conversation: physicians, upon the concerns of their pro- fession :-politicians, upon the events of the day :-and Christians when they meet, are drawn by common interest to speak of the kingdom of God. But this is upon the principle of a common interest in these sub- iects, which has no slight hold upon the thoughts and affections. Whoever then finds himself tempted on meeting his companion or friend to say, \"come and let us go and take something,' 2 or, to make it his first busi- ness to set out his decanter and glasses, ought to understand that he discloses his in- ordinate attachment to ardent spirits, and accuses his Friend of incompetence.\n\n Sympathy ofthe Heart.-There is curious thing with respect to the heart, showing its sympathies with the lungs. This is one of the curious experiments that have been made. If an animal be pithed,the medulla spinalis be divided high up, he dies; because the lungs want energy, and the diaphrGmatie nerve has its function abolished, and dies for want of breath. But let him be pithed and rcspira- ton kept up by mechanical means, the infa- tion kept up and life will go on. Now this is pair of bellows for drowned animals; he upon the lungs, for \"when l left off blowing my bellows, (said John the heart left of it's motion; and when began again to blow in-\n\n  action, at first feebly, but after little. more strongly I use the words exactly as Mir. Hunter uttered them. Now, trust all that nonsense is completely abolished: people say the cereJrum has no influence upon the heart but I say unquestiOnably, it has great influence upon it, and quote an instance to show it: suppose timid person, or deli cate female, hears noise in the middle of the night, which she supposes either to he a ghost ora robber egad, her pulsation falls, she gets cold and is so alarmed as to be al. most dead. Suppose fellow calls another person scoundrel ;-the person so called, feels his spirit rising, his face grows red, and he takes up his fist, and knocks the other down. Now, why such person as Bichat should point to the heart as the seat of feeling. and puts his other hand upon his| head to denote that it'sthe place of thought, don't know but his head had no thought init, think, when he talked such nonsense as that. You know that pleasant feelings do 1 produce pleasant action, as Shakespeare 1 said, ' my bosom's lord sits lightly on its thrOnc;\" and that uneasiness of mind has di- ] rectly the converse effect. It is therefore l certainly the effect of the cerebrum that acts ! upon these organs. wonder it had not en- tered into the wise head of some person to ar- | que that the diaphragm was not the seat of all these emotions. Shakespeare seems to me to have most sensibly felt these emotions Canst thou minister to a mind diseased ! l pinck rom the memory a rooted sorrow |",
