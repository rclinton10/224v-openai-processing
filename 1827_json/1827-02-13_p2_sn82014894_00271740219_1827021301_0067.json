We publish to-day the documents referred\nto In the Presidents Message published yesterday\nand The debate on the subject in the Senate. nc\ncourse pursued BY The President on this occasion\nis we conceive the proper one, and we have no douo\nil will meet the spproba.ion of the American people\ngenerally Its precisely the course we long since\n\n\nmd repeatedly, said was the only one which couio\nbe pursued, if Georgia persisted in her illJudget\nmeasures. A part Of the people OF Georgia VIII\nperhaps, declam loudly against the Executive\ntheir interest or rather hope o gain, Tor they nave\nnever invested one cent purchased an interest ~\nany manner whatever, in the Creek lands,-Deins\ndirectly involved. That our readers may unoer-\nstand the merits of he we VIII give pfiel MS\ntory OF the affair. The treaty OF the Indian springs\n(Which was anaulled by the treaty OF Washington\nceded 10 the United States for the use oil Georgia\nall the lands lying within the state OF Georgia be\nlonging 10 the Creeks and before that treaty was\nannulled, the Legislature Of Georgia passed la\"\nauthorizing the Governor to cause those lands TO DC\nsurveyed and distributed by lottery among the peo\npie OF fGeorgia.-The treaty oi the Indian springs\nheweyer was proved to have been obtained Dy un\n\n\nlair means, and new one was concluded at w ash\nington last winter, abrogating the torn'er cstao-\n\n\nshing the lines oil the lands which the Creeks oy u\nceded to the United States for the use OF Georgia\nand binding the United States to protect the Indians\nin the possession ot the lands retained by them.\n\n\nA small strip OF the Creek lands, il appears, with\n\n\nin the limits Of Geotgia, and which was ceded by\nThe treaty Of the Indian Springs, is not included 10\nthe lines of the new treaty. But even Georgia is\nnot cerain that these lands lie within her limits\nfor the line between her and Alabama is not esab-\nlshed, and un il is, she does no know but that\nthis same land may lie within the limits OF Alabama\nGovernor Troup. has oil along refused 10 acknow.\n\n\ncdgs the new treaty, and recently ordefed his sur\nseyors 10 proceed and survey the lands acquired\n{, orr the Greeks BY The new treaty, and also he\nstrip mentioned above. Those engaged in the sur\nyev Of tho latter portion were stopped and deprived\nOf their instruments by the Indians, as stated in The\nPs,ro. several days since, and IT IS ior this act and\nagainst these survey that the President has nsti\n\n\ntuted the proceedings II II be admitted that trea\nties are pat, Of the \"supreme law Of the land,\nand that ,he powers tina, can make, can sbrogste\nhem and il il be admitted, that, the President o.\nthe United States is bound by duty the people, and\nhi, oath OF Office.
