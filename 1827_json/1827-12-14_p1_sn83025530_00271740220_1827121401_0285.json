Let US examine them\nseverally.\n\n\nlst accusation: ssAdams, it is said, has been\nmade president against the will OF the people Jack\nson the choice of the people\"\n\n\nIn state where the people had no part in the\nformation of the constitution, it might be possible\nthat election made similar to the election OF John\nQuincy Adams, would be considered as made against\nthe will of the people. Yet, even, then, we should\nthink that it was necessary that majority OF the\npeople should declare, not only against him, but IN\nfavor of one of his competitors. But IN repub-\nlie, such as ours where all powers derived from\nthe people, where the constitution is the work OF\ntheir special manufactures, instructed to form 1t for\n\n\nthem it is neither Just nor reasonable to assert, that\nsuch AN election as that of John Quincy Adams has\n\n\nbeen made against their will. Was it not the Peo-\nPile themselves who required, that when no candl-\ndate had the absolute orty OF votes IN the elec-\n\n\ntoral college, the house of representatives should\nchoose, from the three who had obtained the great.\n\n\nest number. TO say, that in each case, the person\n\n\nchosen is chosen against the will of the people, be-\n\n\n\n\n\ndoes it not render nugatory the provision OF the\n\n\nconstitution, which delegates to the house OF repre-\n\n\nsentatyes the choice, when no candidate has an abb\n\n\nsolute majority ?lf the people had wished that the\n\n\ncandidate who should have the relative majority\n: should be elected, would they in such case have\n\n\ntransferred the right of choice to their representa-\n\n\ntiyes? And the right to make choice would 1t not\n\n\nbe mockery, if the candidate who had the most\n\n\nsufrages must necessarily be elected, to comply\n\n\nH. en- How bp In\n\n\nhas only the relative majority Of electoral votes, be\n\n\nmore considered as the choice Of the people, than\nhe who having fewer of these sudrages, has IN his\n\n\nfavor the majority of the house OF representatives\n/ What are those electors? Are they other than the\n\n\nsimple organs of the will of the people And the\n\n\nrepresentatives are they not also the organs and\n\n\nInterpreters Of the will of the people?\n\n\nBut further, in establishing the real proportion,\nbetween the electoral votes which ea-h candidate\nhas received, and the votes which have been given\n\n\nin each State it is proved, that Adams had SO l-69\nvotes Jackson had but sc 1-83; Crawford AZ l-23;\nand Clay 27 l-7O. This calculation, made and\n\n\npublished since the 29th January, 1928. IN the Ma\n\n\ntonal Journal and the correctness and exactitude oil\nwhich has neverb been contested ndisputaby proves,\n\n\nthat it is Adams, and not Jackson, who is what the\nopposition is pleased to call the real candidate oihe\n; people,\n: cd accusation :--\"Adams has been raised to the\n: presidency by bribery and corruption\"\n. This caunnious proposition, advanced and re-\npeated by 80 many Interested echos, IN all parts o\nthe United States, for more than two years and 9\ni half had been Justly appreciated since the moment\nt it was denied by the Secretary Of stae upon whom\nJ. was evident they endeavored more particularly t\nrest the odi0us weight. But il, after the inextrica\n9 BILE dilemma in which this able orator had put the\nman from whom the calumny proceeded there re\ni NAMED any doubts in the mind of any honest citizen\nfho nf Mr. ISuc tied\ns. ing witness by these hardy accusers, has forever\n/ disspated them and since then, no man who re\nCARDS his reputation, or the justice OF the peo\npie, as much he ought to deest all odlous perse\n!. cution will allow himself to repeat this accusation\nJ, TThe 3rd accusation relates to his recommenda\n\" ton of an Observatory the fourth to the establish\n= nent OF an University in the District OF Columbia\ny y the fifth to his being IN favor OF internal improve\n\" men the sixth to his opposition to the acquisition\nY of Louisiana the seventh-hs having voted for\nq q or not opposing the passage of law which tool\n= from them all their rights TO the vacant lands-Now\n= the 3d. 4th and 5th of these accusations, the Con\n~ =, vention commend--showng that these recommen\n- dations ofhe President not only good in them\nI; selves, but agreeably to the recommendations o\n:, : his predecessors.

No: this opposition did\n\n\nnot blush to assert. that they wished to put out all\n\n\nthe members of the new administration, right or\n\n\nwrong. and were they 'as pure as the angels OF hea\n\n\nven \" aud in the delirum Of their raging fever, what\ndid they not atempta Every one knows that. at\n\n\nthe last presidential election of all the candidates\nfor the presidency, one had obtained Of the peo-\n\n\npie. or Of the electoral college, the majority regur-\n\n\ned by the constitution: Jackson had in his favour the\n/, votes 90 eectors Adams 81; Crawford Al; Clay 81\n3 In this state of things, it became the duty of the\n;, house of representatives, to make choce among\n\n\nthe three highest candidates, as required by the con\n\n\nstitution; and in the performance Of this consttu\nh tona duty, the house determined in favor of Johr\nIs Quincy Adams. The opposition, composed OF dit\na erent materials who found themselves obliged IL\nh renounce the brilliant hopes they had severally in\n70 dulged in, and rritated with result SO dheren\n~ from what each had promised hlmsef; this opposi\n\n\nton pretended to find in the constitution, until nov\n= considered perfect, radical defect, to which alon\n\n\nthey attributed the i'll success of the disappointed\n\n\ncandidate. From that time they dreamed OF moth\n= ing but an amendment to the constitutions and du\nal ring thirds of the ensuing session OF congress\na unhappily celebrated, thev made the most astonsh\nMt ing efforts to amend it, They endeavoured to abrc\n\n\n,l tho hong nf\n\" representatives. the right, in the exercise ot which\nhad declared, of three candidates balotted tor tina\n\n\nAdams was the most worthy.

Let US examine them\nseverally.\n\n\nlst accusation: ssAdams, it is said, has been\nmade president against the will OF the people Jack\nson the choice of the people\"\n\n\nIn state where the people had no part in the\nformation of the constitution, it might be possible\nthat election made similar to the election OF John\nQuincy Adams, would be considered as made against\nthe will of the people. Yet, even, then, we should\nthink that it was necessary that majority OF the\npeople should declare, not only against him, but IN\nfavor of one of his competitors. But IN repub-\nlie, such as ours where all powers derived from\nthe people, where the constitution is the work OF\ntheir special manufactures, instructed to form 1t for\n\n\nthem it is neither Just nor reasonable to assert, that\nsuch AN election as that of John Quincy Adams has\n\n\nbeen made against their will. Was it not the Peo-\nPile themselves who required, that when no candl-\ndate had the absolute orty OF votes IN the elec-\n\n\ntoral college, the house of representatives should\nchoose, from the three who had obtained the great.\n\n\nest number. TO say, that in each case, the person\n\n\nchosen is chosen against the will of the people, be-\n\n\n\n\n\ndoes it not render nugatory the provision OF the\n\n\nconstitution, which delegates to the house OF repre-\n\n\nsentatyes the choice, when no candidate has an abb\n\n\nsolute majority ?lf the people had wished that the\n\n\ncandidate who should have the relative majority\n: should be elected, would they in such case have\n\n\ntransferred the right of choice to their representa-\n\n\ntiyes? And the right to make choice would 1t not\n\n\nbe mockery, if the candidate who had the most\n\n\nsufrages must necessarily be elected, to comply\n\n\nH. en- How bp In\n\n\nhas only the relative majority Of electoral votes, be\n\n\nmore considered as the choice Of the people, than\nhe who having fewer of these sudrages, has IN his\n\n\nfavor the majority of the house OF representatives\n/ What are those electors? Are they other than the\n\n\nsimple organs of the will of the people And the\n\n\nrepresentatives are they not also the organs and\n\n\nInterpreters Of the will of the people?\n\n\nBut further, in establishing the real proportion,\nbetween the electoral votes which ea-h candidate\nhas received, and the votes which have been given\n\n\nin each State it is proved, that Adams had SO l-69\nvotes Jackson had but sc 1-83; Crawford AZ l-23;\nand Clay 27 l-7O.
