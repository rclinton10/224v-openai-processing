It VIII be\nseen that Havana has the means of making\nmost powerful resistance against any invaa-\ner, should there be internal peace and mar\nmony. .o\nyr There are in and about Havana, 750o\ntroons all of whom have been sent from\nSpain. They are well ted, clothed ana uls-\ncinlincd. they receive l. dollars per month\nfor wages. from which are usually deducted\nabout three dollars for their uniform, &c\nThey have beet sent from Spain Tor various\ncauses, some because they are faithful, ana\nsome because they had fought tor the CON\nstituton. The first year OF their arrival\nthey are usually subject to the fever, and no\nsmall number fall thus sacrificed. Spain,\nhowever, must have Spanish soldiers, as she\ncan never trust the islanders; and 1t feid-\nnand has discontinued regiment, Cuba at\nfords good place for tomb Its suppos-\ncd that &C, 900 soldiers might be raised IN\nthe island, in case of union and emergency.\nBut so great is the apprehension OF the GO\nvernment towards the natives, that durIass\nthe past winter, it was found necessary 10\nsend large body of troops from Havana to\nMantanzas, because they were commanded\nby Cuban officers.\n\n\nThe troops parade every day, either IN the\nPlaza de Armas or eatramdroS her com\nmon dress is white coarse linen, with black\ncloth cap and yellow tassels.

OF the\nUnited States Navy, told me that he never\nsaw finer troops, nor did he think It possible\nto drill men more perfectly. some OF the\nother officers found, did not concur entirely\nwith the Commodore, as to their ability to\nwithstand a charge of a British force Of G.\nquail number; inasmuch as 10 mass, they\nare not as stout men as the latter.\n\n\nAS to the ability of a foreign power TO\ntake Havana, there is great difference OF\nopinion. The troops which occupy It hay\ning been sent away from their own country\nagainst their will. might, in case OF an in\nsurrection, either join with the rebels, or,\nIf a foreign power should come, might Gre\nate such discomfort, as to render the efforts\nof their officers unavailing. II IN addition\nto this, the distraction and jealousy oi the\nnatives be considered, it viii appear possl.\nble, that without much expense, either OF\ntreasure or blood, Havana might fall. The\nCabana being commanded by ali eminence\nwithin distance, might possibly be taken,\nand then the Moro must fall, as well as the\nother fortresses The walls OF the city\nwould be no protection, as the houses oht-\naide would completely shelter the approach\nOF besegers.
