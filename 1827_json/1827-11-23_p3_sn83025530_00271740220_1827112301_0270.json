The\nArgument proceeds. % To suit his theory to his\n\"practse, the President claims almost bouudess\n\n\n6 authority for the executive; elects the Senate\n- from all participation in the institution OF embas-\n' sizes and the commissioning Of ENJOYS; compares\n\"he influence OF the constituent on the representa-\n\" tive to the effect of paralysis on the human body; in\ni\" the true spirit Of arbitrary condescenson, he dis\nplays to the nation antastical projects Of beneac-\ni\" ton and improvement, benetting the gracious king\n\n\nOf stargazng subjects, rather than the responsible\n{\" agent of free people\" Such, Reader, is the\nlanguage of one of the legislatures of this union, rel\native 10 the administration! An administration whose\nwhole object :. both at the first and now, was, and\n\n\nis\" the nations happiness and prosperity, and most\nconscentiously do we believe, that these same mem\nbers of the Tennessee Legislature in their hearts\nbelieve it, and would join US saying so were not\nfor unhallowed prejudice in favor OF man--of\n\"mtary chetiain 'rhe tree is known by fruit -\nas the god of the Tennessee Legislature would say,\nand ifso, what is the that bears such delicious\nfruit to this nation, the present most happy con-\ndon of the people, and the prosperity and glory of\nthe United States, which has been surpassed,\nin any country at any time The talsehoods.

Mr.. Adams has never in\nstitu,ed embassies, nor commissioned ENJOYS. during\nthe sitting of the Senate without the Senate's sane\nton; could he do it, if so disposed, for the\nHouse of Representatives well as the Senate\ncould interpose their vote by Withholding the ap-\npreparations necessary 10 carry them into effect\nThis most ridiculous and untounded charge is based\n\n\nupon an expression of the President in his first mes\n, sage to Congress, in which he says,-speaklng o.\nthe invitation given by the South American Repub\nlies to this government, to Cause itself to be repre-\nsented at the proposed congress OF Panama.\" TIT\ninvitation has been accepted and ministers will bt\ncommissioned\" Now what Can the most iastidious\ni even the members of the Tennessee legislature\ni make out of this Nothing, absolutely nothing. Th'\nPresident merely meant to convey the idea, that, 81\ni far as the Executive department OF the government\n\n\nwas concerned, the invitation was accepted, and s.\nfar as it was the province Of the Executive, minis\nq ters would be commissioned. To prove that thu\nII was his meaning, let refer to his proceedings\n\n\n\n\n\n+ more than to appoint the ambassadors and to apprt\nss pirate money for the support Of the embassy.\n10 the case of the Panama mission Mr.. Adams, IN tt\nu usual way, nominated ministers and asked the Seno\nW for ats advice and consent as to their appontmen\nre Further when the Senate had advised and consen\nr. ed to the appointment, he, by special message su\nW gested the propriety OF making All appropriation II\n~ the support of the embassy to the House OF Repr\npe sentatiyes-the whole OF which proceedings are\nwith tha hPcP\n\n\nare known to Hll and this course has been pursue\n\n\nby the President in every instance. He could n\n\n\npursue any other if he would How then has I\n\n\nPresident \" \"ejected the Senate from all participate\nin the institution of embassies, and the conmlssle\n,S- ing of envoys?'
