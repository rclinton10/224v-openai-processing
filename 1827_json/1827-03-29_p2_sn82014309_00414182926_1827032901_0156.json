The re- suit of this experiment has satisfied my mind that as long as we submit to the dictation of a legislative caucus, we shall never see the ac- cOmpIishment of the object of distrcting the State; an object which in times past has ex- cited more feelings of genuine repuhlicanism in its favour, than any other which has agita- ted the public mind since parties have existed in Connecticut.\n\n With respect to the ticket for members of l Congress I might use the same reasons for giving it a preference. fla change is required in the senate the same change seems necessa- \" in the other offices. have not the pleas ! ure to know many. of the gentlemen on that ticket, but the manner in which their names are placed before the public affords good evil dence that they have the confidence of those l who know them best. & that they afe worthy of the places they are noplinated to fill. In ref crence, however, to the candidates from our own county, it seems to me that there can be but one opinion in relation to their merits, and the very manner in which the nomination of Mir.

Have we become so abiect as that we dare not \"tiIink our own thoughts or 1 do our own deeds' in reference to matters which concern ourselves and ourselves alone But nominations aside, if We consider the merits of. the respective candidates it would\n\n seem that there could be but little doubt on\n\n whom the choice would fall. Mir. Merwin\n\n has long been known as a firm, consistent, and\n\n intelligent republican, not in favor of rash and violent measures, not given to the indulgence of strong party feelings, not disposed to sweep away with an unsparing prescription all who may happen to differ with him in sentiment\n\n and not one who fingered in the federal ranks till there was certainty of the speedy ascen- \n\n | former friends to their fate, making the best of his way intethe ranks of Federation; such is not MT. Merwin.-But on the other hand\n\n tho in the darkest days of Federalism he was never afraid to avow his preference of rcpub- lican principles, he has since his party came into power been disting'i. he'd for the calmness of his feelings and the cool and dispassionate course he has pursued He is also respecta-\n\n ble member of Congress, and though his course of life has not leG him to take part in the pub\n\n lie debates in any considerable degree, yet he\n\n is known to weigh such subjects as come be-\n\n fore Congress for their decision with sound sense and good judgment, and his recorded votes will testify that his course has been such as the best interest of his constituents seemed 1 to require.-And who is his competitor? He is a man whom the change of politics has brought into some notice in the state, and who as long as the caucus has the ascendancy ] will continue to have some influence in the d- rectson of public sentiment. But he has never been distinguished for legislative talents, such as eloquence in debate or solidity or correct ness of Judgment. Nor h IS he been much distinguished for consistency and frmness in his political course. He is in fact one of those men whom political revolution will always bring into notice, but who when the excitement which produced their temporary elevation has passed away will he forgotten. Nor do think he has any further claim upon the party as a reward for his apostacy from federalism. A seat in Congress during four sessions, one would think, is a full compensation for all the good he has done the party; and as his con- gressional life was not distinguished by any great performance except his hostility to the appropriation made to Gen. Lafayette. it is not believed he would render his name i'm mortal if he should be again elected.\n\n Under every view in which can place the merits of the candidates must give my deci- ded preference to MT.

THE WOLF AND THE FOX :--4 F'd5le.\n\n Some thirty years ago, a WoIfw a large family, lived in the vicinity ofa Fox, with a progeny equally numerous; and were joint tenants of considerable territory, through which they roamed with entire freedom in the pursuit of game. For time the two families went on with good degree of har- 'nony but causes of difficulty arose, by which they gradually became estranged; till at length they broke out into violent quar- rel. The chief ground of dispute between l them, wasthe division Of the prey; in relation to which, they were mutually jealous; and were, contra pacem, guilty of cel tain rash pro- ceedings, which all discreet persons (whether bibed or quadrnped,) disapprove. Pretty soon, however. after they commenced the bu- sin\"ss of \"trying which could do the other the most harm,\" the Wolf, being by nature a more powerful and ferocious animal than his antagonist, obtained the mastery, and got the control of the whole territory; so that the unhappy Fox was obliged to scnd for his life. The Wolfcontinuedt to enjoy the victory for number of years, and greatly tyrannized 0, CT the Fox, denying him a participation i the products of the field ;-so that it was ex- treme'y difficult for the family of the latter to ! subsist, being compelled to resort to all the little arts and chicanery of their nature, to ob- 1 tain the common necessaries. During the I continuance of the It Sn of MT. Wolf, his 1 neighbour Fox suggested that their territory should be distyicteL; and that suitable ror- ] tions of it should be assigned to each family, so that they might reap the advantages to which they were respectively entitled. INis, MT. Fox said. was reasonable ard just; and that although Wolf had the mastery, yet his family was large, and it was not right to com pei him to commit petit larceny every time he wished to pick geose's wing. Fox made sundry very earnest applications on this i,- teresting subject: his appeals were frequent; his entreaties importunale; and every time he preferred petition, he took especial care to add the emphatic words, ''as in duty bound your orator will euer pray\" But to all the eloquence of Fox on this interesting subject, that arstocratic parsonage, Sir Nicolas Wolf, replied m scripture phraseo!ogy, nay, nay ;- possession is equivalent to nine points of law and whatever game there may be found in these regions is destined exclusively for my capacious maw. The project of districtng the territory, however, was more especially resisted by certain bitter individuals in the Wolf family, who were so greedy that they could not consent to see others participate in the spoil. Constantly traducing neighbour Fox. they stirred up the most violent conten- ton, and were the sole authors of many fla grant acts of injustice, committed upon the unoffending members of his family. The lat ter, however, in the mean time, impcrceptibly gained strength of which their adversaries, resting in presumptuous security, were not",

Hence in our had prominent place, and the propriety of adopting it was urged with an earnestness commensurate with it's importance.\n\n In the address of the General Committee of the Republicans, dated Aug. sOth, 1903, spea- king with reference to the innovations\" if such they may be called, which Republicans, \"have at heart,' they use the following lan- guage:\n\n \"THEY WOULD DIVIDE TIE STATE INTO DISTRICTS, FOR THE ELECTION OF COUNCIL LORs AND OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS-\"\n\n In the Oration of Mr. Abraham Bishop, de- livered on the lth of May, 1904, and pur- porting to be printed for the General Com mittee of Republicans, he thus expresses him. self:-\n\n For the remedy of all these evils in our '' State Government, we propose that the \"people shall be convened, to form consti- tuition which shall separate the legislative, \"executve and judicial powers-shall define \"the qualifications offreemen, so that Legis- \"latOrs shall not tamper with election laws, \"and SHALL DISTRICT THE STATE, SO THAT \"FREEMEN MAY JUDGE OF THE CANDIDATES \"FOR THEIR sUFFRAGEs.\"\n\n A due regard to constituency in matters of political faith, has ever been a leading trait in the character of Republicans. It should nev- CT be lost sight of. The same reasons which existed more than twenty years ago, why the system of DIsTRICTING should be adop- ted, exist at the present time with undimin- ished force :--and ought we to give further occasion to our political adversaries, to re- proach us for vacillating policy Do we not justly expose ourselves to the sarcasms of all candid men, for advocating doctrine, when striving for power, which we practical iy condemn, when we have acquired it - Will our children, who are hereafter to take our places in the Republican family, believe that we were honest in our opposition to the aristocracy of Federalism, when they find us abandoning fundamental principle, which we once strenuously advocated? Will they have no reason to think that we prefer enjoy ing the loaves and fshes,\" even if it is at the expense of sacrificing one of the articles of our political creed?\n\n It is not, however, merely the respect which IS due to consistency in political opinions, that demands of us adherence to our former pro- fessions. The radical evils which attend the system of electing our officers by General Ticket, and the obvious advantages of that by DISTRICTS, ought to furnish sufficient motives for an immediate substitution of the latter for the former mode. In this way only, can the PEOPLE be said practically to exercise the right of suffrage sin this way only can Le. gislative Cancusses be abolished; and in this way alone can the Electors have the best means Of ascertaining the qualifications of can dldates for the offices for which they are ua- med.\n\n !cannot omit also to remark. that no pos- sihie danger need be apprehended to the per manency ofthe Republican Administration, of the State, by choosing our Senators and Rep resentatives in Congress. by DIsrR,crs. The Rame of Fsderalist, Is almost unknown amon~ us:--as a party, it is disheartened and dis. banded. An overwhelming majority of inc electors of Connecticut are Repxblicans. and any fair mode of dividing the State into Dis rRICTs, will always ensure the election, if not of Gl, of a great majority, who are firm friends and supporters of the policy of the present Administration of this State.",

It seems that the hon. est and respectable part of the community have become tired of the domination of King Caucus, and have come to the resolution to bestir themselves, and to assert their rights. It will he determined at this election whether his majesty shall rivet more closely the chains of his despotism, Or whether the electors shall be left 90 follow the dictates of their own un- biased judgment in the choice of those who shall govern then.-This election therefore cannot be viewed with indifference by any re- publican who has desire to see, in the calm and dset;led ascendancy of his party, the pre- l yalence of the mild influence of genuine re- publicanism, or who has any wish to promote 1 the welfare at large.-Itis is under the influence of these considerations that have determin- ed to assign a few of the reasons which in my opinion give a decided preference to the tick ct which the friends of Districting have laid before the electors f, their snpport.-And in doing this hope shall not incur the displca- sure of any gentleman who is on the caucus ticket, and trust there will not be imputed to me any sinister or selfish motives. l hold no ofice-I desire no ofice-I am perfectly will ling that those who have time and talents and honesty to devote to the services ofthe pub lie, should avail themselves of the pleasure & the profit, which result from the faithful dis charge of the duties of public life. But con- fess that am unwilling that few ambitious and designing men, apostate federalists, who have nothing to recommend them but a |\" zeal l which is not according to knowledge = zeal which is exercised more to retain power in their own hands, than to dispense the blessings of an upright and benignant administrat ton of the government to all classes of life zeal which exercises the same rigour of proscrip ton against the honest republican who dares to advocate measures which have long formed the fundamental creed of his party, as against the most decided and determined federalist I say am unwilling that such men should any longer have it in their power to do so much mischief and to bring so much disgrace upon the party.\n\n In looking over the two tickets which are presented to the choice ofthe Electors, it ap- pears to me that that which has been denom- ! mated the '' Republican District IIcket,\" has\n\n \n\n now to the ticket for Senators.\n\n l It has the preference in respec: to the weight of talents. There are several gentlemen up | on it, whose influence in the Senatorial body would give it a responsibility which it has not for several years possessed. Why is 1t that l the Senate of this state has so long been re- l garded as mere cypher in legislation Why is it that nothing has ever been heard of their proceedings, unless it was the rejection of some appointment which the lower house had made of some honest and capable man, and | the substitution ofsome other person less quail flied in his room It is because there has not ] been men in the senate chamber who are qualified for that station, and men whom it is in the power of the republican party to place there.\n\n Again.-The District ticket has the prefer ence in respect to the manner in which the nominations are made out. It is in fact the peoples ticket. It has been agreed upon in the primary assemblies of the electors. The gentlemen upon it are well known to those who have presented their names to the pub lie; whereas the caucus ticket is made out by very small minority of the republican mem bers of the assembly (the greater part having become disgusted with this method of making nOminations,) and is the result of the l,bours of whole session spent in bargaining and ill- triguing for office, instead of being engaged in the business upon which they were sent.\n\n Another reason for which give the per ference to the District Ticket is, that if it is elected, the consequence will he the adoption of a measure which has ever been prime ob- ject with all genuine republicans. refer to the subject of Districting the State for the choice of Senators and members of Congress. The neglect of the federal party, when in power, to do this, was the subject of more animadver- sion for the then minority than any other. It ] is what republicans. q mean such as were not afraid to call themselves by that name when federalism was in it's full strength,) have al- ways been solicitous to procure done and what they expected to see accomplished without delay when their party came into power.-l For some unaccountable reason which have never been able to understand, it was not done when the constitution was adopted. But the people have ever since submitted to the rule of the 4 powers that be-\" under the repeated promise that the object should be accomplish ed in due time; that as soon as party feelings should subsde and a \"calm and settled mod eratiOn\" should rest upon the community the State should be districted for the purposes above mentioned, and thus very fav0urite object of the democratic party should be brought about.-Now l ask you to mark the result of the measures which have been taken ",

The re- suit of this experiment has satisfied my mind that as long as we submit to the dictation of a legislative caucus, we shall never see the ac- cOmpIishment of the object of distrcting the State; an object which in times past has ex- cited more feelings of genuine repuhlicanism in its favour, than any other which has agita- ted the public mind since parties have existed in Connecticut.\n\n With respect to the ticket for members of l Congress I might use the same reasons for giving it a preference. fla change is required in the senate the same change seems necessa- \" in the other offices. have not the pleas ! ure to know many. of the gentlemen on that ticket, but the manner in which their names are placed before the public affords good evil dence that they have the confidence of those l who know them best. & that they afe worthy of the places they are noplinated to fill.

Mir. Merwin\n\n has long been known as a firm, consistent, and\n\n intelligent republican, not in favor of rash and violent measures, not given to the indulgence of strong party feelings, not disposed to sweep away with an unsparing prescription all who may happen to differ with him in sentiment\n\n and not one who fingered in the federal ranks till there was certainty of the speedy ascen- \n\n | former friends to their fate, making the best of his way intethe ranks of Federation; such is not MT. Merwin.-But on the other hand\n\n tho in the darkest days of Federalism he was never afraid to avow his preference of rcpub- lican principles, he has since his party came into power been disting'i. he'd for the calmness of his feelings and the cool and dispassionate course he has pursued He is also respecta-\n\n ble member of Congress, and though his course of life has not leG him to take part in the pub\n\n lie debates in any considerable degree, yet he\n\n is known to weigh such subjects as come be-\n\n fore Congress for their decision with sound sense and good judgment, and his recorded votes will testify that his course has been such as the best interest of his constituents seemed 1 to require.-And who is his competitor? He is a man whom the change of politics has brought into some notice in the state, and who as long as the caucus has the ascendancy ] will continue to have some influence in the d- rectson of public sentiment. But he has never been distinguished for legislative talents, such as eloquence in debate or solidity or correct ness of Judgment. Nor h IS he been much distinguished for consistency and frmness in his political course. He is in fact one of those men whom political revolution will always bring into notice, but who when the excitement which produced their temporary elevation has passed away will he forgotten. Nor do think he has any further claim upon the party as a reward for his apostacy from federalism. A seat in Congress during four sessions, one would think, is a full compensation for all the good he has done the party; and as his con- gressional life was not distinguished by any great performance except his hostility to the appropriation made to Gen. Lafayette. it is not believed he would render his name i'm mortal if he should be again elected.\n\n Under every view in which can place the merits of the candidates must give my deci- ded preference to MT. Merwin.

Pretty soon, however. after they commenced the bu- sin\"ss of \"trying which could do the other the most harm,\" the Wolf, being by nature a more powerful and ferocious animal than his antagonist, obtained the mastery, and got the control of the whole territory; so that the unhappy Fox was obliged to scnd for his life. The Wolfcontinuedt to enjoy the victory for number of years, and greatly tyrannized 0, CT the Fox, denying him a participation i the products of the field ;-so that it was ex- treme'y difficult for the family of the latter to ! subsist, being compelled to resort to all the little arts and chicanery of their nature, to ob- 1 tain the common necessaries. During the I continuance of the It Sn of MT. Wolf, his 1 neighbour Fox suggested that their territory should be distyicteL; and that suitable ror- ] tions of it should be assigned to each family, so that they might reap the advantages to which they were respectively entitled. INis, MT. Fox said. was reasonable ard just; and that although Wolf had the mastery, yet his family was large, and it was not right to com pei him to commit petit larceny every time he wished to pick geose's wing. Fox made sundry very earnest applications on this i,- teresting subject: his appeals were frequent; his entreaties importunale; and every time he preferred petition, he took especial care to add the emphatic words, ''as in duty bound your orator will euer pray\" But to all the eloquence of Fox on this interesting subject, that arstocratic parsonage, Sir Nicolas Wolf, replied m scripture phraseo!ogy, nay, nay ;- possession is equivalent to nine points of law and whatever game there may be found in these regions is destined exclusively for my capacious maw. The project of districtng the territory, however, was more especially resisted by certain bitter individuals in the Wolf family, who were so greedy that they could not consent to see others participate in the spoil. Constantly traducing neighbour Fox. they stirred up the most violent conten- ton, and were the sole authors of many fla grant acts of injustice, committed upon the unoffending members of his family. The lat ter, however, in the mean time, impcrceptibly gained strength of which their adversaries, resting in presumptuous security, were not",

Hence in our had prominent place, and the propriety of adopting it was urged with an earnestness commensurate with it's importance.\n\n In the address of the General Committee of the Republicans, dated Aug. sOth, 1903, spea- king with reference to the innovations\" if such they may be called, which Republicans, \"have at heart,' they use the following lan- guage:\n\n \"THEY WOULD DIVIDE TIE STATE INTO DISTRICTS, FOR THE ELECTION OF COUNCIL LORs AND OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS-\"\n\n In the Oration of Mr. Abraham Bishop, de- livered on the lth of May, 1904, and pur- porting to be printed for the General Com mittee of Republicans, he thus expresses him. self:-\n\n For the remedy of all these evils in our '' State Government, we propose that the \"people shall be convened, to form consti- tuition which shall separate the legislative, \"executve and judicial powers-shall define \"the qualifications offreemen, so that Legis- \"latOrs shall not tamper with election laws, \"and SHALL DISTRICT THE STATE, SO THAT \"FREEMEN MAY JUDGE OF THE CANDIDATES \"FOR THEIR sUFFRAGEs.\"\n\n A due regard to constituency in matters of political faith, has ever been a leading trait in the character of Republicans. It should nev- CT be lost sight of. The same reasons which existed more than twenty years ago, why the system of DIsTRICTING should be adop- ted, exist at the present time with undimin- ished force :--and ought we to give further occasion to our political adversaries, to re- proach us for vacillating policy Do we not justly expose ourselves to the sarcasms of all candid men, for advocating doctrine, when striving for power, which we practical iy condemn, when we have acquired it - Will our children, who are hereafter to take our places in the Republican family, believe that we were honest in our opposition to the aristocracy of Federalism, when they find us abandoning fundamental principle, which we once strenuously advocated? Will they have no reason to think that we prefer enjoy ing the loaves and fshes,\" even if it is at the expense of sacrificing one of the articles of our political creed?\n\n It is not, however, merely the respect which IS due to consistency in political opinions, that demands of us adherence to our former pro- fessions. The radical evils which attend the system of electing our officers by General Ticket, and the obvious advantages of that by DISTRICTS, ought to furnish sufficient motives for an immediate substitution of the latter for the former mode. In this way only, can the PEOPLE be said practically to exercise the right of suffrage sin this way only can Le. gislative Cancusses be abolished; and in this way alone can the Electors have the best means Of ascertaining the qualifications of can dldates for the offices for which they are ua- med.\n\n !cannot omit also to remark. that no pos- sihie danger need be apprehended to the per manency ofthe Republican Administration, of the State, by choosing our Senators and Rep resentatives in Congress. by DIsrR,crs. The Rame of Fsderalist, Is almost unknown amon~ us:--as a party, it is disheartened and dis. banded. An overwhelming majority of inc electors of Connecticut are Repxblicans. and any fair mode of dividing the State into Dis rRICTs, will always ensure the election, if not of Gl, of a great majority, who are firm friends and supporters of the policy of the present Administration of this State.",

            "article": " TO THE REPUBLICAN ELECTORS\n\n OF LITCHFlELD COUNTY.\n\n The approaching election is one of more than ordinary interest. It seems that the hon. est and respectable part of the community have become tired of the domination of King Caucus, and have come to the resolution to bestir themselves, and to assert their rights. It will he determined at this election whether his majesty shall rivet more closely the chains of his despotism, Or whether the electors shall be left 90 follow the dictates of their own un- biased judgment in the choice of those who shall govern then.-This election therefore cannot be viewed with indifference by any re- publican who has desire to see, in the calm and dset;led ascendancy of his party, the pre- l yalence of the mild influence of genuine re- publicanism, or who has any wish to promote 1 the welfare at large.-Itis is under the influence of these considerations that have determin- ed to assign a few of the reasons which in my opinion give a decided preference to the tick ct which the friends of Districting have laid before the electors f, their snpport.-And in doing this hope shall not incur the displca- sure of any gentleman who is on the caucus ticket, and trust there will not be imputed to me any sinister or selfish motives. l hold no ofice-I desire no ofice-I am perfectly will ling that those who have time and talents and honesty to devote to the services ofthe pub lie, should avail themselves of the pleasure & the profit, which result from the faithful dis charge of the duties of public life. But con- fess that am unwilling that few ambitious and designing men, apostate federalists, who have nothing to recommend them but a |\" zeal l which is not according to knowledge = zeal which is exercised more to retain power in their own hands, than to dispense the blessings of an upright and benignant administrat ton of the government to all classes of life zeal which exercises the same rigour of proscrip ton against the honest republican who dares to advocate measures which have long formed the fundamental creed of his party, as against the most decided and determined federalist I say am unwilling that such men should any longer have it in their power to do so much mischief and to bring so much disgrace upon the party.\n\n In looking over the two tickets which are presented to the choice ofthe Electors, it ap- pears to me that that which has been denom- ! mated the '' Republican District IIcket,\" has\n\n \n\n now to the ticket for Senators.\n\n l It has the preference in respec: to the weight of talents. There are several gentlemen up | on it, whose influence in the Senatorial body would give it a responsibility which it has not for several years possessed. Why is 1t that l the Senate of this state has so long been re- l garded as mere cypher in legislation Why is it that nothing has ever been heard of their proceedings, unless it was the rejection of some appointment which the lower house had made of some honest and capable man, and | the substitution ofsome other person less quail flied in his room It is because there has not ] been men in the senate chamber who are qualified for that station, and men whom it is in the power of the republican party to place there.\n\n Again.-The District ticket has the prefer ence in respect to the manner in which the nominations are made out. It is in fact the peoples ticket. It has been agreed upon in the primary assemblies of the electors. The gentlemen upon it are well known to those who have presented their names to the pub lie; whereas the caucus ticket is made out by very small minority of the republican mem bers of the assembly (the greater part having become disgusted with this method of making nOminations,) and is the result of the l,bours of whole session spent in bargaining and ill- triguing for office, instead of being engaged in the business upon which they were sent.\n\n Another reason for which give the per ference to the District Ticket is, that if it is elected, the consequence will he the adoption of a measure which has ever been prime ob- ject with all genuine republicans. refer to the subject of Districting the State for the choice of Senators and members of Congress. The neglect of the federal party, when in power, to do this, was the subject of more animadver- sion for the then minority than any other. It ] is what republicans. q mean such as were not afraid to call themselves by that name when federalism was in it's full strength,) have al- ways been solicitous to procure done and what they expected to see accomplished without delay when their party came into power.-l For some unaccountable reason which have never been able to understand, it was not done when the constitution was adopted. But the people have ever since submitted to the rule of the 4 powers that be-\" under the repeated promise that the object should be accomplish ed in due time; that as soon as party feelings should subsde and a \"calm and settled mod eratiOn\" should rest upon the community the State should be districted for the purposes above mentioned, and thus very fav0urite object of the democratic party should be brought about.-Now l ask you to mark the result of the measures which have been taken ",
