The\nGeneral was thus carried as in a paanquin, to a\ncertain distance from the river side, then he\nwhom have already distinguished as the chief\nOf the tribe approached, and told him in English,\nthat all his brothers were happy at being visited\nby him, who in his affection for the inhabitants\nof America, had never distinguished blood or\ncolor; who was the cherished father OF mcn who\nnhabitthe continent After the chief had spok\nen-, the other Indians came to press the hand OF\nthe General and to place it on their heads.

The\ncry which was raised by each Of the two divisions,\nand which they told us was the war-cry Of the\nIndian tribes, is perhaps, the strongest modnla-\nton of the human voice, that it is possible to\nhear, and the effect which it produced upon the\nwarriors, Young and old, is more extraordinary\nstill.

A\ngreat number ot women and young boys broke\nthrough the trees on the opposite border Of the\naver, and, upon seeing rs, they raised cries Of\n10Y. Some warriors descended the brow of\ni.lll at little distance and to spot on the\nriver side where the boat was, iii which we were\n20 land-Thc variety and singular richness Of\ntheir costumes offered most picturesque view.\nhlr George Lafayette splan!s first upon the land,\nand III moment was surrounded by men, wo\nincn and children, who moved round him, dane\ned about him, touched his hands and his garments\nwith an air Of surprise, and delight which caus\nCd him almost as much embarrassment rs emo.\nton Suddenly, as il they wished to give more\ndgnhed and solemn expression to their Joy they\nretired behind the men ranged in front. lie\nwho appeared to be the chief Of the tribe, By\nshr and prolonged cry gave the signal for a sort\nOF salute which was repeated by the whole troops\nwhen they rushed again towards the boat.-Im-\nmediately upon the Generals descending, some\nof the strongest brought little low chair, which\nwe had with us, and obliged him to mount it,\n\"not wishing they said, shat their father\nshould put his foot on the damp earth.' The\nGeneral was thus carried as in a paanquin, to a\ncertain distance from the river side, then he\nwhom have already distinguished as the chief\nOf the tribe approached, and told him in English,\nthat all his brothers were happy at being visited\nby him, who in his affection for the inhabitants\nof America, had never distinguished blood or\ncolor; who was the cherished father OF mcn who\nnhabitthe continent After the chief had spok\nen-, the other Indians came to press the hand OF\nthe General and to place it on their heads. They\nwould not abandon the carriage, but dragged ii\nthemselves, mounted by short steps the hill from\nwhich which we had seen them descend, and ON\nwhich was situated one OF their largest hamets,\n\n\nWhilst We walked, approached the Indian\nChief thought that, since lie spoke English, he\nhad been brought up like liamly in the United\nStates, and SO was informed lie was about 28\nyears of aye, Of middle size his limbs per\nfectv beautiful, his phys,ognony noble, and hi,\nairsorowfi.l. When he did not speak he cast\ndown his large black eyes, which were covered\nWith thick eyc-lashes. When he toll me that he\nwas the eldest son Of Macintosh, could not re-\ncal, without pain, the mPrecations that | had\nheard from the watch, against the Ctiet OF the\nMaacogulges 1t was this, undoubtedly, which\ngave the young man the air Of detection and\nmeditation; but, after what coali gather, from\nhis conversation, explained il to myself still\nbetter his Intelligence only developed itself a\nthe expense ofhis security. lie appreciated the\ntrue position fthis nation; he perceived it was\ngrowing weaker, and forcsaw its approaching\ndistinctions he feh how inferior it was to those\nwhich surrounded III he had learned how impos\nslble it was to change the wandering lite ot men\nof his race. The neighborhood ofclylzed men\nhad not done them any good, and had introduced\namong them vices to which they we're strangers\n\n\nHe seemed to hope that the treaty, which cast\nthem back into country wholly desert, would\nrestore the ancient organization Of the tribes, or\nat least guaranty their preservation in the state\nn which they now were.\n\n\nIn the meantime. we arrived at the top Of the\nhlll-there we saw helmets, and swords, and\nhorsemen, ranged along the road; they were\nnot Indians, but civilized men sent from the state\nOf Alabama, to meet the General. The slngu-\nlar triumphant march, to which he had been\nobliged to submit, then ceased. The Indians\ncould not see without Jealousy. the American\nescort place themselves around him; but we ap.\npreached their village, and they hastened to\napproach il before rs. There, at our afrval, we\nfound them met together, having thrown aside\ntheir garments and prepared to exhibit before\nrs their warlike games. We reached vast\nplain, about which was scattered q hundred In.\ndian habitations, improved BY the verdure Of the\nthick groves We noticed house larger than\nthe others; it was that Of the American resident;\nhe at the same time kept an inn, and his wife had\nthe direction ofa school, in which they attempt\ned tc instruct the children Of the Indians All\nthe men were assembled in this place, having\nthrown aside part Of their vestnents; their faces\npainted with colors Enthusiastically mixed and some\nwearing, by way Of distinction, plumes in their\nhair, They told us that they were going to play\nin honor Of their white father And we really\nsaw them separate into two armies, form two\ncamps in two extremities Oft the place, name two\nchiefs, and provoke each other to combat. The\ncry which was raised by each Of the two divisions,\nand which they told us was the war-cry Of the\nIndian tribes, is perhaps, the strongest modnla-\nton of the human voice, that it is possible to\nhear, and the effect which it produced upon the\nwarriors, Young and old, is more extraordinary\nstill. The sports commenced-They explained\nto us that the game was, for the two parties to\nthrow ball, something like that of our scholars,\n10 certain mark, and that he who struck this\nmark seven times should be victorious We in\nreality saw the combatants, each armed with\ntwo long and heavy rockets prcc tate them.\nselves with light movement, leap one above\nthe other, in order to seize It in the air, with\n\n\nunprecedented skill, and scnd il to the mark ~\nwhen the ball was missed by player, it rolled\non the pround-Then they all lowered theil",
