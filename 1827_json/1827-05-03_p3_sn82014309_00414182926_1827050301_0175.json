ElectiOn.-A very full meeting of citizens without distinction of ancient parties, was held at Faneuil Hall last evening, for the purpose ofadopting measures for procuring d nomination of suitable candidates for representatives from this town, in the general Court. MT. w. Barry was chosen Moderator, and MT. John Lowell, Jr. Secretary. The meet ing was addressed by MT D. l.. Child, who proposed several resolutions for adop- tion, conforming in their general tenor and spirit with those adopted on former meete ing, and published in our paper on Thurs day. He was followed by MT. Bond, in a speech in favor of the resolutions and of the course proposed to be pursued. After some remarks by Mir. Clough, in which he urged the expediency of giving the most decisive support to the national and state Administrations, MT. Webster addressed the meeting in a speech of considerable length, in which he presented his views of the course which should be pursued by the electors of this city, in the present state of public affairs. The resolutions were unanimously adopted, and committee of S6 members, 2 from each ward, and 12 at large. was appointed, to form list of candidates as soon as the number shall be fixed by the City Council, and to report the same for consideration of future meeting.\n\n ACTIVE BENEvoLENcE \"A horse, harness sed to chaise, twas observed during greater part of yesterday, tied at the lower end of Merchants Hall.

In Portland, Me. during the gale on the 18th inst. adOut 60 feet of the new part of the wharf was carried away. At Meeklen- burg Va. on the evening of the 10th, a storm was experienced, in which the hail stones were from the size of bullet to that of d hens egg. Much window-glass was broken. and the buds, &c. on the trees were beaten off. In the borough of Butler Pa. on Tuesday of last week, tree was blown acoss wag- on and caused the death of Mr. Newman, his wife and one child. 4 barn was blown down, and house unroofed. The same day about II o'clock, storm with rain passed through Beaver county, during which MT.

The papers inform us that the whole range of the CattskiIl mountains arc covered with snow to con- siderable depth. Cloaks are not usually needed on the first day of May ;-but this year few persons appeared to feel com fortable without one. We have reason to fear that this change in the weather from what it was three weeks since, will destroy peaches if not sundry other kinds of fruit.\n\n Fir.-The inhabitants of this quiet village were on Tuesday evening last aroused from their cosltations by the alarming cry of fire. This was an almost entirely new sound to a great majority of the citizens; for however it may be with other villages of similar size, which have engines to extinguish fire, and of course can afford to have them often, we, be- ing destitute of like safe guards, and depend ing solely upon Etna and Protection insur- ance policies, have heretofore. at least for several years, seen no larger flame than is made by a shaving bonfire But we have di- gressed; as above stated, there was on Tues day evening fire no less real than the burn ing of house. How it took fire is the ques- ton; Tuesday was d cold day, and had the tenement been inhabited by bipeds we might kaye concluded that the room had been over- heated to keep them warm; but such an expla- nation will not answer, for we are told that there has becn no fire near the building for several weeks except that which \"levelled it with the dust\" We must therefore conclude. that the said house possessed certain inherent ignitible qualities, winch kindly refrained from acting while it stood in the immediate vicinity of better buildings; but on its being removed to a new location, where it could burn without alarming its neighbours, it peace ably took itself out of the way. Damage,- to the owner SloO,OO.\n\n So great IS the dearth of news at the pres ent time, that after looking over fifty or sixty papers from different parts of the country, we can scarcely find sufficient suitable matter to fill our sheet. We seized our last New York and Boston papers. with eagerness, ho- ping to find two or three columns filled with \"latest and important intelligence from Flu rope;\" but here we were disappointed. No thing of importance is copyed from English and French papers. except the \" Fashions for May,\" and sundry theatrical notices. How ever important such articles may he to the ci- ty gentry, we care not enough about them to induce us to read more than the caption, and take it for granted that our readers are some what likeminded.

Mallory who was at the helm, and the disaster occurred in the man. ner that has been mentioned. Capt. Bun- ker immediately sent his boat, and several men, intending to tow the schooner to land but she filled so fast they had only time to save few articles before she went down. He then left the boat with Capt Mallory to enable him to pick up whatever might float from the wreck. Not the slightest blame for the disaster could be attached to Capt. Bunker, who did every thing he could to avoid it.--D0iLy Ado.\n\n BosToN, April 2l.\n\n Representative. ElectiOn.-A very full meeting of citizens without distinction of ancient parties, was held at Faneuil Hall last evening, for the purpose ofadopting measures for procuring d nomination of suitable candidates for representatives from this town, in the general Court. MT. w. Barry was chosen Moderator, and MT. John Lowell, Jr. Secretary. The meet ing was addressed by MT D. l.. Child, who proposed several resolutions for adop- tion, conforming in their general tenor and spirit with those adopted on former meete ing, and published in our paper on Thurs day. He was followed by MT. Bond, in a speech in favor of the resolutions and of the course proposed to be pursued. After some remarks by Mir. Clough, in which he urged the expediency of giving the most decisive support to the national and state Administrations, MT. Webster addressed the meeting in a speech of considerable length, in which he presented his views of the course which should be pursued by the electors of this city, in the present state of public affairs. The resolutions were unanimously adopted, and committee of S6 members, 2 from each ward, and 12 at large. was appointed, to form list of candidates as soon as the number shall be fixed by the City Council, and to report the same for consideration of future meeting.\n\n ACTIVE BENEvoLENcE \"A horse, harness sed to chaise, twas observed during greater part of yesterday, tied at the lower end of Merchants Hall. Some passer-by, more con- siderate than the owner of the beast, towards night placed on conspicuous part of the har- ness the following label: \"Wanted! Hotfa Peek of Oats. Inquire hin.\"-Boston Co,r- Ter.\n\n Another Warning to Sabbath Breakers.-On Sunday morning three young men took a small boat from the soop Patriot, at Spring street wharf, with the intention of proceeding on sailing excursion, but when they had reached about midway of the river, a sudden flaw capsized the boat,a Alexander Mackay, ,hn | O others were enabled to reach the shore. Mac kay has left widowed mother, ,who is incon- solable at the loss of her only son-a son too, who had been tenderly brought up, and who was urged, by all the tender ties of an affec- tiOnate mothei, to desist from his boat excur- sion on the Sabbsth. We understand that the last words of the mother to him were \"AIexander, if you go this day shall never see you again. n.'-Com. Ado.\n\n Seuere Storms--The papers from various directions bring accounts of damage done by the late storms, and in some instances the loss olives. In Portland, Me. during the gale on the 18th inst. adOut 60 feet of the new part of the wharf was carried away. At Meeklen- burg Va. on the evening of the 10th, a storm was experienced, in which the hail stones were from the size of bullet to that of d hens egg. Much window-glass was broken. and the buds, &c. on the trees were beaten off. In the borough of Butler Pa. on Tuesday of last week, tree was blown acoss wag- on and caused the death of Mr. Newman, his wife and one child. 4 barn was blown down, and house unroofed. The same day about II o'clock, storm with rain passed through Beaver county, during which MT. Andrew Sands, two miles below BeavertOwn, wa. crushed to death by the fall ofa tree and MT John Alcorn. of Moon township, received severe wounds on his head and shoulders by the fall of limb.\n\n The Philadelphia papers mention that at the late session of the yearly meeting of Friends in that city, three thousand dollars were ap- propriated towards defraying the expenses of certain free people of colour from North Car olina. to Liberia, Hayti, and the free states,as they may prefer\n\n The American Trade with China last year amounted to $B,949, ,542, The commerce be- tween China and South America was double what it had been the year previous.\n\n At the Merrimack company's mils,in Low cit, Mass. eleven thousond yards of cloth $ Manut tactured daity most of which is printed for calicoes.\n\n The Editors of the Bostnn Recorder and Telegraph have issued proposals for publish Ing weekly paper for the special use oi \" AI~1 Al",

Contrary to his fears, the lat- ter came up four days earlier than the for mer it was not injured in the least by worms or birds, while one half of the hills on the other two acres required to be plan ted second time. If the seed being im- Pregnated with the salts is not injured, if it will grow as well as seed not soaked-- the experiment can easily be made wheth- CT the salts will preserve # from birds and worms, by exposing quant;+y of it where worms, squirrels and birds can have access it. 1t is worthy an experiment of the kind, and we trust some of our agricultu- ralists will give it trial, for their own, as we'll as the public good.\n\n The severe cold with which we were visited on the first inst. is accounted for, from the fact, that the late storm was one of snow at the north. The papers inform us that the whole range of the CattskiIl mountains arc covered with snow to con- siderable depth. Cloaks are not usually needed on the first day of May ;-but this year few persons appeared to feel com fortable without one. We have reason to fear that this change in the weather from what it was three weeks since, will destroy peaches if not sundry other kinds of fruit.\n\n Fir.-The inhabitants of this quiet village were on Tuesday evening last aroused from their cosltations by the alarming cry of fire. This was an almost entirely new sound to a great majority of the citizens; for however it may be with other villages of similar size, which have engines to extinguish fire, and of course can afford to have them often, we, be- ing destitute of like safe guards, and depend ing solely upon Etna and Protection insur- ance policies, have heretofore. at least for several years, seen no larger flame than is made by a shaving bonfire But we have di- gressed; as above stated, there was on Tues day evening fire no less real than the burn ing of house. How it took fire is the ques- ton; Tuesday was d cold day, and had the tenement been inhabited by bipeds we might kaye concluded that the room had been over- heated to keep them warm; but such an expla- nation will not answer, for we are told that there has becn no fire near the building for several weeks except that which \"levelled it with the dust\" We must therefore conclude. that the said house possessed certain inherent ignitible qualities, winch kindly refrained from acting while it stood in the immediate vicinity of better buildings; but on its being removed to a new location, where it could burn without alarming its neighbours, it peace ably took itself out of the way. Damage,- to the owner SloO,OO.\n\n So great IS the dearth of news at the pres ent time, that after looking over fifty or sixty papers from different parts of the country, we can scarcely find sufficient suitable matter to fill our sheet. We seized our last New York and Boston papers. with eagerness, ho- ping to find two or three columns filled with \"latest and important intelligence from Flu rope;\" but here we were disappointed. No thing of importance is copyed from English and French papers. except the \" Fashions for May,\" and sundry theatrical notices. How ever important such articles may he to the ci- ty gentry, we care not enough about them to induce us to read more than the caption, and take it for granted that our readers are some what likeminded. Fer want of more imme- diately interesting matter, the presidential question fills pretty large share of every i'm portant political paper; certain of these arti- cles we feel strongly inclined to copy, in or der to be in keeping with our contemporaries. The Morgan affair is by no means forgotten nor should it be until some of the darkness which surrounds it is expelled; but we live out of its influence, aud have ourselves said enough on the subject, until we can say MOrpa n iS alive n or tho r,onrdarors oc tt a",
