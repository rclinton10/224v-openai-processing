Knowing that of course they would subside when the struggle was over, the anticipation ofwhich had called thesn before the public. ..\n\n But there is one subject which in my opin- :on is worthy of consideration, which has been almost wholly neglected; and have wait cd for yeaTs.hoping that some abler pen would present it to the public, and particularly to the inhabitants of Litchkeld County-l mean Church Music. might probably not coniine my remarks to this County when say. that very many of the supporters of our ecclesiasti- cal societies, manifest towards this subject a most astonishing, most criminal indifference. This think arises from the fact that music is 70 very little understood by the community at large: they do not consider. or they do not know, that it is science which most per. sons can cultivate equally with Arithmetic, English Grammar, or even the art of Read ing.

While practising in school, a few pieces of church music are sung over, and over, and over till no one can be supposed to forgot them, and then they are said to be learned and the school closes for the season. Alter this, when the patrons of the school assemble on the sab bath for worship, and hoping for assistance in their devotions from the choir. in return for their libcra!ity in supporting it. how grievously are they disappointed. The younger singers occasionally ,and perhaps some of their fathers occasionally too, take their seats in the choir for an afternoon, and the singing is conducted merely as interludes between the scenes to enable the audience to relax their attention, and to give the preacher time to take breath 1; for both the preacher and: the audience too frequently seem to regard the singing as a part in which they have no concern; and also they seem not to be aware that while preach- ing is DO where ia Scripture spoken of as al part of morshsp. singing is mentioned perhaps even more frequently than prayer.-But the singers having been accustomed to drilling over their tunes in school until they have lost their intrrest, seon become disgusted and abandon their seats, resolved t\" lMy no attention to an art 50 uninteresting and contemptible.- And no wonder they think so for from the example oftheir fathers. they have DO. reason so tiiink it duty; and from their own expe- rience they do not expect any pleasure from the performance. But the evil does not stop here; the congregation finding that the sing school closes, begin to recollect that 1t always wasso; and hence they conclude 1t always will be so: and further, that it will do no good to take any measures to remedy an evil which by this time they conceive is sirremediable.- But notwithstanding, there arc doubtless rem edies, and those remedies too within onr reach. for there are instances where the subject has been treated in some measure with the isDpor- tance 1t deserves, and the experiment bas sat isfied most of those concerned. that the ad- tages resulting from well regulated Singing Schools. are such as shsuld recommend them selves to the liberal patronage of every well wishcr to community, and every friend of Religion and Morality.

This think arises from the fact that music is 70 very little understood by the community at large: they do not consider. or they do not know, that it is science which most per. sons can cultivate equally with Arithmetic, English Grammar, or even the art of Read ing.

While practising in school, a few pieces of church music are sung over, and over, and over till no one can be supposed to forgot them, and then they are said to be learned and the school closes for the season. Alter this, when the patrons of the school assemble on the sab bath for worship, and hoping for assistance in their devotions from the choir. in return for their libcra!ity in supporting it. how grievously are they disappointed. The younger singers occasionally ,and perhaps some of their fathers occasionally too, take their seats in the choir for an afternoon, and the singing is conducted merely as interludes between the scenes to enable the audience to relax their attention, and to give the preacher time to take breath 1; for both the preacher and: the audience too frequently seem to regard the singing as a part in which they have no concern; and also they seem not to be aware that while preach- ing is DO where ia Scripture spoken of as al part of morshsp. singing is mentioned perhaps even more frequently than prayer.-But the singers having been accustomed to drilling over their tunes in school until they have lost their intrrest, seon become disgusted and abandon their seats, resolved t\" lMy no attention to an art 50 uninteresting and contemptible.- And no wonder they think so for from the example oftheir fathers. they have DO. reason so tiiink it duty; and from their own expe- rience they do not expect any pleasure from the performance. But the evil does not stop here; the congregation finding that the sing school closes, begin to recollect that 1t always wasso; and hence they conclude 1t always will be so: and further, that it will do no good to take any measures to remedy an evil which by this time they conceive is sirremediable.- But notwithstanding, there arc doubtless rem edies, and those remedies too within onr reach. for there are instances where the subject has been treated in some measure with the isDpor- tance 1t deserves, and the experiment bas sat isfied most of those concerned. that the ad- tages resulting from well regulated Singing Schools. are such as shsuld recommend them selves to the liberal patronage of every well wishcr to community, and every friend of Religion and Morality.
