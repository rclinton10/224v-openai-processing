It may he hoped, and for the honor of human nature we are in clined to believe, there was touch of insani- ty in this unnatural strain of ferocity; and the wild and squallid features of the wretch appear to have intimated degree of alena- ton of mind. Marat was, like Robespierre, a coward. Repeatedly denounced in the As sembly, he skulked instead of defending him self, and lay concealed in some obscure gar ret or cellar among his cut-throats, until a storm appeared, when, like bird Ofill omen, his death screech was again heard. Such was the strange and fatal trumvirate,in in which the same degree of cannibal cruelty existed under different aspects. Danton murdered to glut his rage; Robespierre to avenge his inju red vanity, or to remove rival whom he en- vied; Marat from the same instinctive love of blood, which induces wolf to continue his ravage of the fiocks long after his hunger is for his cowardice, Robespierre feared the fe rocious audacity of Danton; and with him to fear was to hate-and to hate was-when the hour arrived-to destroy. They differed in their ideas also of the mode of exercising their terrible system ofgovernment. Danton had cften in his mouth the sentence of Mach iayel, that when it became necessary to shed blood single great massacre has more dreadful effect than series of successive executions. RObespierre, on the contrary, preferred the latter process as the best way of sustaining the reign of terror. The appetite of Marat could not be satiated but by comh ming both modes of murder. Both Danton and Robespierre kept aloof from the sanguin ary Marat.\n\n Among the three monsters mentioned, Danton had the energy which the Girondists wanted, and was well acquainted with the secret movements of those institutions to which they possessed no key. His vices of wrath, luxury, love of spoil, dreadful as they were, are the attributes of mortal men; the envy of Robespicrre, and the instructive blood thirstiness of Marat were the properties of fends. Danton, like the huge serpent called the Boa, might be approached with degree of safety when gorged with prey-but the ap- petite of Marat for blood was like the horse leech, which says,-Not enough-and the slaughterous envy of Robespierre was like the gnawing worm that dieth not, and yields no interval of repose. In glutting Danton with spoil, and furnishing the means of indulging his luxury, the Glrondists might have pur- chased his support but nothing under the supreme rule in France would have satisfied RObespierre and an unlimited torrent of the blood of that unhappy country could alone have satiated Marat. If colleague was to be chosen out of that detestable triumvirate, unquestionaby Danton was to be considered as the most eligible\"",

The singular occurrence which produced the death of this young\n\n Clergyman, Nehemiah was fond of relating :; and soon after he gave me an account of his own love adventures, he gratifed me with the following narratve:-\n\n \"After had been Clerk of this Church about ten years,' said Nehemiah, |\" the then Rector became too old and feeble to fulfil his Clerical duties, and a Curate was engaged to assist him: that Curate was the Rev. Alfred COrsar, and more worthy or pious Minister never preached in - Church. At his first l introduction he won the hearts of all by the kindness and cheerfulness of his manners, and by the fervency and devotion with which he performed the duties of his office; but his career was short and heeting, and before he had been long with us, an event occurred which blasted his future hopes, and laid him in an untimely grave.\n\n Amongst the female part ofthe congrega- ton, was a young lady named Louisa MOr- daunt, the daughter of gentlcmau in easy circumstances, who was at that time filling the office of Church-warden. It was not long before Alfred Corsar was introduced to her, ] and his visits to her fathers house became very frequent; strong affection arose in his breast, and Louisa MOrdaunt was it's object, but he never had the courage to avOw his love, nor in truth, did the conduct of Miss Mordaunt give him the least encourage ment, so that he continued to cherish pas sion as hopeless as it was fervent, without daring to proclaim it to the world. l had some suspicion of his feelings from his fre- quent inquiries respecting Miss Mordaunt, and was soon dreadfully convinced of the truth of my surmises, and the extent of his love.\n\n was sitting one evening enjoying my usual beverage at the Griffin, when I recei we'd a message to attend at the Church. l went, and found stranger waiting, who in- formed me that he intended to be married on the following morning, having obtained license from the Rector for that purpose of course I acquiesced, and inquired the name of the lady :-it was Louisa Mordaunt! was much surprised at this, as had never before heard of Miss Mordaunt having a lover, but afterwards learnt that the gentleman wko now addressed me, had long been her admi- Ter, though living at a distance; their courtship had been carried on by letters, until her lover found himself lI a situa- tOn to claim her as his bridc when she readily consented to bastow her hand where she had already bestowed her heart, only stipulating that the marriage ceremony should be performed in - Church. Having assur ed the stranger that every thing should be prepared for the ceremony, he left the Church, and proceeded to. inform MT. Cor sar that his services would be required on the following morning. On being introduced told him my errand. \"Well. Nehemiah\" said he, \"a and who is the lady ?\" mentioned Louisa MOrdaunt. Never shall forget his look at that moment: it was one of fixed de- spair, and he seemed as if his faculties were suspended and his frame withered by some sudden visitation of Heaven. At length, by an effort almost superhuman, he recovered, and waving his hand, said, \" Go, go :; I will at tend\" I left him, deeply commiserating his Louisa Mordaunt.\n\n On the following morning proceeded to the Church at the hour appointed, and on entering the Vestry found Mir. Corsar there, but the wedding party had not arrived. MT. COrsar was standing near the window, absorb ed in reverie, he looked dreadfuly pale, and his eyes had wildness quite unusual. When he was aware of my presence, he requested me to hand him glass of wine, which he drank with frightful eagerness; ; he requested another, which he drank with the same av- dty, and then sunk on seat quite exhaust ed. To my inquiries he returned no answer, but pressed his hand violently to his forehead At length the wedding party arrived at the Church, and after the necessary prelimina- ries, ranged themselves in order for the cerc- mony; the Curate left the Vestry without speaking, and with slow aud faultering step entered the Altar he then commenced the service-the exordium he gave with sub lime effect, as fine expected his words would coniure up some impeachment to the marriage, and when he arri, cd at that part which says, off any man can show just cause of impedi- ment why these persons may not be lawfully joined together in holy wedIock, let him now speak\" he paused, and gazrd around with look of eager expectation but no answer being returned, he was compelled to pro- cecd yet he seemed to cling to the remain der of the passage with hopeless tenacity, giving the conclusion with sublime and al- most terrific energy. The party assembled were astonished, and gazed on each other with speeches. amazement, not knowing what to make of such strange conduct of the minister. At length he asked the bridegroom the question, Wilt thou have this woman to be thy welded wife 2\" &c.to which, of course, the answer was, will\"\n\n | A pause then ensued, during which NIT. l Corsar seemed to be summoning all his ener-\n\n gies for the next interrogation he retreated\n\n some steps backwards, and then. hastily ad-\n\n vancing, put the question to Louisa Mor-",

H.\n\n DAYTON, ROBESPIERRE AND MA RAT.\n\n The American Quarterly Review, new and able periodical, published at Philadelphia, l under the direction of Robert Walsh, jun. Esq. contains among other subjects ofa highly in l teresting character, Review of the Life of Napoleon\" by the author of Waverly. We are indebted to it for the following extract, descriptive ofthe ferOcious and bloody trium- virs, Danton, Robespiarre and Marat, those sangunary ruffians, who rode upon the whIr- wind and directed the storm of the French Revolution. The cool and calculating cruelty of these three monsters cannot find its parallel in the darkest ages of barbarity.\n\n Three men ofterror, whose names will long remain, we trust unattached in history by those of any similar miscreants, had now the unrivaled leading of the Jacobins, and were called the triumvirate.\n\n Danton deserves to be named first, as unr- vailed by his colleagues in talents and audaci ty. He was a man of gigantic size, and pos sessed a voice of thunder. His countenance was that of an ogre on the shoulders of a Her Op,1ac cDv,A nF v>l, l wee as of the practice of cruelty; and it was said there were times when he became hu- manized amidst his debauchery, laughed at the terror which his furious declamations ex- cited. and might be approached with safety, like the Maelstrom at the turn of tide. His prOfusien was indulged to an extent hazardous to his popularity, for the populace are jealous of a lavish expenditure, as raising their favor ties too much. above their own degree: and the charge of peculation finds always ready credit with them, when brought against public men.\n\n Robespicrre possessed this advantage over Danton, that he did not seem to seek for wealth either for hoarding or for expending, but lived in strict and economical retirement, to justify the name of the Incorruptible, with which he was honoured by his partizans. He appears to have possessed little talent, save a deep fund of hypocrisy, considerable powers of sOphistry, and a cold exaggerated strain of oratory, as foreign to good taste, as the mea sures he recommended were to ordinary ha- manity. It seemed wonderful, that even the seething and boiling of the revolutionary caul- drOn should have sent up from the bottom, and long supported on the surface, thing so miserably void of claims to public distinction; but Robespierre had to impose on the minds k@ kNvu, A..r slo them, by accommodating his flattery to their passions and scale of understanding, and by acts of cunning and hypocrisy, which weigh more with the multitude than the words of eloquence, or the arguments of wisdom. The people listened as to their Cicero, when he twanged out his apostrophes of P0urre Peu- ple, Peuple vertuemr and hastened to execute whatever came recommended by such homed phrases, though devised by the worst of men for the worst and most iDhuman of purposes.\n\n Vanity was Robespierre's ruling passion, and though his countenance was the image of his mind, he was vain even of his personal ap- pearance, and never adopted the external hab- it's of a sans cuOtte. Amongst his fellow ia- cobins he was distinguished by the nicety with which his hair was arranged and pow dered and the neatness of his dress was care fully attended to, so as to COunterDaldnCe, II possible, the vuIgarity of his person. His a. partments, though small, were elegant. and vanity had filled them with representations of the occupant.-Robespierre picture, at length, hung in one pace, his miniature in another, his bust occupied niche, and on the table were disposed few medalIions exhibiting his head in profile. The vanity which all this in- dicated was one of the coldest and most selfish character, being such as considers neglect an insult, and receives homage merely as trib- ute; so that, while praise is received without gratitude, it is withheld at the risk of mortal late. Self-Io,e of this dangerous character\n\n is closely allied with envy. and Robespierre was one of the most cnvious men that ever lived. He was never known to pardon any opposition, affront or even rivalry: and to be marked in his tablets on such an account, was a sure, though not an immediate sentence of death. Danton was hero, compared with this cold calculating, creeping miscreant; for his passions, though exaggerated, had at least some touch of humanity, and his brutal ferO- city was supported by brutal courage. Ro- bespierre was coward, who signed death- warrants with hand that shook, though his hand was relentless. He possessed no pas sions on which to charge his crimes; they were perpetrated in cold blood, and upon ma ture deliberatiOn.\n\n Marat, the third this internal triumvirate., Al",

It may he hoped, and for the honor of human nature we are in clined to believe, there was touch of insani- ty in this unnatural strain of ferocity; and the wild and squallid features of the wretch appear to have intimated degree of alena- ton of mind. Marat was, like Robespierre, a coward. Repeatedly denounced in the As sembly, he skulked instead of defending him self, and lay concealed in some obscure gar ret or cellar among his cut-throats, until a storm appeared, when, like bird Ofill omen, his death screech was again heard. Such was the strange and fatal trumvirate,in in which the same degree of cannibal cruelty existed under different aspects. Danton murdered to glut his rage; Robespierre to avenge his inju red vanity, or to remove rival whom he en- vied; Marat from the same instinctive love of blood, which induces wolf to continue his ravage of the fiocks long after his hunger is for his cowardice, Robespierre feared the fe rocious audacity of Danton; and with him to fear was to hate-and to hate was-when the hour arrived-to destroy. They differed in their ideas also of the mode of exercising their terrible system ofgovernment. Danton had cften in his mouth the sentence of Mach iayel, that when it became necessary to shed blood single great massacre has more dreadful effect than series of successive executions. RObespierre, on the contrary, preferred the latter process as the best way of sustaining the reign of terror. The appetite of Marat could not be satiated but by comh ming both modes of murder. Both Danton and Robespierre kept aloof from the sanguin ary Marat.\n\n Among the three monsters mentioned, Danton had the energy which the Girondists wanted, and was well acquainted with the secret movements of those institutions to which they possessed no key. His vices of wrath, luxury, love of spoil, dreadful as they were, are the attributes of mortal men; the envy of Robespicrre, and the instructive blood thirstiness of Marat were the properties of fends. Danton, like the huge serpent called the Boa, might be approached with degree of safety when gorged with prey-but the ap- petite of Marat for blood was like the horse leech, which says,-Not enough-and the slaughterous envy of Robespierre was like the gnawing worm that dieth not, and yields no interval of repose. In glutting Danton with spoil, and furnishing the means of indulging his luxury, the Glrondists might have pur- chased his support but nothing under the supreme rule in France would have satisfied RObespierre and an unlimited torrent of the blood of that unhappy country could alone have satiated Marat. If colleague was to be chosen out of that detestable triumvirate, unquestionaby Danton was to be considered as the most eligible\"",

From this I@continued on, meeting little else than cotton fields, cotton gins, and cot- ton wagons. At Jacksonsborough there is much cotton raised. After meeting number of wagons loaded with cotton, I arrived at Barnwell; where the cotton fields and cotton gins extended even unto the village and where all the talk of him that laboreth, and he that is learned in the law, and him that sits on the judges seat, is of cotton. nAfter leaving Barnwell, O. vertook vast number of cotton loaded wagons, bound to Augusta and at the ferry, three miles below the town, had to wait for ten of thcm to cross before could go over. l now came to Augusta; and when I saw the cotton wagons in Brodd- street, ' vhistled! but said nothing !- But this was not all /; there was more than dozen tow boats in the river, with more than a thousand bales of cotton on each and several steam-boats with still more.

The singular occurrence which produced the death of this young\n\n Clergyman, Nehemiah was fond of relating :; and soon after he gave me an account of his own love adventures, he gratifed me with the following narratve:-\n\n \"After had been Clerk of this Church about ten years,' said Nehemiah, |\" the then Rector became too old and feeble to fulfil his Clerical duties, and a Curate was engaged to assist him: that Curate was the Rev. Alfred COrsar, and more worthy or pious Minister never preached in - Church. At his first l introduction he won the hearts of all by the kindness and cheerfulness of his manners, and by the fervency and devotion with which he performed the duties of his office; but his career was short and heeting, and before he had been long with us, an event occurred which blasted his future hopes, and laid him in an untimely grave.\n\n Amongst the female part ofthe congrega- ton, was a young lady named Louisa MOr- daunt, the daughter of gentlcmau in easy circumstances, who was at that time filling the office of Church-warden. It was not long before Alfred Corsar was introduced to her, ] and his visits to her fathers house became very frequent; strong affection arose in his breast, and Louisa MOrdaunt was it's object, but he never had the courage to avOw his love, nor in truth, did the conduct of Miss Mordaunt give him the least encourage ment, so that he continued to cherish pas sion as hopeless as it was fervent, without daring to proclaim it to the world. l had some suspicion of his feelings from his fre- quent inquiries respecting Miss Mordaunt, and was soon dreadfully convinced of the truth of my surmises, and the extent of his love.\n\n was sitting one evening enjoying my usual beverage at the Griffin, when I recei we'd a message to attend at the Church. l went, and found stranger waiting, who in- formed me that he intended to be married on the following morning, having obtained license from the Rector for that purpose of course I acquiesced, and inquired the name of the lady :-it was Louisa Mordaunt! was much surprised at this, as had never before heard of Miss Mordaunt having a lover, but afterwards learnt that the gentleman wko now addressed me, had long been her admi- Ter, though living at a distance; their courtship had been carried on by letters, until her lover found himself lI a situa- tOn to claim her as his bridc when she readily consented to bastow her hand where she had already bestowed her heart, only stipulating that the marriage ceremony should be performed in - Church. Having assur ed the stranger that every thing should be prepared for the ceremony, he left the Church, and proceeded to. inform MT. Cor sar that his services would be required on the following morning. On being introduced told him my errand. \"Well. Nehemiah\" said he, \"a and who is the lady ?\" mentioned Louisa MOrdaunt. Never shall forget his look at that moment: it was one of fixed de- spair, and he seemed as if his faculties were suspended and his frame withered by some sudden visitation of Heaven. At length, by an effort almost superhuman, he recovered, and waving his hand, said, \" Go, go :; I will at tend\" I left him, deeply commiserating his Louisa Mordaunt.\n\n On the following morning proceeded to the Church at the hour appointed, and on entering the Vestry found Mir. Corsar there, but the wedding party had not arrived. MT. COrsar was standing near the window, absorb ed in reverie, he looked dreadfuly pale, and his eyes had wildness quite unusual. When he was aware of my presence, he requested me to hand him glass of wine, which he drank with frightful eagerness; ; he requested another, which he drank with the same av- dty, and then sunk on seat quite exhaust ed. To my inquiries he returned no answer, but pressed his hand violently to his forehead At length the wedding party arrived at the Church, and after the necessary prelimina- ries, ranged themselves in order for the cerc- mony; the Curate left the Vestry without speaking, and with slow aud faultering step entered the Altar he then commenced the service-the exordium he gave with sub lime effect, as fine expected his words would coniure up some impeachment to the marriage, and when he arri, cd at that part which says, off any man can show just cause of impedi- ment why these persons may not be lawfully joined together in holy wedIock, let him now speak\" he paused, and gazrd around with look of eager expectation but no answer being returned, he was compelled to pro- cecd yet he seemed to cling to the remain der of the passage with hopeless tenacity, giving the conclusion with sublime and al- most terrific energy. The party assembled were astonished, and gazed on each other with speeches. amazement, not knowing what to make of such strange conduct of the minister.

They say that they cannot get boats enough in the river to bring the cotton down that is made there; that they make the best cot- ton they ever saw that they have the best cotton lands of all the cotton countries. At Natch hez, there were number of flat, keel, and steam boats, loaded with cot- ton and one of the latter with the four, s boats she had Fin tow, had 21OO bales.

H.\n\n DAYTON, ROBESPIERRE AND MA RAT.\n\n The American Quarterly Review, new and able periodical, published at Philadelphia, l under the direction of Robert Walsh, jun. Esq. contains among other subjects ofa highly in l teresting character, Review of the Life of Napoleon\" by the author of Waverly. We are indebted to it for the following extract, descriptive ofthe ferOcious and bloody trium- virs, Danton, Robespiarre and Marat, those sangunary ruffians, who rode upon the whIr- wind and directed the storm of the French Revolution. The cool and calculating cruelty of these three monsters cannot find its parallel in the darkest ages of barbarity.\n\n Three men ofterror, whose names will long remain, we trust unattached in history by those of any similar miscreants, had now the unrivaled leading of the Jacobins, and were called the triumvirate.\n\n Danton deserves to be named first, as unr- vailed by his colleagues in talents and audaci ty. He was a man of gigantic size, and pos sessed a voice of thunder. His countenance was that of an ogre on the shoulders of a Her Op,1ac cDv,A nF v>l, l wee as of the practice of cruelty; and it was said there were times when he became hu- manized amidst his debauchery, laughed at the terror which his furious declamations ex- cited. and might be approached with safety, like the Maelstrom at the turn of tide. His prOfusien was indulged to an extent hazardous to his popularity, for the populace are jealous of a lavish expenditure, as raising their favor ties too much. above their own degree: and the charge of peculation finds always ready credit with them, when brought against public men.\n\n Robespicrre possessed this advantage over Danton, that he did not seem to seek for wealth either for hoarding or for expending, but lived in strict and economical retirement, to justify the name of the Incorruptible, with which he was honoured by his partizans. He appears to have possessed little talent, save a deep fund of hypocrisy, considerable powers of sOphistry, and a cold exaggerated strain of oratory, as foreign to good taste, as the mea sures he recommended were to ordinary ha- manity. It seemed wonderful, that even the seething and boiling of the revolutionary caul- drOn should have sent up from the bottom, and long supported on the surface, thing so miserably void of claims to public distinction; but Robespierre had to impose on the minds k@ kNvu, A..r slo them, by accommodating his flattery to their passions and scale of understanding, and by acts of cunning and hypocrisy, which weigh more with the multitude than the words of eloquence, or the arguments of wisdom. The people listened as to their Cicero, when he twanged out his apostrophes of P0urre Peu- ple, Peuple vertuemr and hastened to execute whatever came recommended by such homed phrases, though devised by the worst of men for the worst and most iDhuman of purposes.\n\n Vanity was Robespierre's ruling passion, and though his countenance was the image of his mind, he was vain even of his personal ap- pearance, and never adopted the external hab- it's of a sans cuOtte. Amongst his fellow ia- cobins he was distinguished by the nicety with which his hair was arranged and pow dered and the neatness of his dress was care fully attended to, so as to COunterDaldnCe, II possible, the vuIgarity of his person. His a. partments, though small, were elegant. and vanity had filled them with representations of the occupant.-Robespierre picture, at length, hung in one pace, his miniature in another, his bust occupied niche, and on the table were disposed few medalIions exhibiting his head in profile. The vanity which all this in- dicated was one of the coldest and most selfish character, being such as considers neglect an insult, and receives homage merely as trib- ute; so that, while praise is received without gratitude, it is withheld at the risk of mortal late. Self-Io,e of this dangerous character\n\n is closely allied with envy. and Robespierre was one of the most cnvious men that ever lived. He was never known to pardon any opposition, affront or even rivalry: and to be marked in his tablets on such an account, was a sure, though not an immediate sentence of death. Danton was hero, compared with this cold calculating, creeping miscreant; for his passions, though exaggerated, had at least some touch of humanity, and his brutal ferO- city was supported by brutal courage. Ro- bespierre was coward, who signed death- warrants with hand that shook, though his hand was relentless. He possessed no pas sions on which to charge his crimes; they were perpetrated in cold blood, and upon ma ture deliberatiOn.\n\n Marat, the third this internal triumvirate., Al",
