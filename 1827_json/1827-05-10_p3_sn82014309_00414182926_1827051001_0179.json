' The London Courier of the 17th of March says\n\n The Algemeine Zetung, which we have received this morning to the 1lth inst. con- tains an article dated Trieste, March 2d, which states, on the authority of letter from Corfu, of the 18th ult. that the Greeks had possessed themselves of Mis- silonghi.\n\n Irish Catholics.-\" Upon two things, we recollect, that all Catholics in this part of Ireland are nearly unaminous-the ex- pediency of making direct appeal to the Royal lllustrious Parsonage who pronoun- ced the \"parting injunction\" so feelingly alluded to by Sir Francis Burdett, and of forwading another series of petitions, con- tradictory of the hell-born faishoods, if of nothing else, upon which we are to supp pose that the decision of Tuesday night was partly founded. As to the provinces, they will not, we presume, be slow in indi- eating their opinion as to what is proper to be done in the present unhappy state of our affairs. .\"- Dublin paper.\n\n OLD POT TTICAT pARTIES",

            "raw_text": "draw the old party lines in reference to the present Administration and the presses in that interest affect an amusing exclusive ness to the claim of being the organs of the old republican party. To show the talsity of this assertion, tho fact has been stated that but one man of the old Feder- al party, Mir. Mills, of Massachusetts, is attached to the Administration in the Sem ate, while it is notorious, that Messrs. Tazewell, Berrien, Rowan, Ridgely, Me Lane, and we believe some others, are the principal leaders of the Opposition in the Senate, every one of whom were identi- fled with the federal party during the ad ministration of Jefferson and Madison. The Leading paper of the Opposition, the Washington Telegraph, is rather puzzled at this state of the case, and to help the matter has got up list of the members of the Senate, friendly to the Administration, who, according to its story, are of the true Hortford Contention stamp! Our readers will be much amused to learn that this for midahle list is thus made out. After nam- ing Mir. Mills, the Telegraph says-\"We now add to that list\" Ia list, by the way having but one name upon it) \"Mr. Har- rison, of Ohio, MT. Noble, of Indiana, MT. ROBBINS, of Rhode Island, and Clay ton, of Delaware. All of thase are the 1 advocates of MT. Adams, and although they were not all as much identified with the Hartford Convention as Mir. Mills, the editors of the Intelligencer know that they are federalists.\"\n\n As to Mir. Harrison, ever body knows he was appointed governor of the North Western Territory by MT. Jefferson, and Noble has represented Indiana Ia repub- lican state) in the Senate ever since she was admitted iuto the Union. MT. Clay ton undoubtedly ranked as federalist, but he is no longer in the Senate.\n\n As to \"Mr. Roddins of Rhode Island\" he has been leader republican in this state, since the first administration of Mir. Jefferson, and has repeatedly been supp ported by that party as a candidate for state offices. We commend to the perusal of the Editor of the Telegraph pamph- let written by Mir. Robbins in 1911, de- lending the policy of MT. Madison.\n\n It is, in our estimation, perfectly ridi- ulous to attempt to revive these forgotten distinctions between parties that no longer exist. We rejoice to find that the present Administration is supported by the liber- al men of both the old parties, and that the true distinction now is honesty, capablity, faithfulnes to the Constitution, without reference to the badges of party. This it is that the opposition dread so much. They act purely as politcial -partizans and mercinaries, and he among them who has no honest claim to reward for his services, can look for reward only under leader who is pledged to elevate his own parti- zans merely because they are such. We should not have noticed this wild statement of the Telegraph, but for the purpose of correcting so gross perversion of fact\n\n If this be specimen of the truth that pre- vails in the colums of that paper, its dis cipleS must be in most alarming state of ignorance-Prov.

DEAR UNcLE-I have made number of voyages in your good ship Union, and l admire her accommodations, her sailing, and the good order which has usually prevailed on board but from what have lately overheard, I\" understand that some part of our crew are clamouring for a change of officers, which if effected may produce trouble. IL appears that their de- sign is to turn out tie present Pilot out of his birth, and make pilot of the Gunner, who is as bold man as ever pointed can- non, but boldness is not the qualification for which pilot is most valued. and l hope you will excuse me, Uncle, if say that in the characteristic of Pilot, that aI ounce of circumspection is of more wortf than pound of boldness, if they could be both weighed. Your pilot has long studi- ed to make himself acquainted with the native shoals, and with foreign straits, and his attention is so devoted to the Chart an d Compass, that when I turn in at night, I feel as safe, as if was landed on Terra- Firma. Since I have been on board the Union, her guns have rairly been fired ex- cept for rejoicing, and I hope they never will be heard for any other purpose, but if your Gunner should be showed into the Pilots place, his fondness for the cannon's sound, may possibly lead him to indulge his favorite amusement, at the hazard of the ships Company. My fears have led me to make these remarks, which l hope you will excuse from Your respect",

He said \"he had never seen case in which the provocation for a battery was greater than the present-that if abusive language could ever be a justi6ca- tion for battery, this was that case-that ' the traverser was engaged in trade sanctioned by the laws of Maryland, and that Lundy had no right to reproach hin in such abusive language for carrying on lawful trade-that the trade itself was ben efcial to the state, as it removed great many rogues and vagabonds who were a nuisance in the state-that Lundy had re- 1 ceived no more than nerited reinstatement for his abuse of the traverser, and but for strict letter of the law, the Court would not fine Woollfolk any thing. The court however was obliged to fine him something, and they fined him one dollar and costs !'' pRTEn",

            "article": "draw the old party lines in reference to the present Administration and the presses in that interest affect an amusing exclusive ness to the claim of being the organs of the old republican party. To show the talsity of this assertion, tho fact has been stated that but one man of the old Feder- al party, Mir. Mills, of Massachusetts, is attached to the Administration in the Sem ate, while it is notorious, that Messrs. Tazewell, Berrien, Rowan, Ridgely, Me Lane, and we believe some others, are the principal leaders of the Opposition in the Senate, every one of whom were identi- fled with the federal party during the ad ministration of Jefferson and Madison. The Leading paper of the Opposition, the Washington Telegraph, is rather puzzled at this state of the case, and to help the matter has got up list of the members of the Senate, friendly to the Administration, who, according to its story, are of the true Hortford Contention stamp! Our readers will be much amused to learn that this for midahle list is thus made out. After nam- ing Mir. Mills, the Telegraph says-\"We now add to that list\" Ia list, by the way having but one name upon it) \"Mr. Har- rison, of Ohio, MT. Noble, of Indiana, MT. ROBBINS, of Rhode Island, and Clay ton, of Delaware. All of thase are the 1 advocates of MT. Adams, and although they were not all as much identified with the Hartford Convention as Mir. Mills, the editors of the Intelligencer know that they are federalists.\"\n\n As to Mir. Harrison, ever body knows he was appointed governor of the North Western Territory by MT. Jefferson, and Noble has represented Indiana Ia repub- lican state) in the Senate ever since she was admitted iuto the Union. MT. Clay ton undoubtedly ranked as federalist, but he is no longer in the Senate.\n\n As to \"Mr. Roddins of Rhode Island\" he has been leader republican in this state, since the first administration of Mir. Jefferson, and has repeatedly been supp ported by that party as a candidate for state offices. We commend to the perusal of the Editor of the Telegraph pamph- let written by Mir. Robbins in 1911, de- lending the policy of MT. Madison.\n\n It is, in our estimation, perfectly ridi- ulous to attempt to revive these forgotten distinctions between parties that no longer exist. We rejoice to find that the present Administration is supported by the liber- al men of both the old parties, and that the true distinction now is honesty, capablity, faithfulnes to the Constitution, without reference to the badges of party. This it is that the opposition dread so much. They act purely as politcial -partizans and mercinaries, and he among them who has no honest claim to reward for his services, can look for reward only under leader who is pledged to elevate his own parti- zans merely because they are such. We should not have noticed this wild statement of the Telegraph, but for the purpose of correcting so gross perversion of fact\n\n If this be specimen of the truth that pre- vails in the colums of that paper, its dis cipleS must be in most alarming state of ignorance-Prov. Amer.\n\n Letter from Jack Tar to his Uncle Sam. DEAR UNcLE-I have made number of voyages in your good ship Union, and l admire her accommodations, her sailing, and the good order which has usually prevailed on board but from what have lately overheard, I\" understand that some part of our crew are clamouring for a change of officers, which if effected may produce trouble. IL appears that their de- sign is to turn out tie present Pilot out of his birth, and make pilot of the Gunner, who is as bold man as ever pointed can- non, but boldness is not the qualification for which pilot is most valued. and l hope you will excuse me, Uncle, if say that in the characteristic of Pilot, that aI ounce of circumspection is of more wortf than pound of boldness, if they could be both weighed. Your pilot has long studi- ed to make himself acquainted with the native shoals, and with foreign straits, and his attention is so devoted to the Chart an d Compass, that when I turn in at night, I feel as safe, as if was landed on Terra- Firma. Since I have been on board the Union, her guns have rairly been fired ex- cept for rejoicing, and I hope they never will be heard for any other purpose, but if your Gunner should be showed into the Pilots place, his fondness for the cannon's sound, may possibly lead him to indulge his favorite amusement, at the hazard of the ships Company. My fears have led me to make these remarks, which l hope you will excuse from Your respect",

Besides, the flax that is dressed without rotting, is much stronger, loses less in the manu- facture, is frmer, and softer.\n\n CatskiN Rec.\n\n Abolition of tSlaUery.-The law for the ab- olition of slavery in the state of New York, coming into force on the 4th July ensuing, ] meeting of the descendants of Africans has been held in Albany, where, on motion of Rev. MT. Paul, resolve passed to express the gra- titude of the Africans to Almighty God, by a public celebration. But as the ,chites cee- ] brate their independence on the 4th, the Afri- cans have chosen the 5th. a>\n\n 1 A society to aid the abolition of African slavery, has been formed in SmithfeId, Ohio. Within about three weeks, accounts have been received at the office of the Genius of Universal Emancipation, of the formation of twelve new associations, upon the plan of the Ant-Slavery society of Maryland.\n\n That part of the odious law of Maryland which authorizes the immediate sale, out of the state, of coloured persons convicted of petty criminal offences, has to the honour of the legislature, been repealed.\n\n The editors of the Georgia Journal, in reply to the complaint of some subscriber, who had received his paper irregularly, make the fol- lowing sensible remark:\n\n :\" If by the happening of some accident to the mail, our newspapers should fail but once l of reaching their destination, we soon hear of the complaints of subscribers. They are dis satisfied, and have reason to be so. From this they should learn to appreciate the dis { our subscription becomes due, and they fail to send it to us. If the failure of a newspa- per one week is matter of so much annoy ance to subscribers how much more reason have we to complain when there is failure week after week, and month after month, in the receipt of what is justly due us for our time and labour, expended for the amuse- ment and instruction of others\"\n\n .WoOllfolk, the noted slave-dealer, has been fined for violent assault on B. Lun- dy, editor of the Genius of U Emancipa- ton. The chief justice, however, showed his disposition to punish the innocent, if he had the power. He said \"he had never seen case in which the provocation for a battery was greater than the present-that if abusive language could ever be a justi6ca- tion for battery, this was that case-that ' the traverser was engaged in trade sanctioned by the laws of Maryland, and that Lundy had no right to reproach hin in such abusive language for carrying on lawful trade-that the trade itself was ben efcial to the state, as it removed great many rogues and vagabonds who were a nuisance in the state-that Lundy had re- 1 ceived no more than nerited reinstatement for his abuse of the traverser, and but for strict letter of the law, the Court would not fine Woollfolk any thing. The court however was obliged to fine him something, and they fined him one dollar and costs !'' pRTEn",
