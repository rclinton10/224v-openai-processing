Trees, planted fifty or one hundred\nyears since, were generally set on new land\nhighly enriched by the decayed vegetable\nproductions, which have been accommodating\nperhaps from time immemorial. The rich\nness OF the soil would, without doubt, enable\nthe trees to grow rapidly, and very abund-\nantly explain the reason of their monstrous\ngrowth.\n\n\nQ. An orchard set on the ruins of an old\none, has not this vegetable manure to lend\nthe aid that its predecessor had; consequent\nly, it is slow In its growth; small and unpro-\nductive when grown, becomes mossy, dwin-\ndies and dies or is neglected as unworthy\nthe husbandman's attention; and the cater\npillar destroys what the axe has spared\nOur climate and soil are every way calcu-\nlated for the production OF fruit III its per-\nfection and abundance, when only assisted\nby the fostering hand OF art-and it is unrea-\nsonable to anticipate harvest without pre-\nvious cultivation, the early days of our\ncountry the earth needed only the seed to be\ngown to produce a rich harvest for its DO.\nsom was enriched and softrncd by natural\nmanure.

Trees, planted fifty or one hundred\nyears since, were generally set on new land\nhighly enriched by the decayed vegetable\nproductions, which have been accommodating\nperhaps from time immemorial.
