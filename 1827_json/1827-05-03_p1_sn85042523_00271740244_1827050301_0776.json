Ho'croit, IN Ills\ntravels through Holland, France, &c. INTRO\nduces the following passagc-ot' i OK quotes\nGregory of Tours,to prove that at 'hc councli\nof Macon, the question whether women were\nor were not human beings, was hotly disput-\ned: and after much division Of sentiment, II\nwas at last solemnly declared in the council,\nthat women did not constitute par' OF the\nhuman race\"\n\n\n| Lord Kaimcs, in his History OF Man, says,\n\"Women, by the laws of Ilindostan, are not\nadmitted to be witnesses, even IN civil\ncase; and blush (adds his lordshp) to ac-\nknowledge that in Scotland the same writer\nobserves, that mot many centuries ago,\nlaw was made in England prohibiting the\nNew Testament in England to be read by\nwomen, apprentices, journeyman or serving\nmen\" If we look back to the most polish\ned nations of antiquity, We shall tnd the\ntreatment of women such as we might DC\nled to expcct from horde Of savages. They\nwe're considered as mere goods and chat\nties\" and might be bequeathed by her hus\nband. by will. to any new master.\n\n\nThe following passage, IN confirmation\nthe fact, may be found in Jones translation\nof the speeches of IsGus:-\"fet more,\nhusband might bequeath his wife (am\"uGs\nthe Athenians) like part of his estate, I.\nany man whom he chose for his succeaaor!'\nand the mother of Demosthencs was actualt\nleft by will to Aphobus, with portion 9\neighty minas. The form of such beqoes\n| is preserved in the speech of Isaus again\nStephanus, and runs thus: \"This is tine las\nwill of Pasio, the Acharucan. I give IN\nwife Archippe to Phornio, with fortune {\none talent in Peparrhethus. one talent\nAttica, house worth one hundred mina\ntogether with the female slaves, the orna\nmcnt of gold, and whatever else may be\nit.'\n\n\nd, In Greece, women were not allowed TO 8\npresent at the Olympic Games. They SC\ndom made their appearance in public, an\nc never sat at table when strangers were pre-\nent. We have already ascribed the impro'\ned condition of women in modern times\nthe progress of civilization, which by brlnj\ning the sexes more frequently into each otl\n- er's society has introduced habits OF polit\nness, which some accute writer has dehns\nto be artificial good nature. What the La\n\n\nin poet said of the effect of the arts up'\n\n\nmankind. in our opinion applies more fore\nbly, to this species of social intercourse:\n~ --\"ingenuas di dicisSe .fdctiliter art'\n\n\nEmuiiu mores, nee Sinet esse feros\"\n\n\nOne of the Expresses of Russia, was ful\n\n\nsensible Of the efficacy of this mode OF civ\n~ izing her subjects. who were not little\n\n\nwant of some reformation, as we may lea\n\n\nfrom the following passage from the wor\n\n\nof a writer whom we have already noticed\n\n\n\"Catharine Alexawna (says lord Kaime\n\n\npromoted assemblies of men and women\n\n\nmeans to polish the manners OF her su\n\n\nects.
