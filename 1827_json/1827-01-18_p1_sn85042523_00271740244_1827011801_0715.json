And though no\nwise man would \"wish to live always\" or\ncan deem it possible. yet the precise period\nnever comes, when we find ourselves SO en-\ntirely unoccupied with temporal prospects\nor pursuits, 30 totally mortified with the\nworld as to be disposed with cheerfulness to\nleave it.-Hence the business OF the world\ngoes on, which would otherwise stand still;\nand that God of whose years there can be\nno end, is carving on designs of everlasting\nmoment. by frail and short lived instruments.\nThis man makes few feeble dying efforts,\nand expires. Another comes after him,\ntakes UP the instrument which his fellow\nhad laid down, makes his stroke or TWO,\nand exprca likewise; and yet by means OF\nefforts so weak, so interrupted, and sell de-\nstroyng, the purposes OF Heaven proceed,\nthe building Of God rises, every loss is IN\nstantly repaired, every defect supplied, nc\nchasn, in the chain of Providence is permit\nted to take place.

And though no\nwise man would \"wish to live always\" or\ncan deem it possible. yet the precise period\nnever comes, when we find ourselves SO en-\ntirely unoccupied with temporal prospects\nor pursuits, 30 totally mortified with the\nworld as to be disposed with cheerfulness to\nleave it.-Hence the business OF the world\ngoes on, which would otherwise stand still;\nand that God of whose years there can be\nno end, is carving on designs of everlasting\nmoment. by frail and short lived instruments.\nThis man makes few feeble dying efforts,\nand expires. Another comes after him,\ntakes UP the instrument which his fellow\nhad laid down, makes his stroke or TWO,\nand exprca likewise; and yet by means OF\nefforts so weak, so interrupted, and sell de-\nstroyng, the purposes OF Heaven proceed,\nthe building Of God rises, every loss is IN\nstantly repaired, every defect supplied, nc\nchasn, in the chain of Providence is permit\nted to take place. Hence men are disnihed\nwith the title of fellow workers OF God, and\nthe perishing attempts OF Pcri'hng crea-\nlures, are employed i'll maturing the plans ol\ninfinite wisdom, and arc honored by the &C\nceptance and appropriation OF linn whe\n\"worketh all things after the counsel OF his\nown wilt\" What a motive to diligence,\ncxertion and perseverance\n\n\n1t is said that we may safely leave rcli-\neion to itself; and that the work OF God, II\nreally his work, will be able to stand OF itself\nand can require no human aid 1t would be\nsufficient answer to this sophism, that II\nwould be conclusive against all efforts OF all\nsects for the religious instruction and I'M\nprovcment of the human race, and would\nreduce us all, as respects religion to crea-\nlures of necessity, for why should there DC\nany preacher to teach, if it is to be commu-\n| nicated without teaching? But this is not\n\n\nthe principal either of reason or religion\n| The manifest reason is, that God always\n\n\nworks by secondary causes, and requires the\nbest exercise of our rational powers; and oul\nmeans of all kinds, both to receive religious\n| instruction for ourselves, and 10 convey 1t &c\n\n\nothers; and that in proportion as NATIONS Of\n| individuals possess these means, they are\nanswerablc to him for the due and right use\nof them. There are therefore two main\nreasons for religious instruction, the first oul\nduty to ourselves, inasmuch as God requires\nthis duty of us an act of service and homage\n\n\nto Him, and without any reference 70 tle\n\n\ncertainty of success, and secondly as duty\n\n\nto our neighhors. We are bound to maks\n\n\nthe attempt however unpromisng as an ac\n| of service, and of obedience to God, and we\nare bound TO persevere in it, because the\n\n\nslightest success is a good communicated tt\n\n\nour neighbor, and reward insured to our\n\n\nselves infinitely above all the possible cos'\n\n\nof mere money and personal pains.",

In haPpi-\ner days and fairer fortunes he had won the\naffections OF beautiful and interesting girl,\nthe daughter of the late celebrated Irish\nbarrister.
