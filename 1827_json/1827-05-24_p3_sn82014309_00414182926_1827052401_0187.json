It is not the lot of all men, placed in the same walks of life, tO secure to them selves the warmest love and respect of a large community. This was preeminently the case with Judge Holmes.

The words of inspirations, ''The poor ye shall always have with you,\" were believed by him to con- tam an important meaning. and we believe he Eever felt disposed to evade this meaning, or shrink from the dutyswhich it enioined.- In every duty in life,--as son,--a hnsband,- tather,-a judge,-a citizen,--he manifested the same amiabe disposition, tempered with stern integrity and love for truth ,-he was atiahie, yet not cOnceited, ,-hospitable, yet not ostentatious,- charitable yet not pharisaical, -pious, yet not hypocritcal. The whole of his character may be summed up in this short, comprehensive sentence, \"He was good man ;'-and although the circumstaa- ces of his death were attended with some aggravating incidents, in being called to endure pain, and suffering and death, in small pubic house, and out of the reach of those comforts and sympathies which would have consoled him in his own dwelling. his friends have the consolation of refiecting that. notwithstanding these outward affections he had peace within; and that he gave good as- surance that that Spiri. which had taught him to trust in the Redeemer, was supporting him in his passage through the dark valley and shadow of dcath.''\n\n In Windsor, Vt.

Ribeau- Ipierre, leave little hope of obtaining the consent of the Porte to their propositions, it is reported that the two Ambassadors have agreed to await an appointed day to conjointly take some very energetic step. As to Count Guileminot, his instructions do not appear to permit him to go so far, and though he has counselled the Refs Effendi to accept the propositions, of his colleagues, it is not thought that his court, which to be sure, favors in some measure the views of England and Russia respecting Greece, has formally acceeded to the conference oi April 4th, 1926.\n\n March 1.-The indirect assent given by Austria and Prussia to the proceedings of the ambassadors of Russia and England, IS confined, as it is supposed, on tho part of M. Outteufels and the Prussian Charged .Affaires, M. Milliz, to advising the Refs Effendi to accept the propositions of those two powers.

There have, belleve, aI- ways existed peculiar difficulties in this cOun- try arising from the low state Ofthis rt,which we have reason to fear cannot be immediate ly removed; and they are difficulties which do not exist in relation to the cultivation of any other art or science which is attempted in our country. Our learned men, who are eminent for their acquaintance with other branches of learning, with the exception Ofa very few individuals, know nothing at all of this-we have no professOrshps ;-and schol ars while acquiring an education are led to look upon it as science beneath their notice. Now sir, with difference and respect, Iwould wish to inform our very respectable men of learning, that there is perhaps no science 1 where they would find more room for the ex- ercise of their greatest talents, and their most persevering industry. Butwhile they contin- ue to neglect the cultivation of this delightful art, it can hardly be expected that the music of our churches can be carried to the perfec- ton which it deserves by few individuals, laboring under all the inconyeniences. and struggling against all the difficulties which are thrown in their way by that same neglect ] and indifference; and by the ignorance and stupidity of community at large. Nothing is more common than to hear parents who on other subjects speak and act with proprie ty, make use of such language as this :--\"I will send my child to the Singing School, if it will not interfere with his other studies-nay, wish him to learn to sing, but he must spend i no time except the evenings he is at school\" Strange doctrine this.-He must learn to sing, but his mind must not be occupied with his music, lest it should interrupt his proficiency in his Geography or his Arithmetic! With the same propriety might he say in relation to other schools, '' He may study Arithmetic, but it must not interfere with his other stud\n\n ies; or he may learn to read, but he must spend no time about it, lest his mind become completely occupied, and he learn nothing 1 eIsc.\" Iwould not be understood to recom- mend the study of Music, and to neglect the study of other and more common branches of education; but in the language of Scrip ture, \"these ought we to do, and not to leave the other undone.\"\n\n But here am aware the objection, want of time, will boldly stand up in my face. What, 1 Sir, do our friends and neighbours want time for doing what they already spend double the time necessary for doing Do they want time to learn to sing, when they spend winter af- ter winter in attending a Singing School merely to get rid of the time which hangs heav- fly on their hands? lift is time they want, answer, time IS the very thing wish to save for them. Are there not very many in most of our towns and parishes, who have spent more hours in Singing Meetings than they ever did in studying Arithmetic ? think there are very many. And I also think every per son well acquainted with Music will agree with me when say that the necessary rules for reading and timing Music, are much more simple in their application than the rules of Arithmetic and those arc all that a mere\n\n performer need understand.\n\n But we act as though there were some magic connected with scientific knowledge of music, with which it was dangerous for those not initiated to intermeddle. And some of us seem to suppose that such knowledge of necessity must destroy all taste for other branches oflearning, and still more, all indus l trious habits and inclinations. @\n\n l But who cannot remember the time when Geography and English Grammar were scarcely thought of as necessary in our com mon schools ?-when person who in study ing Arithmetic had 1\" gone as far as the Rule of Three,\" was considered competent for any business ?-and person who had \"been to College\" was looked upon as prodigy ?- But now the case is different. Now we think thorough knowledge of English Grammar, Arithmetic, Sc. as necessary requisites for common education; and now almost every neighborhood is furnished with one or more persons of liberal and polite education. And has our country of late been in less four ishing condition than formerly Tor if it has,",

It is not the lot of all men, placed in the same walks of life, tO secure to them selves the warmest love and respect of a large community. This was preeminently the case with Judge Holmes. In peeuniary concerns he has experienced prosperity and diversity; yet he was at all times the same liberal bene- factor of the poor, who were never driven away frem his door empty, and the same pat ron and friend of every enlightened and pub Ilc spirited undertaking Although in his lat- ter years he was not wealthy, yet no man was more willing to give both to public and private benefaciions than himself. The words of inspirations, ''The poor ye shall always have with you,\" were believed by him to con- tam an important meaning. and we believe he Eever felt disposed to evade this meaning, or shrink from the dutyswhich it enioined.- In every duty in life,--as son,--a hnsband,- tather,-a judge,-a citizen,--he manifested the same amiabe disposition, tempered with stern integrity and love for truth ,-he was atiahie, yet not cOnceited, ,-hospitable, yet not ostentatious,- charitable yet not pharisaical, -pious, yet not hypocritcal. The whole of his character may be summed up in this short, comprehensive sentence, \"He was good man ;'-and although the circumstaa- ces of his death were attended with some aggravating incidents, in being called to endure pain, and suffering and death, in small pubic house, and out of the reach of those comforts and sympathies which would have consoled him in his own dwelling. his friends have the consolation of refiecting that. notwithstanding these outward affections he had peace within; and that he gave good as- surance that that Spiri. which had taught him to trust in the Redeemer, was supporting him in his passage through the dark valley and shadow of dcath.''\n\n In Windsor, Vt.

At Madrid many laborors were employed in making cartouches, which were dispatched to Cludad Rodrigo. The Marquis of Chaves was about to make a new inroad into For tugal.\n\n ] A letter from Paris says, |\" It is now said here, that Spain still persists in her folly. with regard to projects for invading South America, and it is asserted that the Envoy Extraordinary, NJ. D'Ofalia, is commanded to make known to the British and French Governments, that it is the in- tention of the Cabinet of Madrid to send an expedition against Mexico to establish the Infant Francisco de Paula as sove- reign. Tho Court is also said to have a still more difficult task to perform, namely, to obtain the concurrence of the Courts of the Tuilleries and St.James, to the meas ure.\"\n\n The King of Prussia, by late edict, calls upon all his subjects, under penalties, to send their children to school at cer- tain age ;-and the King of Sardinia, by an .edict of nearly the same date, forbids all persons, who do not possess certain annual income, from attending the literary institutions of his kingdom.--C Christian ] Obs. 1926;\n\n Beethoven, the musical composer, whose illness has frequently been mentioned, died at Viena Feb. 26.\n\n ConStdntinople, March 7.-The access sion of Court Gulleminot, the French am bassador, to the proposal made by England and Russia, in favour of the Greeks, is now confrmed.-It is said, however, tha, the Refs Eflendi has given him, verbally, a negative answer.\n\n Const0ntinople. March 1O.-Since my last letter, which announced to you the en- ergetic conduct of the new Russian Am bassador relative to the pacification of Greece, no very important change has taken place.\n\n l The English Ambassador, M. Straitford Canning, has yet received no answer from the Divan to his note of Feb. 9th, and as the conversations of the Refs Effendi to this minister, as we'll as to M. Ribeau- Ipierre, leave little hope of obtaining the consent of the Porte to their propositions, it is reported that the two Ambassadors have agreed to await an appointed day to conjointly take some very energetic step. As to Count Guileminot, his instructions do not appear to permit him to go so far, and though he has counselled the Refs Effendi to accept the propositions, of his colleagues, it is not thought that his court, which to be sure, favors in some measure the views of England and Russia respecting Greece, has formally acceeded to the conference oi April 4th, 1926.\n\n March 1.-The indirect assent given by Austria and Prussia to the proceedings of the ambassadors of Russia and England, IS confined, as it is supposed, on tho part of M. Outteufels and the Prussian Charged .Affaires, M. Milliz, to advising the Refs Effendi to accept the propositions of those two powers. It is inferred that the court of Vienna and Berlin have acceeded, or will accecd to the protocol of the confer enccs of April 4th. All this is to be done to persuade the Porte that they will con- fine themselves to simple demonstrations The armaments continue in the ar. ! goes on witt, rapid pace. At Athens they appear to have taken favorable turn for the Greeks.\n\n ! April 18th.\n\n House Of Commons, o'cLOck.-Mr., Wynn, president of the India Board, moved that a writ of elction issue to the borough of New: port, to elect member in the room of the Hon. George Canning, who had accepted the place of first Lord of the Treasury.-[Great cheering from all parts of the House. l-Mr. Wynn then moved an adjournment to the 1st of May, in order to afford time for Mr. Can ming to frame his new cabinet, Mir. Tiernay objected, saying that time enough had been taken to form a new cabinet, and as it was understood that seven of the old members had run a,Oay, and nobody knew when they would return, it was not worth while to wait. The adjournment, however, was carried.\n\n It is impossible for us. at this distance, to conjecture who will be Mr. Canning's associ- ates. The Times of April 11th says-that he, MT. Canning, having refused to accept the station of Premier, unless with unrestrained authority to form cabinet, had carried his point, and was perfectly free.\n\n l Lord Granville, the British Ambassador at Paris, is mentioned forthe Foreign Secretary, and Mr. Scarlett as the successor of the Lord",

London papers, to the l6th of April, say that he has already selected a new cabinet, and give the following as the list:-\n\n Sir John Copely to be Lord Chancellor.

            "article": "of Church Music. There have, belleve, aI- ways existed peculiar difficulties in this cOun- try arising from the low state Ofthis rt,which we have reason to fear cannot be immediate ly removed; and they are difficulties which do not exist in relation to the cultivation of any other art or science which is attempted in our country. Our learned men, who are eminent for their acquaintance with other branches of learning, with the exception Ofa very few individuals, know nothing at all of this-we have no professOrshps ;-and schol ars while acquiring an education are led to look upon it as science beneath their notice. Now sir, with difference and respect, Iwould wish to inform our very respectable men of learning, that there is perhaps no science 1 where they would find more room for the ex- ercise of their greatest talents, and their most persevering industry. Butwhile they contin- ue to neglect the cultivation of this delightful art, it can hardly be expected that the music of our churches can be carried to the perfec- ton which it deserves by few individuals, laboring under all the inconyeniences. and struggling against all the difficulties which are thrown in their way by that same neglect ] and indifference; and by the ignorance and stupidity of community at large. Nothing is more common than to hear parents who on other subjects speak and act with proprie ty, make use of such language as this :--\"I will send my child to the Singing School, if it will not interfere with his other studies-nay, wish him to learn to sing, but he must spend i no time except the evenings he is at school\" Strange doctrine this.-He must learn to sing, but his mind must not be occupied with his music, lest it should interrupt his proficiency in his Geography or his Arithmetic! With the same propriety might he say in relation to other schools, '' He may study Arithmetic, but it must not interfere with his other stud\n\n ies; or he may learn to read, but he must spend no time about it, lest his mind become completely occupied, and he learn nothing 1 eIsc.\" Iwould not be understood to recom- mend the study of Music, and to neglect the study of other and more common branches of education; but in the language of Scrip ture, \"these ought we to do, and not to leave the other undone.\"\n\n But here am aware the objection, want of time, will boldly stand up in my face. What, 1 Sir, do our friends and neighbours want time for doing what they already spend double the time necessary for doing Do they want time to learn to sing, when they spend winter af- ter winter in attending a Singing School merely to get rid of the time which hangs heav- fly on their hands? lift is time they want, answer, time IS the very thing wish to save for them. Are there not very many in most of our towns and parishes, who have spent more hours in Singing Meetings than they ever did in studying Arithmetic ? think there are very many. And I also think every per son well acquainted with Music will agree with me when say that the necessary rules for reading and timing Music, are much more simple in their application than the rules of Arithmetic and those arc all that a mere\n\n performer need understand.\n\n But we act as though there were some magic connected with scientific knowledge of music, with which it was dangerous for those not initiated to intermeddle. And some of us seem to suppose that such knowledge of necessity must destroy all taste for other branches oflearning, and still more, all indus l trious habits and inclinations. @\n\n l But who cannot remember the time when Geography and English Grammar were scarcely thought of as necessary in our com mon schools ?-when person who in study ing Arithmetic had 1\" gone as far as the Rule of Three,\" was considered competent for any business ?-and person who had \"been to College\" was looked upon as prodigy ?- But now the case is different. Now we think thorough knowledge of English Grammar, Arithmetic, Sc. as necessary requisites for common education; and now almost every neighborhood is furnished with one or more persons of liberal and polite education. And has our country of late been in less four ishing condition than formerly Tor if it has,",

Barnes. containing, as it does, little but vague insinuation and scurrility, is justly entitled only to silent contempt. The undersigned think proper however, to submit to the public. through the medium of your next paper, the following brief statement of facts in relation to the subject alluded to. The undersigned did not bring forward the resolutions alluded to, neither had they any agency whatever in originating them, nor did they know that any such measure was con templated, until the resolutions were handed to the chair by another member.\n\n As to the state of the meeting, it consisted of full average of the number of members usually attending the annual meetings of the Medical Society of the County. The whole number who had been present during the day, with perhaps single exception were in attendance when the subject of the resolutions was discussed, and as has been published from tho records of the Society, voted unan- imously in their favour, \"smiies\" and other equally authentic sources of information to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\n WILLIAM BUEL,\n\n SAMUEL R. CHILDS. Lltchfeld, May 24th, 1927,",
