At about five min\nutes after three in the afternoon OF the 10th Au-\ngust, 1925, the barometer marked fifteen inches\nnine lines and one tenth French: and when We\nleft Coutet's house the day BEFORE it stood at rs\ninches one line and one-tenth The thermome-\nTer was tllree-fourths of degree below zero,\nReaumur. Having made notes of these observa-\ntions, Coutet pointed out the principal offsets\nworthy of notice, and most clearly to be seen\nfrom this highest point in our quarter of the\nglobe. 1t being three O'Clock, or little laters\nthe sun was in the southwest, and interrupted\nour view very much in the direction of Geneva\nand the Jura the Jura mountains formed our ho.\nrison i'll that direction. Langress, the highest\ntown in France, we could not see, although it\nhas been said that the chain Of the Alps has been\nseen from it. On the opposite side of Mont\nBlanc the Apprentices were visible for vast e1-\ntent, and the situation of Milan and Turin were\npointed out to u.s. We looked very carefully\nand with an earnest wish to discover any thing\nlike the Mediterranean sea in the line over Ge-\nnoa, but cannot say that saw it. On the side\nOf Switzerland the Jungfra', near Grindelwald,\nwas very conspicuous, as we'll as the Mont buets\nthe Diablerets, the Ghemmi, and St. Gothard;\nmore to the eastward, Mont Rosa was visible,\nwhich is 2430 toscs above the level of the sea.\nThe Valley of Chamouni, and even its little vii.\nlage, can be seen wish telescope. The convent\nof the Grand st. Bernard was hid, owing to its\nsituation among the the mountains. We could\nrot see much of the Alice Blanche, or Mont\nBlanc, Immediately at its base on that side, ow-\ning TO the various projections, which, as it weres\ngrow from its sides.\n\n\nThe day was remarkably fne-there was not\ncloud above our heads; but on many the less\ner chains Of mountains, and on the Alpennines,\nthere we're light clouds and vapour.\n\n\nCouiiet endeavoured to make me see star,\nbut either he was mistaken, or his eyes were bet.\nter than mine. walked to the extreme end OF\nthe summit, and looked over towards the MARI\ntime Alps: this Chain was very distinct. The\nlength Off the summit of Mont Blanc is two hun\ndred PAGES, and nearly level. found difiicul-\nty in measuring the width, for the sides are an inn\nmediate descent SO that did not know where\nto begin or where to finish. The whole figure\nmay be understood as a hog's-back shape.-f\nam told that the summit of this mountain has\nbeen described as forming nearly a triangle; but\nwe did not find this to be the case now 1t ie\nevident, from the drifts Of snow during the tur-\nbuent winds in winter, that its appearance may\nchange in twenty-four hours; and that which is\nof triangular form to-day may be circular tos\n\n\nmorrow. The variety and changes i'll the drifts\nOf snow on exposed plains, are sufficiently wei!\nknown to every traveller.\n\n\nEvery object seen from this summit (246O toss\nes above the level fthe sra) becomes so dimi-\nnutive, with the exception OF few principal\nmountains, and so forc-shortened, that it seems\nentirely to have changed its form and character.\n\n\nThe beautiful Ague du Midi, and those OF\nCharlnoa, the delight and admiration OF every\nstranger who visits Chamouni, are in some de.\ngree lost i'll the general confusion; ought to\nsaw in truth, that no one particular object could\nbe seen distinctly: every thing appears SO\nmassed together, that all power of distinction IS\nlost.\n\n\nWhile stationary on the summit ofMont Blanc,\nexperienced a very peculiar sensation of light.\nness Of BODY, which was also felt by some of the\n\n\nparty to whom mentioned the circumstance. 1t\nappeared as if could have passed the blade ofa\nknife under my shoes, or between them and the\nice on which | stood. mentioned this fact to\n\n\nEbel, Mt Zurich, and also to other persons whom\n\n\n| thought capable Of calculating the cause; but\n: their explanations were not satisfactory. The\nsubject will, perhaps, serve to amlse your stu\n\n\nious bours: OILY vouch for the fact. The ra-\njyity ofthe air did not affect me quite so much or\nthe summit as when laboring through the deep\n\n\nSHOWS and climbing the ascents on our passage,\n\n\nduring the ten hours were employed in as\n\n\ncendng from Les Grands Mulets.\n\n\nThe sense of hearing was not interrupted, if\nthere had been any thing to heari the smell,\nand power Of feeling, were not tllmnshedi but\n\n\nthe faculties of the mind were in less activity\nThe sky was of a very dark indigo blue; this\n\n\ndeep tint was, indeed, among the most remark\n\n\nable features we observed. Being, as we were,\nabove all yapour and thick atmosphere, which\nrises to certain height above the level of the\n\n\nearth, the medium through which we saw it was\n\n\nOF course more purei and we looked, asst were,\ninto dark ocean of infinite space. After having\nwell observed, as far as could be distinguished,\nthe principal objects within reach, and again exc\n\n\namined our glasses, the barometer was found to\n\n\nremain steady: the thermometer, however, had\n\n\nsomewhat changed, and the mercury had fallen\n\n\nvery little below the point at which it was first\nmarked, three -fourths Of degree below zero Of\nReaumur. The wind began to feshen from the\nsouthwest, and Coutet would not sufierus to re-\nmain.\n\n\nThe snow drifted from the neighbourlng noun\ntans, and was hurrying along the surface OF the\n\n\nsummit, about half way up to our knees, put\n\n\nnone of it remained on the ice where we stood.\n\n\nThis drifting snow, meeting with resistance\n\n\nsuch as the body or legs of q man, would soon ac-\ncumulatc, not greatly to his comfort.\n\n\nlhave mentioned to you before that We had\nbeen ten hours coming from the Grands Mnlets\n; \"a the spot where we now stood.

At about five min\nutes after three in the afternoon OF the 10th Au-\ngust, 1925, the barometer marked fifteen inches\nnine lines and one tenth French: and when We\nleft Coutet's house the day BEFORE it stood at rs\ninches one line and one-tenth The thermome-\nTer was tllree-fourths of degree below zero,\nReaumur. Having made notes of these observa-\ntions, Coutet pointed out the principal offsets\nworthy of notice, and most clearly to be seen\nfrom this highest point in our quarter of the\nglobe. 1t being three O'Clock, or little laters\nthe sun was in the southwest, and interrupted\nour view very much in the direction of Geneva\nand the Jura the Jura mountains formed our ho.\nrison i'll that direction. Langress, the highest\ntown in France, we could not see, although it\nhas been said that the chain Of the Alps has been\nseen from it. On the opposite side of Mont\nBlanc the Apprentices were visible for vast e1-\ntent, and the situation of Milan and Turin were\npointed out to u.s. We looked very carefully\nand with an earnest wish to discover any thing\nlike the Mediterranean sea in the line over Ge-\nnoa, but cannot say that saw it. On the side\nOf Switzerland the Jungfra', near Grindelwald,\nwas very conspicuous, as we'll as the Mont buets\nthe Diablerets, the Ghemmi, and St. Gothard;\nmore to the eastward, Mont Rosa was visible,\nwhich is 2430 toscs above the level of the sea.\nThe Valley of Chamouni, and even its little vii.\nlage, can be seen wish telescope. The convent\nof the Grand st. Bernard was hid, owing to its\nsituation among the the mountains. We could\nrot see much of the Alice Blanche, or Mont\nBlanc, Immediately at its base on that side, ow-\ning TO the various projections, which, as it weres\ngrow from its sides.\n\n\nThe day was remarkably fne-there was not\ncloud above our heads; but on many the less\ner chains Of mountains, and on the Alpennines,\nthere we're light clouds and vapour.\n\n\nCouiiet endeavoured to make me see star,\nbut either he was mistaken, or his eyes were bet.\nter than mine. walked to the extreme end OF\nthe summit, and looked over towards the MARI\ntime Alps: this Chain was very distinct. The\nlength Off the summit of Mont Blanc is two hun\ndred PAGES, and nearly level. found difiicul-\nty in measuring the width, for the sides are an inn\nmediate descent SO that did not know where\nto begin or where to finish. The whole figure\nmay be understood as a hog's-back shape.-f\nam told that the summit of this mountain has\nbeen described as forming nearly a triangle; but\nwe did not find this to be the case now 1t ie\nevident, from the drifts Of snow during the tur-\nbuent winds in winter, that its appearance may\nchange in twenty-four hours; and that which is\nof triangular form to-day may be circular tos\n\n\nmorrow. The variety and changes i'll the drifts\nOf snow on exposed plains, are sufficiently wei!\nknown to every traveller.\n\n\nEvery object seen from this summit (246O toss\nes above the level fthe sra) becomes so dimi-\nnutive, with the exception OF few principal\nmountains, and so forc-shortened, that it seems\nentirely to have changed its form and character.\n\n\nThe beautiful Ague du Midi, and those OF\nCharlnoa, the delight and admiration OF every\nstranger who visits Chamouni, are in some de.\ngree lost i'll the general confusion; ought to\nsaw in truth, that no one particular object could\nbe seen distinctly: every thing appears SO\nmassed together, that all power of distinction IS\nlost.\n\n\nWhile stationary on the summit ofMont Blanc,\nexperienced a very peculiar sensation of light.\nness Of BODY, which was also felt by some of the\n\n\nparty to whom mentioned the circumstance. 1t\nappeared as if could have passed the blade ofa\nknife under my shoes, or between them and the\nice on which | stood. mentioned this fact to\n\n\nEbel, Mt Zurich, and also to other persons whom\n\n\n| thought capable Of calculating the cause; but\n: their explanations were not satisfactory. The\nsubject will, perhaps, serve to amlse your stu\n\n\nious bours: OILY vouch for the fact. The ra-\njyity ofthe air did not affect me quite so much or\nthe summit as when laboring through the deep\n\n\nSHOWS and climbing the ascents on our passage,\n\n\nduring the ten hours were employed in as\n\n\ncendng from Les Grands Mulets.\n\n\nThe sense of hearing was not interrupted, if\nthere had been any thing to heari the smell,\nand power Of feeling, were not tllmnshedi but\n\n\nthe faculties of the mind were in less activity\nThe sky was of a very dark indigo blue; this\n\n\ndeep tint was, indeed, among the most remark\n\n\nable features we observed. Being, as we were,\nabove all yapour and thick atmosphere, which\nrises to certain height above the level of the\n\n\nearth, the medium through which we saw it was\n\n\nOF course more purei and we looked, asst were,\ninto dark ocean of infinite space. After having\nwell observed, as far as could be distinguished,\nthe principal objects within reach, and again exc\n\n\namined our glasses, the barometer was found to\n\n\nremain steady: the thermometer, however, had\n\n\nsomewhat changed, and the mercury had fallen\n\n\nvery little below the point at which it was first\nmarked, three -fourths Of degree below zero Of\nReaumur. The wind began to feshen from the\nsouthwest, and Coutet would not sufierus to re-\nmain.\n\n\nThe snow drifted from the neighbourlng noun\ntans, and was hurrying along the surface OF the\n\n\nsummit, about half way up to our knees, put\n\n\nnone of it remained on the ice where we stood.\n\n\nThis drifting snow, meeting with resistance\n\n\nsuch as the body or legs of q man, would soon ac-\ncumulatc, not greatly to his comfort.\n\n\nlhave mentioned to you before that We had\nbeen ten hours coming from the Grands Mnlets\n; \"a the spot where we now stood.
