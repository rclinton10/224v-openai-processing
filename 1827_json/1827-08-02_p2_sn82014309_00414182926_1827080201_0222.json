            "raw_text": "Melancholy Accident.-The most unfort,i- nate incident which occurred at Trenton Falls. on Saturday, the 21st ult. has created as deep a sensation, and thrown as sad gloom upon our village, as perhaps any local occur renee within our recollection. As many diff ferent impressions may probably be enter tained by the public, and some misconception prevail. we have thought it our duty, and a melancholy one it is,to publish correct state- ment of the facts so far as they have come to our knowledge.\n\n A party ofstrangers, among whom were a MT. Sudan of New York, and his lady, two sons, and two daughters, left this village on Friday afternoon, for Trenton Falls: On Saturday morning they commenced their sur ! vey of the interesting scenery, and had arriv- ed at the fourth fall, passing in perfect safety all those points which are attended with any ! difficulty. Miss Eliza Sudan, who is the 1 subject of our notice. and her sister were un- der the charge ofa Mir. Lang, of New York, and on coming to the point where a some. what narrow passage was presented, (thOugh by no means esteemed hazardous one,) it was proposed that they should turn and re- trace their steps. To this Miss Sudan ob- iected; adding, in the fitness of buoyant spir- it's, and gratifed feeling, that she was never so delighted in her life, and wished to prolong the pleasure. Her sister at that moment re- linqushed the arm of MT. Lang, and after passing few steps with Miss Sudan, he turned his head backward to discover how the former lady was progressing, when he felt slight compression on his arm, and heard violent shriek from the sister who had re- mained behind Instantly turning to the water hn xNnrnnsuoA &cu nT hsc\n\n ion, Miss Eliza Sudam,) hut her bonnet, float ing on the top of the stream. Within the brief moment that his face had been a. | which its fall had disturbed. closed over it, \"There was rushing sound, sullen plunge and all was over. So sudden and instanta- neous was the disappearance, that no cry of agony burst from the lips of the unfortunate lady. The distress of the members compos- ing the party may be conceived--no words that we can use, could possibly convey an l. dea, ofthe sudden transition from the enjoy ment in which all had been partaking, to the | grief from whose influence no one with hu- man feelings could affect an exemption. The most unceasing efforts were now made to effect the recovery of the body; and though they were continued throughout the day, it was not until 10 o'clock on Sunday morning, that ii was found. The funeral obseques were performed in this village on the eSd, and the body, attended by multitude ofour citi- zens, whose.sympathies were strongly and ac- lively awakened by the distressing occurrence inferred in our village church yard.\n\n It may not be improper in closing our brief notice, to say that this is the first accident that ever occurred in the thousands of visits that have been made to Trenton Falls--that",

He found the greater part of his ex- petition there before him, for the random fir ing of night attack had produced llttle be- sides terror.-The dispersion of the troops, however, had been complete; they had brought home neither arms, ammunition, nor baggage. But. in default of these, they had brought abundance of exaggerated stories ofthe multitude and ferOcity ofthe en- emy. De Talinont soon returned with his corps to France.

The road, bad enough before, was now ten times worse ascents were SO slippery as to be almost inaccessible, and the descents were but so many prccipices-plunging them into so many torrents, as every rivulet had now swelIed into furious stream.

The troops were instantly closed up, and ordered to stand to their arms-but the order had scarcely been given before a shower of shot was poured in upon the position.

The word was again given to move, and the column began again to proceed down the sharp decliyity above the village of Idra but this decliyity is TOO feet by the plumb line and it may be imagined that in utter darkness, it was not the easiest path in the world for drenched and harrassed party offoreigners. They had not descended half a hundred feet, when rifle flashed full in the Colonel's face; and the signal was followed bya rapid running fire, that seemed to circle the whole valley. The column feebly attempt ed to recover the high ground, but the balls came in showers from the ridge; to make their way down to the village was as much out of the question: unless they rolled them selves down the scarped precipice, where none but dead man could ever reach the bottom tO stand where they were was in- possible, for the bullets were raking their CO., lumn in all directions. .|.\n\n The Colonel had now found out his error, and with a few desperate men made a rush to the summit The fire gradually paused on both sides from the excessive darkness, and he made good his footing, but out of his 500 not above 50 could be gathered round him / the rest had been either shot or scattered ? through the forest.

GREEcE.-It appears by the accounts which have been received from various quarters, that the affairs of this country are approaching towards favoura- ble crisis. The best authenticated statements confirm the intelligence of the Greeks, under the command of Gen. Church, Karaiskaki, Colonels Gordon, Kridreg- ger, and Coocotron, having attacked Redschid Pacha before Athens, the 18th ofAprll, and the two fol- lowing days, and after obstinate engagement peed him to abandon his entrenchments, and retreat to the distance of two hours march from the city, By this event. which it is hoped will lead to the final de- iiverance of the Acropols, the Greeks would be bied to convey an immediate supply of provisions into the Citadel. The events by are also stated to be equally favorable to the cause of the Greeks. Ten vessels, laden with warlike stores intended for the Serasker, had been taken destroyed in the Gulf of Volo.\n\n an extract from the Journal, published weekly, Hydra in the French language, under the title of Abeie Grecgue. No. 2 of the 18th of April contains the following proclamation of Lord Cochrane to the Greeks :-\n\n \"To the Committee of Government of Greece.\n\n \"A battle, glorious to the Greek cause, has been fought to day. It was commenced by the marines, who were landed on the several points of the coast of the Peninsula, Munichya) and drove before them the emies who were posted there.

He proposed and planned grand ex- petition by sea and land, which is to decide the fate of Greece by the deliverance of Athens.

It appears that party of the latter, who had surrendered in the monastery of St. Spiridon, were murdered by the Greeks in violation of the dltions on which the garrison had captulated. This horrible outrage made Gen. Church threaten to leave the army, if the guilty not punished, and the in- divduas concerned in it were arrested. After recording the above circumstances, tho &C., count proceeds to state, that durng the night of the 29th, nothing took place, but the Acropos was in the greatest distress and danger: 4OOO Greeks had mar ched towards Asomatus north of the IireGs, to at tack in the the fortified position of the Turks in the Grove ofOlves while the other corps were to at tack in front.

To this Miss Sudan ob- iected; adding, in the fitness of buoyant spir- it's, and gratifed feeling, that she was never so delighted in her life, and wished to prolong the pleasure. Her sister at that moment re- linqushed the arm of MT.

On your advance was free, and you know the rest. The flashing of the rifles showed me where you stood and, as the only chance of sav- ing you, took the liberty to make dash at your neck: It was no time for ceremony and was lucky enough in carrying you off with out being touched myself. Thisis my palace, Colonel, and here you may command\"\n\n \"And who are you, after all ?\" said the Co., lone.\n\n \"Mystery is source of the sublime,\" an- swercd the Wager; :\" that must remain a secret till better tiines.'\n\n In few days the Colonel was sent to Lay bach. He found the greater part of his ex- petition there before him, for the random fir ing of night attack had produced llttle be- sides terror.-The dispersion of the troops, however, had been complete; they had brought home neither arms, ammunition, nor baggage. But. in default of these, they had brought abundance of exaggerated stories ofthe multitude and ferOcity ofthe en- emy. De Talinont soon returned with his corps to France. He found the passes open, and the King of the Mountains true to the laws ofhospitality. But it jared indifferently with his successors His Majesty continued the wonder of Carnolia, ,and the horror of the French for years. He continually surprised and defeated the corps that attempted to beat up his quarter, until the idea was utterly aban- doned in despair.-His last exploit was that of cutting off the rear division and the whole ofthe baggage ofa French Marshall moving on to Italy. Who the Mountain King was. nobody knew he had hundred historians i; he was alternately supposed to be Hofer, who had escaped from Mantua ISteinfort, the fla nous Austrian general ofLight troops,whose body had not been found since tke battle of Austerlitz and multitude of others.

On the first order to levy troops, Lieutenant Stauenhach appeared at the court of Vienna with the offer of 5000 sharpshooters A dep utation of his companions in their mountain costume. long bearded, and with buskins and caps of wolf and bear hides, attended him.

The whole corps was in stantly en route, with gladdened hearts ; but even this had now become no trivial matter. The road, bad enough before, was now ten times worse ascents were SO slippery as to be almost inaccessible, and the descents were but so many prccipices-plunging them into so many torrents, as every rivulet had now swelIed into furious stream. The Lay bach river this night had many knapsack S pouch carried down its flood from the tribu- tary streams of the hills.\n\n In two hours afterwards,it would be morn ing, and the storm at length began to snb- side.

In moment it had disappeared,and was in another follow cd by successive lights. The Colonel was an old soldier, and had learned his first lesson in the mountain battles of the Brisgan. The troops were instantly closed up, and ordered to stand to their arms-but the order had scarcely been given before a shower of shot was poured in upon the position. Some men were knocked down close to their Colonel {; and among them the old guide. De Talmont was proyerbially brave, and cared nothing a. bout giving or taking death ; but he had humanity about him still, and he stoop- ed down to give the dying man draught of water out his canteen. The peasant swal- lowed it with difficulty, and then dropped back on the ground with deep groan. The firing had suddenly ceased, or was kept up only by the French fiankers, who sent out a randc m shot now and then, without, howey- CT, knowing on which side the assailants were to he found. The word was again given to move, and the column began again to proceed down the sharp decliyity above the village of Idra but this decliyity is TOO feet by the plumb line and it may be imagined that in utter darkness, it was not the easiest path in the world for drenched and harrassed party offoreigners. They had not descended half a hundred feet, when rifle flashed full in the Colonel's face; and the signal was followed bya rapid running fire, that seemed to circle the whole valley. The column feebly attempt ed to recover the high ground, but the balls came in showers from the ridge; to make their way down to the village was as much out of the question: unless they rolled them selves down the scarped precipice, where none but dead man could ever reach the bottom tO stand where they were was in- possible, for the bullets were raking their CO., lumn in all directions. .|.\n\n The Colonel had now found out his error, and with a few desperate men made a rush to the summit The fire gradually paused on both sides from the excessive darkness, and he made good his footing, but out of his 500 not above 50 could be gathered round him / the rest had been either shot or scattered ? through the forest. With that fifty, howev- CT, he made bold stand, and the firing began 10 be vivid again, when he felt himself sud denly grasped by the neck. The grasp was that of giant {; and he was in a moment dragged away among the rocks, until between exhaustion and surprise, he fainted.
