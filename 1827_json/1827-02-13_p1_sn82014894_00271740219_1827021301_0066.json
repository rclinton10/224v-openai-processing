Commercial .adrertiser, Feb. 6.\n\n\nTHE MoRGAN CAsE-We learn from the Wes-\ntern papers that mother convention has been held\nat Lewiston, to discover, it possible, the fate of\nMorgan. The Buffalo Patriot states that sufficient\nevidence collected t. satisfy the convention thar\nafter Morgan had been kept few days at Fort Nj\nagara, he was deliberately put to death at that place.\n\n\nThe Enquirer OF this morning gives another, and\nmore partic uar Version Of the story. on the author\nity Of a gentleman from Albany, who had read et-\nter from respectable gentleman Of Genesee, to one\nOF our senators, who states names and places III re-\nlaon to the abduction Of Morgan, which iftrue, are\nhorrible,\n\n\n\"It is said he was carried across the frontier ins\nto Canada by three persons, whose names are too\nrespectable TO hazard without strong proof; that\nan application made to Brandt, an Indian CHIEF\nand mason. to have Morgan conveyed to the North\nWest Coast but he refused to have any thing to do\nwith the affair. The persons then addressed them.\nselves to masoDs 10 the British service, TO have\nMorgan carried down the St. Lawrence and put on\nboard vessel; this was also declined; Morgan\nwas then confined. with his arms pinnned. IN the\nFort, and the gentlemen held some kind OF trial, in\nwhich it was determined to put him to death and\nthat before day break they went TO Morgan and an-\nnounced his fate, and he pleaded for light and\nbible, together with an hours delay. The report\ngoes to state tina, they cut his throat and threw\nhis body n the river. Such is the account OF his\nmysterious transaction, revesled by some one who\nknew of the affair; and whether true not, letter\ncommunicating the above, has been received by one\nof senator's and it is added, that one OF The gen.\n;lemen implicated has since given tokens of inssni-\nty. 1t Is, all round an extraordinary affair, and we\nmarvel why The heads ol the craft do not move\nn it,\n\n\nThis story NAV be true, because all things are\npossible - But we have some reasons for doubling\nil. We have this morning had conversation with\nBritish officer from Upper Canada He has recent\nly conversed with Captain Brandt-(a son OF the ce.\nlebraed Brandt OF the revolution, aud highly res-\npectable man) who knows nothing about the affair\nwhatever Besides, il is not likely that he should,\nas he does not reside at Fort George. but fifty miles\nin the interior. Our informant also that\naffairs are so situated at Fort George, that entrance\ncould not have been obtained for the purpose of\nacting that or any other tragedy. Nor was II beliey-\ned in The neighbourhood of Fort George, that Nor\ngan had ever been taken across the river, and the\nwhole matter was spoken very lightly OF among the\n\n\ninhabitants there. A,the same time justice requires\nUS to admit that there is small coincidence be-\ntween the above story and he testimony of Israel B.\nHail. given on The trial OF Sheldon and others al Ca\nnandaigua 1t stated in the story above, that an at\nempt was made at Fort George TO get some OF The\nBritish officers to carry Morgan down hs 81 Law\nrenee, and put him on board British vessel. And\nMIR. Hall testified that Cheeseboro said Morgan\nwas where Miller would not get hold OF him-tha\nhe avoided giving witness direct answers to his ques\nions, and witness thinks he said be guessed Nor\ngan was OF might be board British ship :\nThere seems TO be no doubt of the fact that Nor\ngan was traced 10 the buryng ground between Lew\nston and Fort Niagara; the carriage stopped there;\nard all afterwards is mystery.

The Buffalo Patriot states that sufficient\nevidence collected t. satisfy the convention thar\nafter Morgan had been kept few days at Fort Nj\nagara, he was deliberately put to death at that place.\n\n\nThe Enquirer OF this morning gives another, and\nmore partic uar Version Of the story. on the author\nity Of a gentleman from Albany, who had read et-\nter from respectable gentleman Of Genesee, to one\nOF our senators, who states names and places III re-\nlaon to the abduction Of Morgan, which iftrue, are\nhorrible,\n\n\n\"It is said he was carried across the frontier ins\nto Canada by three persons, whose names are too\nrespectable TO hazard without strong proof; that\nan application made to Brandt, an Indian CHIEF\nand mason. to have Morgan conveyed to the North\nWest Coast but he refused to have any thing to do\nwith the affair. The persons then addressed them.\nselves to masoDs 10 the British service, TO have\nMorgan carried down the St. Lawrence and put on\nboard vessel; this was also declined; Morgan\nwas then confined. with his arms pinnned. IN the\nFort, and the gentlemen held some kind OF trial, in\nwhich it was determined to put him to death and\nthat before day break they went TO Morgan and an-\nnounced his fate, and he pleaded for light and\nbible, together with an hours delay. The report\ngoes to state tina, they cut his throat and threw\nhis body n the river. Such is the account OF his\nmysterious transaction, revesled by some one who\nknew of the affair; and whether true not, letter\ncommunicating the above, has been received by one\nof senator's and it is added, that one OF The gen.\n;lemen implicated has since given tokens of inssni-\nty. 1t Is, all round an extraordinary affair, and we\nmarvel why The heads ol the craft do not move\nn it,\n\n\nThis story NAV be true, because all things are\npossible - But we have some reasons for doubling\nil. We have this morning had conversation with\nBritish officer from Upper Canada He has recent\nly conversed with Captain Brandt-(a son OF the ce.\nlebraed Brandt OF the revolution, aud highly res-\npectable man) who knows nothing about the affair\nwhatever Besides, il is not likely that he should,\nas he does not reside at Fort George. but fifty miles\nin the interior. Our informant also that\naffairs are so situated at Fort George, that entrance\ncould not have been obtained for the purpose of\nacting that or any other tragedy. Nor was II beliey-\ned in The neighbourhood of Fort George, that Nor\ngan had ever been taken across the river, and the\nwhole matter was spoken very lightly OF among the\n\n\ninhabitants there. A,the same time justice requires\nUS to admit that there is small coincidence be-\ntween the above story and he testimony of Israel B.\nHail. given on The trial OF Sheldon and others al Ca\nnandaigua 1t stated in the story above, that an at\nempt was made at Fort George TO get some OF The\nBritish officers to carry Morgan down hs 81 Law\nrenee, and put him on board British vessel. And\nMIR. Hall testified that Cheeseboro said Morgan\nwas where Miller would not get hold OF him-tha\nhe avoided giving witness direct answers to his ques\nions, and witness thinks he said be guessed Nor\ngan was OF might be board British ship :\nThere seems TO be no doubt of the fact that Nor\ngan was traced 10 the buryng ground between Lew\nston and Fort Niagara; the carriage stopped there;\nard all afterwards is mystery.
