It was responded to by the young Indian females, hastening to meet them. The 1 warriors joined to the exclamation, and like the shouting of jubilee, the camp rang with praise and triumph. J. X. The following are extracts from the late E. lection Sermon, preached before the Massa- chusetts Legislature, by Rev. Moses Stuart, Professor of Sacred Literature in Andover Theological Seminary.\n\n On general ground, this may be shown 1 with very little difficulty. It is a fundamen- tal principle of Christianity, that pe should tooe eur neigh5or as owrseLves. Whenever this shall be done, and wherever it shall be done, protection in the most efectuaI manner 10 the fife, liberty and property of men, will ne cessarily ensue. If we love our neghbor as ourselves, it is plain that we shall never de- signedly injure him, in respect to any of the rights which freedom bestows. We never can deny him any rights which we could venture to claim ourselves; we can take ] from him nothing, which we should not will lmgly permit him to take from us.\n\n Then the gospel has'decided too, the ques. ] ton which is our neighbor. All men are ] neghbors to each other. ''In Christ Jesus, there is neither Greek nor Jew, Barbarian nor ] Scythian, bond nor free;' all are one--one in respect to their native rights, and claims, and rank. There is no difference between the coiOret and the white man, under the empire of gospel truth. God has not only made all nations of one blood; hut he has permitted them all to claim the same relation to him he permits them to share equally in the bounties of his providence and of his grace. ] If they are abridged of any ofthese privileges, ] it is not their Creator who has abridged them, 1 but those who have abused the power which was entrusted to them, and show themselves unworthy of such trust. The Maker of heaven and earth, regards all men in the sim l pie light of mora! aUorth. External circum- stances, rank, condition, form, color, occupa- tion---every distinction of winch proud and l petty men boast, and with which they are tnflated--ls perfectly insignificant in the sight of Him, {\" who seeth not as man seeth\" In his view, the beggar in the Lazaretto, if pos sessed of a meek, humble and fal spirit, is prince; and prince who is naughty, and luxurious, and oppressive, and un5ratefu, is q beggar indeed.\n\n ] Christianity, moreover,n its very nature and genius Is republican. It is the genuine una dulterated doctrine of liberty and equality. To all men it gives liberty to exercise their efforts and desires without restraint, so far as consists with the public good; for this results 1 from the simple principle of giving to others that liberty which we may justly cialm for ourselves. There is no one thing, which Christianity forbids, that would not be detri- mental either to the public, or to the individ- ual who might practice it. All its precepts and penalties stand on this basis and they are equally applicable to all men. Whatever men may do or refuse 10 do, about submission to laws made by others like themselves, by the very nature which is given them at the creation. they are subject to the laws heav- eD. None are too high to be made the sub iects of these laws; none too low to be af- 1 fected by their control. Consequently all men are by the nature of their subjectiOn to the same laws, placed on the groun of equal 1 ity ny the Christian religioav\n\n hesitate not to say then, that Christian ity is in its very nature true liberty and equak | ity. It does not, indeed, teach us that all men possess equal talents of any kind, nor characters equally estimable. It does not maintain that all men ought to have the same influence m community, whether their chars acter he good or bad whether their intellectual powers are strong or weak. No; it recogni- Aes all of these differences among men. But still, from the very natue of the principles which it teaches, it necessarily maintains an equality Q ofobigation among all classes of men 1 to the supreme laws of heaven, and it main Etains an equality of rights among all. This is ! the only rational and true equality that ever will, or can, exist among men.\n\n Under a government, which is free upon I Christian principles, no man can be debarrcd from privileges which another is permitted to enjoy, or from claims which another is per-\n\n nitted to make, except by his own default. or disobedience to the laws of his country. Office is accessible to all, wealth is accessa-\n\n ble to all, wherever and whenever men do to others that which they would that others should do to them. All this is necessarily implied in a Christian spirit. am not ignorant, that am now treading upon ground, which is deemed sacred by a great body of our brethren in the eastern world. They will ise up, by thousands and by millions, in opposition 10 the principles which have been avowed, and demand an an swer to the question, Whether we are not to honor the king as well as to tear God? And. whether euery soul IS not subject to the po.cers aVtich De? These questions although highly important, and (from the connexion in which they stand) fearful we will not shrink from answering. We ought to do this, indeed, in the spirit of respect and affection for many",

Within these stood the wigwams\n\n forming another circle, with all intervening\n\n space, of the finest verdant lawn between\n\n them and the Notifications.\n\n 1 They appeared like circle of arbours, constructed of young trees twisted togeth- 1 CT, and bent to unite in the form of cone or dome, at the top, and as ingeniousIy covered with bark, and often in more ele- 1 gant style with mats made of reeds, stitch ed together with rhind, as to be dry and warm. An orilice at the top, emitted the smoke of the fire, in the centre of each, which presented lively and interesting 1 spectacle.\n\n l A'grand circular area within the whole,\n\n was used as, cxigcnce required.

These corrupting offals distressed\n\n the eye, and were hurtful to all but Indi-\n\n an olfactory nerves. . In another quarter, the young Indians like bFoods of grumphing quadrupeds, had crawled together in groups, in state of primitive nakedness. Not yet able to walk on all fours they sprawled and sported to- gether, rolling over each other, squeaking 1 and gabbling according to the humour of 1 the moment.\n\n Their hair which in riper years is jet l black, was blanched, and the red color of the plump urchins was considerably heigh- tened, by their exposure to tie influence of the solar rays.\n\n A rapture among the varlats about a broken arrow, and some other -playthings, called tho squuws rom the wigwams, who dashed into the group. Each plucked her particular charge. from the uproar, and tossing it over her shoulder, screamed in concert with the shriller pipes, raised to the highest key, the enraged and inquir- ing urchin.\n\n The squaws, seldom on the most ami- cable footing with each other, and kind ling with the supposed injuries of ,heir pap pooses, turned the strife towards each oth- CT. The little Indians clung like young oppossum to their mothers backs, and, grinning, spit wrath, as their guardians tore each others heads, and fought with nails and fists, till many lay routed on the ground. Such glamour in the camp, no usual thing called forth the interference of a war rior or two who smooted the tempest. The shafts of their lances Aourished about the heads of the insurgents, like forked lightning, and pelmell they went on all without distinction. Battered and routed, the whole female tribe fled, growing, and whining under their wounds, with the ur- cliins not less terrified, screaming at the top of their lungs. The dogs aroused and called together by the noise, snarled, bark ed, and joined in the pursuit, till all were hid in the interior of their wigwams. A few old indians feeble with the infirm- ities of superanuation, came tottering to the doors of their wigwsrns. Their heads were hoary and bald but the grotesque metamorphoses of dirty stubble like white boards, so disgusting among the common orders of the aged, in civilized nations, their customs had eradicated. Though e maciated and withered, they were notbow- ed like our veteran mechanics, but strait as rushes, and though their filrrowed, wrinkled, smoke bleared features, much of the Indian manly expression could bo dis ccrned.\n\n They assembled at the Sachems wig wam after staring at the prisoner, to learn the results of the deliberations at the coun- Gil fire, and discuss the politics fthe tribe, and the punishment that eaght to be awar- ded to the spy. g\n\n The attention of Capt.

Instead of being decked in all the colours of the rainbow,a coarse loose shirt comprised all the clothing ofthe Arab jockey; and the pow erful bit of the country was the only article of equipment of the horse he bestrode.

SAVANNAH, JUNE e.-'Ne this day pub fish the last drawing of the Land Lottery, which took place on the 26th uIt. making 68 drawings in all. A great dlal nf f--i>-~~'\"tion\n\n \n\n of the lottery, both in the purchase of lands and chances. or the latter, resident of this place, for $40, bought fifteen from a person who had purchased them from differ ent individuals, of which nine have drawn prizes worth at moderate estimate S2OOO-a very neat profit for single speculation. The following is more full account of an adven- ture already desc ribed: s\n\n The tract of land supposed to be the most valuable in the new territory remained in the days drawing preceding the last-Num- Der FIFTY oNE,\" in the S1st district ofMus- cogee, (drawn on the 24th inst. by female ideOt of Columbia county,) was this great prize. Every body talked of Number FIFTY oNE-it was so extremely valuable-it would command so large price. On Thursday morning expectation was on tiptoe, and the spectators kept sharp look out An hour or two before the invaluable FIFTY ONE was drawn, another .ftty ones in different dis trict of Muscogee came out. The sound of number :\" \".ffty one\" had an electrical effect every body started and stared--it was, how ever, No. 5l, in the 2d. and not in the 2lst district, and was drawn by a revolutionary soldier of Jefferson county. Nunmber .ffty one had taken so strong hold on the mind of one of the spectators. that he altogether disregarded the DISTRICT, and leaping upon his horse. was in moment out Of sight, in pursuit of the Revolutioner; ; wishing no doubt to experience the pleasure, which is afforded to every philanthropic heart,in being the first to communicate to so worthy character the full ertent of his good fortune. The unfor- nate mistake of the speculator being discov cred almost immediately, by his friends, they started after him instantly, two expresses mounted on fleet horses, with instructions to ride him down and warned him of his error. But he was not to be oyertaken-John Gil- pin, in his celebrated London race, did not go faster. In vain did the expresses urge forward their horses, in the hope of getting within hailing distance-the speculator flew before them almost with the swifthess of the wind. In two hours he was at Sanderviile,a distance of 27 miles-getting fresh horse there, and one more afterwards, he arrived at his place of destination, at least sirty.fUe miles from Milledgeville, in about .Jre hours / That road was never. before travelled with such speed ,and perhaps will not be again, un- til we have another Land Lottery. A bar gain for the land was quickly struck, and a part of the purchase money paid down, long before the arrival of either of the expresses. We are glad to learn, however, that when the mistake of the buyer had been discover ed, the revolutionary veteran cheerfully returned the money and cancelled the sale.\n\n From ahe Republican Farmer:\n\n | 4 ny WNx~",

It was responded to by the young Indian females, hastening to meet them. The 1 warriors joined to the exclamation, and like the shouting of jubilee, the camp rang with praise and triumph. J. X. The following are extracts from the late E. lection Sermon, preached before the Massa- chusetts Legislature, by Rev. Moses Stuart, Professor of Sacred Literature in Andover Theological Seminary.\n\n On general ground, this may be shown 1 with very little difficulty. It is a fundamen- tal principle of Christianity, that pe should tooe eur neigh5or as owrseLves. Whenever this shall be done, and wherever it shall be done, protection in the most efectuaI manner 10 the fife, liberty and property of men, will ne cessarily ensue. If we love our neghbor as ourselves, it is plain that we shall never de- signedly injure him, in respect to any of the rights which freedom bestows. We never can deny him any rights which we could venture to claim ourselves; we can take ] from him nothing, which we should not will lmgly permit him to take from us.\n\n Then the gospel has'decided too, the ques. ] ton which is our neighbor. All men are ] neghbors to each other. ''In Christ Jesus, there is neither Greek nor Jew, Barbarian nor ] Scythian, bond nor free;' all are one--one in respect to their native rights, and claims, and rank. There is no difference between the coiOret and the white man, under the empire of gospel truth. God has not only made all nations of one blood; hut he has permitted them all to claim the same relation to him he permits them to share equally in the bounties of his providence and of his grace. ] If they are abridged of any ofthese privileges, ] it is not their Creator who has abridged them, 1 but those who have abused the power which was entrusted to them, and show themselves unworthy of such trust. The Maker of heaven and earth, regards all men in the sim l pie light of mora! aUorth. External circum- stances, rank, condition, form, color, occupa- tion---every distinction of winch proud and l petty men boast, and with which they are tnflated--ls perfectly insignificant in the sight of Him, {\" who seeth not as man seeth\" In his view, the beggar in the Lazaretto, if pos sessed of a meek, humble and fal spirit, is prince; and prince who is naughty, and luxurious, and oppressive, and un5ratefu, is q beggar indeed.\n\n ] Christianity, moreover,n its very nature and genius Is republican. It is the genuine una dulterated doctrine of liberty and equality. To all men it gives liberty to exercise their efforts and desires without restraint, so far as consists with the public good; for this results 1 from the simple principle of giving to others that liberty which we may justly cialm for ourselves. There is no one thing, which Christianity forbids, that would not be detri- mental either to the public, or to the individ- ual who might practice it. All its precepts and penalties stand on this basis and they are equally applicable to all men. Whatever men may do or refuse 10 do, about submission to laws made by others like themselves, by the very nature which is given them at the creation. they are subject to the laws heav- eD. None are too high to be made the sub iects of these laws; none too low to be af- 1 fected by their control. Consequently all men are by the nature of their subjectiOn to the same laws, placed on the groun of equal 1 ity ny the Christian religioav\n\n hesitate not to say then, that Christian ity is in its very nature true liberty and equak | ity. It does not, indeed, teach us that all men possess equal talents of any kind, nor characters equally estimable. It does not maintain that all men ought to have the same influence m community, whether their chars acter he good or bad whether their intellectual powers are strong or weak. No; it recogni- Aes all of these differences among men. But still, from the very natue of the principles which it teaches, it necessarily maintains an equality Q ofobigation among all classes of men 1 to the supreme laws of heaven, and it main Etains an equality of rights among all. This is ! the only rational and true equality that ever will, or can, exist among men.\n\n Under a government, which is free upon I Christian principles, no man can be debarrcd from privileges which another is permitted to enjoy, or from claims which another is per-\n\n nitted to make, except by his own default. or disobedience to the laws of his country. Office is accessible to all, wealth is accessa-\n\n ble to all, wherever and whenever men do to others that which they would that others should do to them. All this is necessarily implied in a Christian spirit. am not ignorant, that am now treading upon ground, which is deemed sacred by a great body of our brethren in the eastern world. They will ise up, by thousands and by millions, in opposition 10 the principles which have been avowed, and demand an an swer to the question, Whether we are not to honor the king as well as to tear God? And. whether euery soul IS not subject to the po.cers aVtich De? These questions although highly important, and (from the connexion in which they stand) fearful we will not shrink from answering. We ought to do this, indeed, in the spirit of respect and affection for many",

Each plucked her particular charge. from the uproar, and tossing it over her shoulder, screamed in concert with the shriller pipes, raised to the highest key, the enraged and inquir- ing urchin.\n\n The squaws, seldom on the most ami- cable footing with each other, and kind ling with the supposed injuries of ,heir pap pooses, turned the strife towards each oth- CT. The little Indians clung like young oppossum to their mothers backs, and, grinning, spit wrath, as their guardians tore each others heads, and fought with nails and fists, till many lay routed on the ground. Such glamour in the camp, no usual thing called forth the interference of a war rior or two who smooted the tempest. The shafts of their lances Aourished about the heads of the insurgents, like forked lightning, and pelmell they went on all without distinction. Battered and routed, the whole female tribe fled, growing, and whining under their wounds, with the ur- cliins not less terrified, screaming at the top of their lungs. The dogs aroused and called together by the noise, snarled, bark ed, and joined in the pursuit, till all were hid in the interior of their wigwams. A few old indians feeble with the infirm- ities of superanuation, came tottering to the doors of their wigwsrns. Their heads were hoary and bald but the grotesque metamorphoses of dirty stubble like white boards, so disgusting among the common orders of the aged, in civilized nations, their customs had eradicated. Though e maciated and withered, they were notbow- ed like our veteran mechanics, but strait as rushes, and though their filrrowed, wrinkled, smoke bleared features, much of the Indian manly expression could bo dis ccrned.\n\n They assembled at the Sachems wig wam after staring at the prisoner, to learn the results of the deliberations at the coun- Gil fire, and discuss the politics fthe tribe, and the punishment that eaght to be awar- ded to the spy. g\n\n The attention of Capt.

He soon found the person to whom Ne was refer red, and made known to him the object of his visit. The pretended owner of the paper mill no sooner heard the name of his agent mentioned than he discovered the hoax, and entered himself into the design to carry it on. He told the fellow that it was true that he had paper mill in Troy, and that he was in want of more workmen, remarking thatl could employ none but such as could do the finest kind ofwork.

SAVANNAH, JUNE e.-'Ne this day pub fish the last drawing of the Land Lottery, which took place on the 26th uIt. making 68 drawings in all.

The following is more full account of an adven- ture already desc ribed: s\n\n The tract of land supposed to be the most valuable in the new territory remained in the days drawing preceding the last-Num- Der FIFTY oNE,\" in the S1st district ofMus- cogee, (drawn on the 24th inst. by female ideOt of Columbia county,) was this great prize. Every body talked of Number FIFTY oNE-it was so extremely valuable-it would command so large price. On Thursday morning expectation was on tiptoe, and the spectators kept sharp look out An hour or two before the invaluable FIFTY ONE was drawn, another .ftty ones in different dis trict of Muscogee came out. The sound of number :\" \".ffty one\" had an electrical effect every body started and stared--it was, how ever, No. 5l, in the 2d. and not in the 2lst district, and was drawn by a revolutionary soldier of Jefferson county. Nunmber .ffty one had taken so strong hold on the mind of one of the spectators. that he altogether disregarded the DISTRICT, and leaping upon his horse. was in moment out Of sight, in pursuit of the Revolutioner; ; wishing no doubt to experience the pleasure, which is afforded to every philanthropic heart,in being the first to communicate to so worthy character the full ertent of his good fortune. The unfor- nate mistake of the speculator being discov cred almost immediately, by his friends, they started after him instantly, two expresses mounted on fleet horses, with instructions to ride him down and warned him of his error. But he was not to be oyertaken-John Gil- pin, in his celebrated London race, did not go faster. In vain did the expresses urge forward their horses, in the hope of getting within hailing distance-the speculator flew before them almost with the swifthess of the wind. In two hours he was at Sanderviile,a distance of 27 miles-getting fresh horse there, and one more afterwards, he arrived at his place of destination, at least sirty.fUe miles from Milledgeville, in about .Jre hours / That road was never. before travelled with such speed ,and perhaps will not be again, un- til we have another Land Lottery. A bar gain for the land was quickly struck, and a part of the purchase money paid down, long before the arrival of either of the expresses. We are glad to learn, however, that when the mistake of the buyer had been discover ed, the revolutionary veteran cheerfully returned the money and cancelled the sale.\n\n From ahe Republican Farmer:\n\n | 4 ny WNx~",
