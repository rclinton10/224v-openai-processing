In fact, we would as soon un-\ndertake to form a Republic of the Cherokee\nnation, as of some Of the South American\nProvinces. The Cherokee population in\n1924, exclusive Of blacks, was 3789 OF\nthese, something more than one-third re-\ntanned the original manners and habits OF\ntheir nation, and from their love of hunting,\nand aversion to labor, they will no doubt be,\nere long, persuaded to migrate to the West,\nand join their friends beyond the Mssissip-\npl The remainder consisting of all those\nVINO have any love for improvement in the\narts of civilized life, are determined to live\naud die in the land of their forefathers.

But, It was not until\nearly in the last century, that a rule was de-\nGnitely adopted, that no member OF the So\nciety should hold fellow being in bondage.\nThis article of their discipline, which - a.\ndopted throughout the Union, has in many\ninstances, subjected the society and lndivld-\nuals to great expense and inconvenience,\nowing to the obstacles thrown 10 the way OF\nemancipation by the laws OF most OF the\nSouthern States. These require that II\nmaster sets slave free, he shall remove\nhim from the State, or give heavy bonds to\nguard against his ever be ecomns chargeable,\nand also. we believe, hold the master still\naccountable for any misconduct OF the eman'\ncpated slave.\n\n\nWith these requsitinns. it was impnssi'\nbic for many individuals to comply, and the\nburthen consequently devolved on the ooci'\netv. 1t was most felt in the Yearly Meeting\nof North Carolina, where the number oi\nslaves who fell into their hands was great\nest.

A donation of $500 has been\nmade to the Colonization Society towards\nchartering vessel tor Liberia, and $500\nmore is pledged if necessary. This vessel\nwe believe. has since sailed A further sum\not two thousand dollars was found necessary\nto complete the removal of the whole num-\nber, which has been apportonedto to be raised\namong the several Quarterly Meetings.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the address says--\"Not-\nwi,hstanding all the varied difficulties at\ntending this subject, it appears to US that\nthe blessing of Divine Providence has attend\ncd our exertions in peculiar manner.-lf\nthe Father of Mercies should continue to\nsmile on our operations, we shall in year\nor two more, in all probability, be released\nfrom the heavier part of this burthen, and\nfeel the inexpressiblc consolation of having\nplucked from the jaws of slavery, thousand\nof our fellow beings, and placed them in free\ngovernments, where they may enjoy the\nprivileges of citizens, and the additional sat-\nisfaction of having been instrumental in per-\nforming work which will doubtless have\nvery striking influence on the community\nat large, and assist in paving the way for\nthe mitigation or removal of one of the great\nest evils that ever affected the human race\"\n\n\nMassachusetts Sly.",

The most au-\nthentic statements agree in asserting that\nthe Greeks under Generals Church, Karais-\nkaki, and others, having attacked Redschid\nbefore Athens on the 18th Of April, and the\ntwo following days, had compelled him to\nretreat two hours march from the city. The\nGreeks might thus convey supplies into the\nAcrepolis, and finally, it was possible, de-\nliver it. BY sea like success had attended\nthem, ten vessels with warlike stores, in\ntended for the Seraskier. having been taken\nor destroyed in the Gulf of Volo.

Cochrane is said to have planned\na great expedition by sea and land, for the\ndeliverance of Athens, and the decision of the\nfate of Greece. 1t was confidently reported\nthat Russia had dccisively apprised the\nPorte, that the independence Of the Greeks\nmust be acknowledged, and that the appoint\ning of Capo dIstria at the head of the Greek\ngovernment, had had favorable influence\non the Russian Cabinet. The army on the\nPruth was said to be on its march towards\nthe Turkish borders. This on dit is as prob\nable as that it is in contemplation in order\nTO bring Austria in favor of the Greeks, to\nmake the son of Napoleon the King of the\nGrecian REPUBLIC. Nothing staggers the Gre\ndulity OF a continental journalist. Letters\nfrom Vienna state the argument of the\nTurkish Divan against recognising the inde-\npendence of Greece, to be the imposslbility\nOf ascertaining who are the heads of its go.\nvernment. 1t appears that party OF Turk\nish prisoners Of war, had been ,wantonly\n: butchercd by the Greeks in defiance of the\n; captulation. In consequence Of this outrage,\nGeneral Church threatened to leave the ar\nmy, if those concerned in it we're not arrest\ned. This had been done. The General had\nissued proclamation on leaving his head\nquarters at Megara, to march to Athens\nBali. finer.\n\n\nBy later .frrival.\n\n\nPARIS, June 14.-We were unwilling yester-\nday to repeat the disastrous news from Athens,\nwhich the Augsburgh Gazette gave on the faith\nof letters from syria of the 18th and 29th of May,\nreceived at Trieste on the Sd inst.

We an\nNFt\nAcropolis, if, as is stated, it has yielded to the\nexertions of the Seraskier, and if the brave Ka.\nraskaki has fallen, with three thousand of his\nmen under the walls of Athens.\n\n\nWe have the Observer of the 5th before us,\nwhich is silent as to the affairs OF Greece May\nnot this silence augur well.\n\n\nThe difference in the dates Of the two letters\nfrom Syra (the first being Of the 18th, and the\nsecond of the 29tl of Aiay) also excites some\ndoubts as to the authenticity of its intelligence.\nThe interval of ten days between the two letters\nwhich announce such important events, and\nwhich arrived at the same moment at Trieste, is\nnot explained.\n\n\nThe followingis is an extract of another letter\n1 from Trieste, dated the Sd of June:-\n\n\n| srhe AcropoIis still held out on the 18th of\nMay, after the sangunary defeat OF the Greek ar\nmy 1t was reported at Syria that the Greek Ad-\nmiral dc Rigny and Com, Hamilton had arrived\nat the Pireus for the purpose of obtaining an\nhonorable capitlaton for the brave defenders\nof the Acropolis, but the Seraskier WIS not dis\nposed to grant it. No circumstantal details of\nthe unfortunate events which have taken place\nunder the walls of Athens, are yet known; it is\nonly asccrtaned that the first attack of the\nGreeks against the camp of the Turks promised\nthe most happy result, but the Seraskier having\nduring the action, received reinforcement Of\n| 5000 men, the Greeks were compelled 70 sur\nrender\" Alas it is no longer possible for us to\ndoubt the defeat Of the Greeks before Athens;\nthis sad news is confirmed from all quarters.\n\n\n\"lt is affirmed that the details given in the\n, German journals are incorrect; but it is too true\nthat $500 Greeks have pershed. At the last\nadvces, 5000 Greeks, under Gen Church, sur\nrounded the heights of phaleres. On the 10th\nof May (tcn days after the defeat of the Greeks)\nthe Acropolic still held out. 1t was said that\n1000 Greeks had marched towards Asomato, the\nnorth Of the Pyreus in order to attack the Turks\nin the rear whilst the other corps should attack\nthem in 'front.' On the 4th Karaskaki attacked\nthe Turks and persisted, together with 500 of his\nmen. On the 9th the action took place with\nthe troops who had effected landing.

Cochrane is said to have planned\na great expedition by sea and land, for the\ndeliverance of Athens, and the decision of the\nfate of Greece. 1t was confidently reported\nthat Russia had dccisively apprised the\nPorte, that the independence Of the Greeks\nmust be acknowledged, and that the appoint\ning of Capo dIstria at the head of the Greek\ngovernment, had had favorable influence\non the Russian Cabinet. The army on the\nPruth was said to be on its march towards\nthe Turkish borders. This on dit is as prob\nable as that it is in contemplation in order\nTO bring Austria in favor of the Greeks, to\nmake the son of Napoleon the King of the\nGrecian REPUBLIC. Nothing staggers the Gre\ndulity OF a continental journalist. Letters\nfrom Vienna state the argument of the\nTurkish Divan against recognising the inde-\npendence of Greece, to be the imposslbility\nOf ascertaining who are the heads of its go.\nvernment. 1t appears that party OF Turk\nish prisoners Of war, had been ,wantonly\n: butchercd by the Greeks in defiance of the\n; captulation. In consequence Of this outrage,\nGeneral Church threatened to leave the ar\nmy, if those concerned in it we're not arrest\ned. This had been done. The General had\nissued proclamation on leaving his head\nquarters at Megara, to march to Athens\nBali. finer.\n\n\nBy later .frrival.\n\n\nPARIS, June 14.-We were unwilling yester-\nday to repeat the disastrous news from Athens,\nwhich the Augsburgh Gazette gave on the faith\nof letters from syria of the 18th and 29th of May,\nreceived at Trieste on the Sd inst. We have\nbeen in the habit Of receiving with caution eve\n~ thing which emanates from city, whose OF.\nfetal paper, under the influence of NJ. de Met\ntcrnich, often substitute its wishes for the real.\nity.

No circumstantal details of\nthe unfortunate events which have taken place\nunder the walls of Athens, are yet known; it is\nonly asccrtaned that the first attack of the\nGreeks against the camp of the Turks promised\nthe most happy result, but the Seraskier having\nduring the action, received reinforcement Of\n| 5000 men, the Greeks were compelled 70 sur\nrender\" Alas it is no longer possible for us to\ndoubt the defeat Of the Greeks before Athens;\nthis sad news is confirmed from all quarters.\n\n\n\"lt is affirmed that the details given in the\n, German journals are incorrect; but it is too true\nthat $500 Greeks have pershed. At the last\nadvces, 5000 Greeks, under Gen Church, sur\nrounded the heights of phaleres. On the 10th\nof May (tcn days after the defeat of the Greeks)\nthe Acropolic still held out. 1t was said that\n1000 Greeks had marched towards Asomato, the\nnorth Of the Pyreus in order to attack the Turks\nin the rear whilst the other corps should attack\nthem in 'front.' On the 4th Karaskaki attacked\nthe Turks and persisted, together with 500 of his\nmen. On the 9th the action took place with\nthe troops who had effected landing. Fight\nthousand men, sent by Redschid Pacha attacked\nthem and the defeat ofthe Greeks was horrible:\nof % Philhellenes, IS were killed.
