On either side of us arose\ntwo domes, larger and more beautiful than\nthe rest; and Immediately behind US tower\ned the great dome itself. A heavy ba]us-\ntrade surrounds the whole roof: in front\nstood the colossal statues of the Apostles\nWe clambered up the baustrade in order\nto take a nearer view of these sacred person.\nages, and were astonishcd to find what\n\"huge misshapen\" beings they were. What\nhad appeared from the pavement below to\nbe finely sculptured statues, now exhibited\ntheir real characters-large blocks OF stone.\nbound together with iron braces, and so\nrudely carved, that one is puzzled to tell the\ndifference between the fingers and thumbs.\nThe great dome arises directly from the\ncentre of the roof; nothing can be more ma\n| jcstic than it's appearance from this place\nsimple. beautiful and grand: nothing to dis\ngust or fatigue the eye: the more one re-\nCARDS it, the more imposing!does it become,\n| it is not like St. Paul's, too heavy for the\nroof, but stands in perfect harmony with eve-\n~ thing around. The bebolder is not start\nled with the idea of its weight; because the\nplace he stands on, is as firm as the earth it\"\nself. Between each of the windows project\ntwo pillars. In this, if any thing, there is\nfault; the pillars support nothing, and there\n| fore seem useless; but SO perfect Is the fous\nensemble, that the most fastidous taste\nwould be ashamed to find fault.\n\n\n1 The ascent of the dome commences by a\n| fight of steps ON the outside. We then en-\nter and continue the ascent by a magnificent\nstone stair way. We were first introduced\ninto the whispering gallery, which extends\narounds the interior. The communication\nof sound is perfect. The first thing that\nsurprised us on entering this gallery, was\nthe coarsncss of the Mosaic. From below,\nit appeared as fine as the pictures which a\ndorm the affairs in the interior; but from this\ngallery it has the appearance of huge pieces\n! of coIored glass, thrown carelessly upon the\nmortar. We ascended again, and after\nwearisome Journey came to the second gal\n| lery which surrounds the dome at the top OF\nthe arch: from this place, the view below Is\nterrifying; the dome recedcs from under\nyou and YOU feel as though standing on the\nbrink of frightful precipice. Though\nrailing surrounds it, our fears overcome our\nJudgment: we could not approach the rail-\ning, but shrunk back under the wall, with\nthat feeling of horror and dread winch a\nman experiences when he finds himself sud-\ndenly on precipice, over which another\nstep would plunge him. The passage no\"\nbecomes narrower. After ascending few\nminutes longer, the guide opened door,\nand told US to look down. We were now at\nthe very extreme height OF all.\n\n\n'rhc picture Of the Deity, which from the\npavement below is hardly distinguishable,\nwas within our reach; it was huge, coarse\nand inelegant. The people moving on the\npavement below. appeared less than Lillipu-\ntians. The height is so dizzy, that the\nGuide has to hold US while looking forward,\nand will not permit us to remain but two or\nthree minutes. We assembled and reached\nthe lantern, a small room above the dome,\nin which is kept an album. to insert the\nnames of yisjters Continuing our ascent,\nwe soon became involved in darkness. and\nsqueezing through a narrow passage. ana up\nn ncrpendicular iron ladder, we enter the\nball. Here terminates the journey. But the\nball is not the least wonderful apartment we\nhave visited. though not certainly the most\ncomfortable or elegant. 1t is close. dark,\nand hot; few loopholes are made to admit\nof any view. The size of this bail is sur\nprising. Standing on tiptoe. we could not\ntouch the top--twelvc men nigh. stand in it,\n\n\nWhat situation enclosed in ball, perch\ned ON the apex of lofty dome. The\nair abo''e, around and beneath us the roar\ning of the wind around this insulated apart\nmcrt. seemed to threaten its, and our safety.\n\n\nWe therefore bade it adcu, and descend\n\n\ning through the same narrow passage, stop\nned on the outside to breathe the pure air\nOf these upper regions. lofty balustrade\nsurrounds the lantern, just above the arch OF\nthe dome, enclosing wide and safe promen-\nade. From this point, magnificent pros\npcct extends on all sides. Rome, ancient\nand modern--the desolate Campagna-thc\nSabine and Tiburtine mountains-Albanus,\nsacred in classic history-Soracte like a\nwave on the curl\" in the distance-and the\nsea skrting the western horizon. all broke\nupon us at once. We could trace the Ii\nDer to its mouth-we fancied we could dis\ntinguish the spot where Eneas landed. The\nwars Of Turnnus we're fought over on the\nplain which extended below us. The tenn\nplcs of old Rome seem to arise from the ru\"\nins-cities spring up on the desolate waste\narmies were moving in and out of the gates\nthe temple of Jupiter glittered from the\ndistant summit of Albanus-the busy hum ot\nmillions that pcopled old Rome. arose in the\nair and antiquity herself threw off her dusty\nrags, and arose in all the beauty OF youth.\n| From the Neav MontklY Magazine.",

However. the point being carried mem.\ncon. the grand affair now was, as to which\nof the members had the hardihood TO an\nnounce the same to the expectant candidate\nNo one would undertake the office, for the\nannouncement was sure to produce a chal-\nlenge; and duel with fighting Fitzgerald\nhad in almost every case been fatal to his\nopponents. The general opinion, however,\nwas, that the proposer. Admiral Stewart.\nshould convey the intelligence, and that in\nas gen,eel terms as possible. But the Ad-\nmral, who was certainly OIL all proper occa-\nsions very gallant officer, was not inclined\n! to go on any such embassy. mo gentlemen,\nsaid he, proposed the fellow, because\nknew you would not admit him; but have\nno inclination to risk my life against that OF\nma(nan.\" \"But, Admiral\" replied the\nDuke of Devonshire, \"there being no white\nball in the box, he must know that youhaye\nblack balled him as well as the rest, and he\nis sure to cali you out at all events\" This\nwas poser for the poor Admiral, who sat,\nsilent for a few seconds, amidst the half\nsuppressed litter of the members; at length.\nJoining in the laugh against himself, he ex-\nclaimed, upon my soul! pleasant job I've\ngot into. D--n the fellow!--No matter\nwont go; let the waiter tell him that there\nwas one black ball, and his Dane must be\nput up again if he wishes It,\" This plan ap-\npearcd so judcious, that all concurred in its\nproprlety accordingly, he was, in few\nminutes, despatched on the mission.\n\n\nIn the mean time, Mr.. Fitzgerald showed\nevident symptoms of impatience. at being\nkept SO long from his \"dear friends\" above\nstairs; and frequently rang the bell to know\nthe state Of the poll. On the first occasion\nhe thus addressed the waiter who answered\nhis summons: \"Come here, my tight little\n| fellow; do you know if am chose yeti\" Il\nreally can't say, sir, replied the young man;\nbut III sec.\" \"There'sa nice nttle man.\nbe quick, dye see, and I'll give ye sixpence\nwhen We come with the good news\" Away\nwent the little man; but he was in no hurry\nto come back, for he. as well AS all his fel-\nlows, was sufficiently aware of Fitzgerald's\nviolent temper, and wished to come in con\ntact with him as seldom as possible.\n\n\nThe bell rang again, and to another wal\nter the impatient candidate put the same\nquestion-'Am / chose yet, 7vaiter?'-' Fhe\n5allotting is not over yet, Sir replied the\nman. Not over yeti exclaimed Fitzgerald.\nBut sure there is no use of balotting at all,\nwhen my dear friends are unanimous for me\nto come in.-Run, my man, and. let me know\nhow they are getting on\n\n\nAfter the lapse of another quarter Of an\nhour the bell rang so violently as to produce\na contest among the poor servants, as to\nwhose turn it was next to visit the lion in his\nden; and MIR.

What\nhad appeared from the pavement below to\nbe finely sculptured statues, now exhibited\ntheir real characters-large blocks OF stone.\nbound together with iron braces, and so\nrudely carved, that one is puzzled to tell the\ndifference between the fingers and thumbs.\nThe great dome arises directly from the\ncentre of the roof; nothing can be more ma\n| jcstic than it's appearance from this place\nsimple. beautiful and grand: nothing to dis\ngust or fatigue the eye: the more one re-\nCARDS it, the more imposing!does it become,\n| it is not like St. Paul's, too heavy for the\nroof, but stands in perfect harmony with eve-\n~ thing around. The bebolder is not start\nled with the idea of its weight; because the\nplace he stands on, is as firm as the earth it\"\nself. Between each of the windows project\ntwo pillars. In this, if any thing, there is\nfault; the pillars support nothing, and there\n| fore seem useless; but SO perfect Is the fous\nensemble, that the most fastidous taste\nwould be ashamed to find fault.\n\n\n1 The ascent of the dome commences by a\n| fight of steps ON the outside. We then en-\nter and continue the ascent by a magnificent\nstone stair way. We were first introduced\ninto the whispering gallery, which extends\narounds the interior. The communication\nof sound is perfect. The first thing that\nsurprised us on entering this gallery, was\nthe coarsncss of the Mosaic. From below,\nit appeared as fine as the pictures which a\ndorm the affairs in the interior; but from this\ngallery it has the appearance of huge pieces\n! of coIored glass, thrown carelessly upon the\nmortar. We ascended again, and after\nwearisome Journey came to the second gal\n| lery which surrounds the dome at the top OF\nthe arch: from this place, the view below Is\nterrifying; the dome recedcs from under\nyou and YOU feel as though standing on the\nbrink of frightful precipice. Though\nrailing surrounds it, our fears overcome our\nJudgment: we could not approach the rail-\ning, but shrunk back under the wall, with\nthat feeling of horror and dread winch a\nman experiences when he finds himself sud-\ndenly on precipice, over which another\nstep would plunge him. The passage no\"\nbecomes narrower. After ascending few\nminutes longer, the guide opened door,\nand told US to look down. We were now at\nthe very extreme height OF all.\n\n\n'rhc picture Of the Deity, which from the\npavement below is hardly distinguishable,\nwas within our reach; it was huge, coarse\nand inelegant. The people moving on the\npavement below. appeared less than Lillipu-\ntians. The height is so dizzy, that the\nGuide has to hold US while looking forward,\nand will not permit us to remain but two or\nthree minutes. We assembled and reached\nthe lantern, a small room above the dome,\nin which is kept an album. to insert the\nnames of yisjters Continuing our ascent,\nwe soon became involved in darkness. and\nsqueezing through a narrow passage. ana up\nn ncrpendicular iron ladder, we enter the\nball. Here terminates the journey. But the\nball is not the least wonderful apartment we\nhave visited. though not certainly the most\ncomfortable or elegant. 1t is close. dark,\nand hot; few loopholes are made to admit\nof any view.

The\nair abo''e, around and beneath us the roar\ning of the wind around this insulated apart\nmcrt. seemed to threaten its, and our safety.\n\n\nWe therefore bade it adcu, and descend\n\n\ning through the same narrow passage, stop\nned on the outside to breathe the pure air\nOf these upper regions. lofty balustrade\nsurrounds the lantern, just above the arch OF\nthe dome, enclosing wide and safe promen-\nade.

Accordingly, OH the\nnight in which the baloting was to take\nplace, (Which was only mere form in this\ncase, for even Keith Stewart himself had re-\nsolved to black ball him,) the dueilist ac-\ncompanied the gallant Admiral to St. James\nstreet, and waited in the room below whilst\nthe suffragcs were taking, in order to know\nthe issue.\n\n\nThe ballot was soon over, for without hes\nitation each member threw in a black-baH,\nand when the scrutiny took place, the COM\npany were not little amazed to find not c.\nven one white one among the whole num-\nber.

The general opinion, however,\nwas, that the proposer. Admiral Stewart.\nshould convey the intelligence, and that in\nas gen,eel terms as possible.

On the announcement of his errand\nto the assembly above stairs, many Of the\nmembers were panic struck; for they clear\n| iy foresaw that some disagrceable circum-\nstance was likely to be the finale of the farce\nwhich they had been playing. Mr.. Brookes\nstood silent for some minutes, waiting for\nan answer, whilst several of the members\nwhispered and laughed, in groupes, at the\nludicrous figure which they all cut. At\nlength, the Earl of March, afterwards the\nDuke of Queensbury, said aloud, d,--\"Try the\neffect of tzvo balls: hang his Irish impudence,\nif two black balls dent take effect upon him,\ndon't know what wil.' This proposition\nmet with unanimous appreciation, and Mr..\nBrookes was ordered to communicate it ac-\ncording!y.\n\n\nOn re.entcring the waiting room, Mr..\nFitzgerald rose hastily from the chair, and\nseizing him by the hand, eagerly inquired,\n\"Havr they elected me right now.

Not so however, to\nFitzgerald, who no sooner heard the pur-\nport of it than he exclaimed, \"Oh, Iperceive\nit is mistake altogether, Mr.. Brookes, and\nmust see to the rectfying of it myself\nthere's nothing like daHng with principals,\nand so I'll step up at once. and put this\nthing to rights. without any more unneces-\nsarv delay\"\n\n\nIn spite Of Mr.. Brooks rcmonstrance,\nthat his entrance into che club room was a.\ngaiust all rule and etiquette, Fitzgerald\nfound his way up stairs, threatening to\nthrow the landlord over the banisters for en-\ndeavoring to stop him. He entered the room\nwithout any further ceremony than bow.\nand saying to the members, who Indignantly\nrose up xt this most unexpected intrusion,\nYour servant gentlemen l beg you will\nbe sated.\" Walking up to the Fireplace,\nhe thus addressed Admiral Stewart $50,\nmy dear Admiral. Mr.. Brookes informs ME\nthat have been elected three times\" \"You\nhave been ballotted for, Mr., Fitzgerald. but\nam sorry to say that you have not been\nchosen\" said Steward. Well, then\" repli-\ned the duellist. \"did you black-ball me!\"--\nmy good SIR\" answered the Admiral,\nshow could you suppose such thing\"-\n\"Oh, suhhosed no such thing. my dear fell\nlow; only wanted to know who it was that\ndropped the black balls in by accident as it\nwere\"\n\n\nFitzgerald now went up to each individu-\nal member, and put the same question ser'a-\ntim, \"Did you black-ball me, sur'\" until he\nmade the round Of the whole club: and it\nmay we'll be supposed, that in every case ne\nobtained similar answers to that OF the al\nmiral. When he had finished his inquis'-\nton, he thus addressed the whole body, who\npreserved as dead and dread silence as the\nurchns at parish school do on Saturday.\nwhen the pedagogue orders A.,lf score Of\nthem to be horscd for neglectinE their catr-\nchism, which they have to repeal to the par\nson on Sunday :--\"You see, gentlemen, that\nas none of you have black -balled me, ! mast\nbe chose; and it is Misther Brookes that has\nmade the mistake.
