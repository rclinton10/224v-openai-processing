His father was\nnative of Scotland and was educated at\nthe University of Edinburgh-married in\nIreland, and emgrated to America at the\nbeginning of the centnry.-He made his first\nsettlement at Londonderry, but soon after\nremoved to Deerfeld, (now Manchester,)\nand settled on the east bank of the Mcrrl-\n\n\nmack near Amoskeag falls. On the break\n\n\ning out Of the seven years war, John Stark,\nthen 81 years of age, his brother VIII\nliam and Amos Eastman Of this town, and\nJohn Stinson OF Londonderry, while out on\na hunting excursion, on the upper branch\n\n\nes ofthis river, were surprised by the lud-\nans; Stinson was killed on the spot, East\n\n\nman and John Stark were taken prisoners.\nand William Stark escaped. Stark was\nconducted by the Indians to Francois, and\nfrom thence to Montreal !; where, after re-\n\n\nnaming four monthsin captivity, he was\npurchased by Mr.. Wheelright of Boston and\nreturned home by way Of Albany. Soou\nliter he engaged in company of Rangers,\nOf whom he was frs. commissioned lieu\ntenant and afterwards captain. Here he\nfound field suited to his daring and adven-\nturous spirit--he remained in the service till\nthe close of that war; during which he main\ntanned the confidence and friendship of the\nish general Howe until the death of\n/ that nobleman, who was killed in storming\nthe French lmes--in that sanguinary and\n/ doubtful contest, Stark was always found\n\n\ncautious on a march, vigalent in camp and\n\n\nundaunted in battle and it was probably\nowing to the experience he here acquired,\nthat invariabe success attended, so far as he\n\n\nwas concerned, his battles of the subsequent\nrevolution which separated these states from\n\n\nBritain.\n\n\nAt the close of the French war he return\ned to his fathers house, was soon after mar\nried and remained in the enjoyment Of do\n\n\nmestic life, until the report of the battle of\nLexington spread like all electric shock thro'\nthe country.

Stark, during the whole of this en-\ngagement, evinced the most consumate bra\nvery and intrepid zeal for his country and\nhis name and heioism viii live forever in\nthe annals of that cventful period. The\nnight after this battle, the works OH Winter\nHill were commenced and so jealous were\nthe soldcry, that on the morrow they pres\nented bold and commanding front, that\nkept the British in awe, and prevented fur\nther depredations.\n\n\nAfter the British evacuation of Boston,\nStark went TO the northern posts, to assist\nthe rltreating army from Quebec. On the\narrival of the army at 'Eiconlcroga, the i'm\nportant point of Mount Independence was\nassigned to his command and the artuons\ntask of fortifying that peninsula. After the\nBritish quit the lakes, he joined general\nWashington in Pennsylvania, preparatory\nto the battle Of Trenton. And here it may\nbe important to notice an event which was\nrelated on tho day of his funeral, by ven\nerab,c companion i'll arms, then present =\nand in whose veracity the most Implicit re-\nlance may be placed. 1t is well known that\njust previous to this important action, the\nAmerican army was on the point of being\nbroken up by suffering, dcsertion, and the\nexpiration OF the term of enlistment of a\nportion of the troops. A few days previous,\nthe term of the New Hampshiro troops ex\np;red:--Stark was the first to propose a re-\nengagement for six weeks:--he, for the mo-\nment, left his station as commander, and en-\ngagged as recruiting officer; and it is added,\nnot a man failed to re-engage.

Before they arrive at that highe,t\nstage of their existence, they pass through\nfour different transformations The first\nstate of a butterfly is that Of an egg--it next\nassumes the form of loathsome crawling\n7yorm-after remaining some time in this\nstate, it throws off its caterpillar skin; Ian\n\\ guishes; refuses to cat; ceases to move, and\nis shut up, as it were, in tomb. In this\nstate the animal is called chrusdiis-it is CO.\nvered with thin crust or she'll, and remains\nsometimes for six or eight months without\nmotion, and apparently without life. After\nremaining its allotted time i'll this torpid\ncondition, it begins to acquire new life and\nvigor; it bursts its imprisonment, and comes\nforth butterfly, with wings tinged with the\nmost beautiful colors. 1t mounts the air;\nit ranges from flower to flower, and seems\nto rejoice in its new and splendid existence.\n| How very different does it appear in this\nstate, from what it did in the preceding\nstages ofits existence. How unlikely did it\nseem that a rough, hairy, crawling worm,\n|\ndeath-like tolpor, and enshrouded in tomb\nshould lie reaninated, as it were, and Chan\nged into so beautiful form, and endued\nwith such powers of rapid mstion Perhaps\nthe change to be effected onthe bodies OF men,\nat the general resurrection, may not be\ngreater, nor more wonderful in its nature,\nthan are the changes which take place from\nthe first to the last stage of caterpillar's\nexistence. In such transformations, then,\nwe behold lively representation of the death\nand resurrection of righteous man. \"a\nlittle while he shall lie in the ground, as the\nseed lies in the bosom of the earth; but he\nshall be raised again, and shall never die any\nmore\"\n\n\nThere is another illustration, taken from\na consideration of the chemical changes of\nmatter, which has still more direct bearing\non the doctrine OF a re esurrection. We know\n| that substances which are invisibly incnrpo.\nrated with air, water, and other fluids, and\nwhich seem to be destroyed, may be made\nto re-appear in their original form by the\napplication of certain chemical Reagents\nFor example, put a small piece of solid cam\nphor into phial half-hlle with alcohol or\n| spirits of wine; in short time the camphor\nwill be dissolved in the fluid, and the spirits\nwill be as transparent as at first. II water\nbe now added, it will unite with the ardent\nspirit, and the camphor will be separated,\nand fall to the bottom OF the phial In this\nway the camphor may be nearly all recov-\ncred as at first; and by distillation the alco-\nhol may also be separated from the water,\nand exhibited in separate state | have\nalready noticed that carbon. which forms an\nessential part of animal and vegetable sub\nstances, is found to be not only indestrucu-\nbic by age, but, in all its combinations, which\nare Infinitely diversified, it still preserves its\nidentity. In the state OF carbonic acid 1t\nexists In union with earths and stones III un-\nbounded quantities; and though buried tor\nthousands of years beneath immense rocks\nor IN the centre of mountains, it is still car\nbonlc acid; for no sooner is it disengaged\nfrom its dormitory than it rises with all the\nlife and vigour of recent formation, not in the\nleast impaired by its torpid inactivity during\na lapse of ages The beams of the theatre\nat Hercuaneum were converted into char\ncoal, (Which is one of the compounds of car\nbon) by the lava which overtlawcd that city,\nduring an eruption of Mount Vesuvus; and\nduring the lapse OF 1T00 years, the charcoal\nhas remained as entire as ifit had been form\ned but yesterday, and it will probably con-\ntinue so to the end of the world\n\n\nIn addition to these facts it may be stated\nthat provision has been made for the res\ntoration of the fallen leaves of vegetables\nwhich rot upon the gronnd, and, to a care\nless observer, would appear to be lost forev-\ner 1t has been shown by experiment, that\nwhenever the soil becomes charged with\nsuch matter, the oxygen of the atmosphere\ncombines with it. and converts it into car\nbonic acid gas.

His father was\nnative of Scotland and was educated at\nthe University of Edinburgh-married in\nIreland, and emgrated to America at the\nbeginning of the centnry.-He made his first\nsettlement at Londonderry, but soon after\nremoved to Deerfeld, (now Manchester,)\nand settled on the east bank of the Mcrrl-\n\n\nmack near Amoskeag falls. On the break\n\n\ning out Of the seven years war, John Stark,\nthen 81 years of age, his brother VIII\nliam and Amos Eastman Of this town, and\nJohn Stinson OF Londonderry, while out on\na hunting excursion, on the upper branch\n\n\nes ofthis river, were surprised by the lud-\nans; Stinson was killed on the spot, East\n\n\nman and John Stark were taken prisoners.\nand William Stark escaped. Stark was\nconducted by the Indians to Francois, and\nfrom thence to Montreal !; where, after re-\n\n\nnaming four monthsin captivity, he was\npurchased by Mr.. Wheelright of Boston and\nreturned home by way Of Albany. Soou\nliter he engaged in company of Rangers,\nOf whom he was frs. commissioned lieu\ntenant and afterwards captain. Here he\nfound field suited to his daring and adven-\nturous spirit--he remained in the service till\nthe close of that war; during which he main\ntanned the confidence and friendship of the\nish general Howe until the death of\n/ that nobleman, who was killed in storming\nthe French lmes--in that sanguinary and\n/ doubtful contest, Stark was always found\n\n\ncautious on a march, vigalent in camp and\n\n\nundaunted in battle and it was probably\nowing to the experience he here acquired,\nthat invariabe success attended, so far as he\n\n\nwas concerned, his battles of the subsequent\nrevolution which separated these states from\n\n\nBritain.\n\n\nAt the close of the French war he return\ned to his fathers house, was soon after mar\nried and remained in the enjoyment Of do\n\n\nmestic life, until the report of the battle of\nLexington spread like all electric shock thro'\nthe country. When this report reached\nStark, he was at work IN his saw mil at\nAmoskeag Falls; he stopped his mill, went\nImmediately to his house, took his mnsket\nand with a band Of heroes, proceeded to\nCambridge. The morning after his arrival\nhe received colonc's commission and in\nless than two hours he enlisted 500 men .\nOn the memorable II of juno, at Breeds\nHill, the British soldiers felt the destructive\nhand of the back wood s-mcn of New Hamp-\nshire. Stark, during the whole of this en-\ngagement, evinced the most consumate bra\nvery and intrepid zeal for his country and\nhis name and heioism viii live forever in\nthe annals of that cventful period. The\nnight after this battle, the works OH Winter\nHill were commenced and so jealous were\nthe soldcry, that on the morrow they pres\nented bold and commanding front, that\nkept the British in awe, and prevented fur\nther depredations.\n\n\nAfter the British evacuation of Boston,\nStark went TO the northern posts, to assist\nthe rltreating army from Quebec. On the\narrival of the army at 'Eiconlcroga, the i'm\nportant point of Mount Independence was\nassigned to his command and the artuons\ntask of fortifying that peninsula. After the\nBritish quit the lakes, he joined general\nWashington in Pennsylvania, preparatory\nto the battle Of Trenton. And here it may\nbe important to notice an event which was\nrelated on tho day of his funeral, by ven\nerab,c companion i'll arms, then present =\nand in whose veracity the most Implicit re-\nlance may be placed. 1t is well known that\njust previous to this important action, the\nAmerican army was on the point of being\nbroken up by suffering, dcsertion, and the\nexpiration OF the term of enlistment of a\nportion of the troops. A few days previous,\nthe term of the New Hampshiro troops ex\np;red:--Stark was the first to propose a re-\nengagement for six weeks:--he, for the mo-\nment, left his station as commander, and en-\ngagged as recruiting officer; and it is added,\nnot a man failed to re-engage.

Before they arrive at that highe,t\nstage of their existence, they pass through\nfour different transformations The first\nstate of a butterfly is that Of an egg--it next\nassumes the form of loathsome crawling\n7yorm-after remaining some time in this\nstate, it throws off its caterpillar skin; Ian\n\\ guishes; refuses to cat; ceases to move, and\nis shut up, as it were, in tomb. In this\nstate the animal is called chrusdiis-it is CO.\nvered with thin crust or she'll, and remains\nsometimes for six or eight months without\nmotion, and apparently without life. After\nremaining its allotted time i'll this torpid\ncondition, it begins to acquire new life and\nvigor; it bursts its imprisonment, and comes\nforth butterfly, with wings tinged with the\nmost beautiful colors. 1t mounts the air;\nit ranges from flower to flower, and seems\nto rejoice in its new and splendid existence.\n| How very different does it appear in this\nstate, from what it did in the preceding\nstages ofits existence. How unlikely did it\nseem that a rough, hairy, crawling worm,\n|\ndeath-like tolpor, and enshrouded in tomb\nshould lie reaninated, as it were, and Chan\nged into so beautiful form, and endued\nwith such powers of rapid mstion Perhaps\nthe change to be effected onthe bodies OF men,\nat the general resurrection, may not be\ngreater, nor more wonderful in its nature,\nthan are the changes which take place from\nthe first to the last stage of caterpillar's\nexistence. In such transformations, then,\nwe behold lively representation of the death\nand resurrection of righteous man. \"a\nlittle while he shall lie in the ground, as the\nseed lies in the bosom of the earth; but he\nshall be raised again, and shall never die any\nmore\"\n\n\nThere is another illustration, taken from\na consideration of the chemical changes of\nmatter, which has still more direct bearing\non the doctrine OF a re esurrection. We know\n| that substances which are invisibly incnrpo.\nrated with air, water, and other fluids, and\nwhich seem to be destroyed, may be made\nto re-appear in their original form by the\napplication of certain chemical Reagents\nFor example, put a small piece of solid cam\nphor into phial half-hlle with alcohol or\n| spirits of wine; in short time the camphor\nwill be dissolved in the fluid, and the spirits\nwill be as transparent as at first. II water\nbe now added, it will unite with the ardent\nspirit, and the camphor will be separated,\nand fall to the bottom OF the phial In this\nway the camphor may be nearly all recov-\ncred as at first; and by distillation the alco-\nhol may also be separated from the water,\nand exhibited in separate state | have\nalready noticed that carbon. which forms an\nessential part of animal and vegetable sub\nstances, is found to be not only indestrucu-\nbic by age, but, in all its combinations, which\nare Infinitely diversified, it still preserves its\nidentity. In the state OF carbonic acid 1t\nexists In union with earths and stones III un-\nbounded quantities; and though buried tor\nthousands of years beneath immense rocks\nor IN the centre of mountains, it is still car\nbonlc acid; for no sooner is it disengaged\nfrom its dormitory than it rises with all the\nlife and vigour of recent formation, not in the\nleast impaired by its torpid inactivity during\na lapse of ages The beams of the theatre\nat Hercuaneum were converted into char\ncoal, (Which is one of the compounds of car\nbon) by the lava which overtlawcd that city,\nduring an eruption of Mount Vesuvus; and\nduring the lapse OF 1T00 years, the charcoal\nhas remained as entire as ifit had been form\ned but yesterday, and it will probably con-\ntinue so to the end of the world\n\n\nIn addition to these facts it may be stated\nthat provision has been made for the res\ntoration of the fallen leaves of vegetables\nwhich rot upon the gronnd, and, to a care\nless observer, would appear to be lost forev-\ner 1t has been shown by experiment, that\nwhenever the soil becomes charged with\nsuch matter, the oxygen of the atmosphere\ncombines with it. and converts it into car\nbonic acid gas.
