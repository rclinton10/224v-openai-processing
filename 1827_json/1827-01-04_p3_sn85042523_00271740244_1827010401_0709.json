There is not title in\ntbc treaty that has the most distant ailuslon to\nthat object, nor for one moment would discus\n.;op have been admitted thereon, as it lies entire\n\" ott ofthe competency of the General Govern\nmcnt. In anxiously wishing to embrace all their\nland within the limits of Georgia, every effort\nwas male to indnce them to agree to a clause to\nthat effect, in so MANY words. They promptly\nrefused, on the ground of their ignorance of the\ndirection of that line Had the dividing line be-\ntween Georgia and Alabama been established, !\nthink il highly probable that we should have\nsucceeded in obtaining their REIMBURSEMENT; the\nmore especially as perceive that, even by the\nsine run by the Georgia Commissioners, to which\ni i understood unofii cially the Alabama Com\nmissioners dsscnted, there is less than 200, 900\nacres of Indian Lands. 1t is a matter of regret\nthat any difficulty should have occurred between\nGeorgia and Alabama, in fixing their dividing\nline. as the President had designed, the moment\nthe dividing line had been established. tqupen\nfresh negotiations with the Greeks for the Pur-\nnose fprocuring any fragment of land such line\nmight have left of theirs within the limits of\nGeorgia. Without entering at all into the ,ner-\nits of the controversy between Georgia and Ala\nbama YOUR cxcellcncy must at once perceive\nthat the original difficulty 90 an entire cession\ncontinues to impede our course, and the first in\nstant that it shall be removed will be the one\nwhich the Executive will embrace to carry into\neffect, by fresh negotiations, if practicable the\nentire cession.\n\n\nhave the honor TO be, sir, your obedicnt SER\nwant.
