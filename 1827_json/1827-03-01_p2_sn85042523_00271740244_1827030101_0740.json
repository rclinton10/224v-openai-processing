Mr.. Smith of Maryland, to strike\nout the whole bill after the enacting clause,\nand to substitute other bills still pending.\nThe discussion was continded with great\nanimation, by Messrs.

Wright rose\n| in reply, when the Speaker put an end to\nthe discussion. The bills which had passed\nthrough committee on the preceding day\nwere then read a third time and passed\n\n\nThe House then went into Committee OF\nthe whole on the bill for the preservation\nand repair Of the Cumberland road. As\nthis bill was reported, it contained provis-\nion regulating the tolls, and appropriatine\nAl, GOO dollars for the repair and preservation\nOF the road. Mr.. Barney moved a Substitute\nfor this bill, which ,nerely appropriated\n10000 dollars for the repair of the road; ant\nleft the disputed question as to the power o\nCongress to erect toll gates, and collect toll:\nin the states, until next session. This wa!\nadopted in committee, but in the House the\nappropriation was reduced to $4,000 dollars\n\n\nThe substitute was supported by all th'\n\n\nfriends OF che bill, and by some who wcrt\nopposed to the erection of toll gates; ant\nthere IS no doubt that this compromise, b,\npreventing a long discussion of constitution\nal power, ensured the passage Of the bill\nthrough the House. The House came to\nresolution to take daily recess from TO\n; o'clock, during the remainder OF .he session",
