During The passage he separated from\nthe convoy by thick weather, and had frequent op-\nportunities of evadng the Brazilian vessels of\nwar. and of proceeding on his voyage to Boston,\nbringing with him the midshipman who was sent in\ncharge of his papers, had he been so disposed hut\nconhding in the perfect fairness and lawfulness of his\nproceedings, that he had not intended and had not\n\n\nin fact violated any begerent right, and that the\nCommodore Of the Brazilian squadron was also sat\n\n\nstied of the innocence of his conduct and intentions\nand trusting in the assurances he had given him to\nthis effect, he voluntarily proceeded in good faith\nwith his own to Muntevideo, and actually\n| reached there 24 hours before the convoy. Here\nhe found the U.

He accordingly pro\n\n\nceeded on board the Admral's ship and delivered\n\n\nthem to him, who said all was right, somethn:\n\n\nto that effect. His astonishment may then be i'm\n\n\nagined, on beholdng the next day, without any pre-\n\n\nvious notice or form, his vessel taken possession\n\n\nby two armed launches, brought in near the shore\n\n\nand anchored in an unsafe position, her sails un\n\n\nbent, though wet and sent on shore to rot, and thl\ngang proceeded to unhang the rudder, and dsmantl\n. the vessel This was the situation Of affairs at tn\nlast dates what may be the result can only be cor\njectured.\n\n\ny Every vessel before warned off had been give\nup, but it is apprehended the cupidity of the Ae\n\n\nmral had prevented the liberation of this vessel,\n: her cargo was of great value compared with tn\n\n\nvalue Of the cargoes, generally entering the La n;\n. ia, having cost in China more than hundred thor\n# sand dollars.
