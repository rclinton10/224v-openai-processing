From conspiracies composed of men of so much talents a. vailing themselves of thier high standing, it is not surprising that they should have swept society as with the bosom of de- Struction.\n\n When crimes of such character, att tended with such destructive consequences abound, it behooveS the tribunals of justice to gather themselves up to suit the occa- sion, and to extend as far as in them lies, the protecting arm of the law.\n\n Our mOnied institutions are the rcposi- tories of the wealth not only of our own citizens, but of those of other states and of other countries. In these are deposited the hard earnings of the industrious and the prudent; and extensive expenditures up- on them must necessarily be attended with a train of heart-rending suferings. Con- alterations of public policy, apply in this city with peculiar force, in favor of guard ing these institutions. This is the empo- rum of the country. Here to great ex- tent is centered the wealth of the nation.- For the purpose of rendering this wealth subservient to the advancement of the gen. eral welfare, experience has shown that it is very important that it be to great ex- tent vested in such institutions. That nothing is more certain than that they can- not exist but under the guardianship of in- corruptible agents: and so violent are the temptations for the commission of frauds upon such institutions, and such facilities are afforded the agents for their perpetra- tion, that considerations of public policy call loudly, whenever such cases occur, for the infict!on of exemplary punishment on the offenders.\n\n If We pass from this general view to your particular cases, we find but little to mitigate your punishment. The mischiefs which you have contributed towards bring ing upon society were many and extensive in their operation. The United States Lombard Association had bonds out at the time of it's failure, and which it was unable to redeem, to the amount of 5000, ,OoO, and the Sun Fire Insurance Company lost $24O,OOO of its funds.\n\n Whether therefore we consider your of fences with view to the depravity they indica.e: to the suffcrngs they have bro't upon society: or the future safety of the community we are most sensibly admon- ished of our responsibility to the people, who look for protection to the laws which we are called upon to administer and are penetrated with solemn conviction that there is no course left us compatible with our duty, but to nflict exemplary punish- ment upon you.\n\n fho rl o% ,f, ses which we are compelled to pass upon, has left the court without any precedent to guide its discretion. In one case, however, which was brought before the Court, with in the last year, we took occasion to ob- serve, that in fixing the sentence, we in- tended distinctly to give the people to un- derStand in what estimation we held such crimes.\n\n In contemplating your cases we have considered your former standing ill society; yet can perceive nothing in 1t to entitle you to our clemency. The miserable sons and daughters of vice may plead their ignor- ance and their necessities, and ,\" such eff feet as to draw tears from the eyes of Jus tice while she strikes. But your talents, and your station in society, afforded you commanding view of your duty, and put in your power to obtain by honest means, a respectable support. If your punishment were to be measured by the sufferngs you have produced, it would be difficult to fix our limits to it. If we consider your pun ishment with a view to tho character of the offence, the stern dictates of justice forbids that we should falter. If with view to the future safety of society, Experi- ence raises her monitory voice against you.\n\n But although nothing can be said in jus tihcation or excuse, yet your offences are far from being equally alocious. The circumstances attending the obtainment of an affidavit that the whole capital stock of the Madison Insurance Company was paid up, when not dollar of it was paid and then obtaining certificate of full stock to the amount of S175,OOO, and palming it off upon the Sun Fire Insurance Company, was an act of atrocity, which calls for the severe animadversion of the Court. This fact strikingly distinguishes the case of Charles Mowatt from that of his co-con- spirators.\n\n The making of similar affidavit by Thomas Hyatt relative to the U. s. Lom- I'll IL !",

We this day publish the names of the committee ap- pointed to investigate the subject to which the letter refers. The charge of.a partici- patton in the Mix contract, by Maj.

            "article": "found actually combining and cOnspiring together for the accomplishment of their nefariOus purposes. From conspiracies composed of men of so much talents a. vailing themselves of thier high standing, it is not surprising that they should have swept society as with the bosom of de- Struction.\n\n When crimes of such character, att tended with such destructive consequences abound, it behooveS the tribunals of justice to gather themselves up to suit the occa- sion, and to extend as far as in them lies, the protecting arm of the law.\n\n Our mOnied institutions are the rcposi- tories of the wealth not only of our own citizens, but of those of other states and of other countries. In these are deposited the hard earnings of the industrious and the prudent; and extensive expenditures up- on them must necessarily be attended with a train of heart-rending suferings. Con- alterations of public policy, apply in this city with peculiar force, in favor of guard ing these institutions. This is the empo- rum of the country. Here to great ex- tent is centered the wealth of the nation.- For the purpose of rendering this wealth subservient to the advancement of the gen. eral welfare, experience has shown that it is very important that it be to great ex- tent vested in such institutions. That nothing is more certain than that they can- not exist but under the guardianship of in- corruptible agents: and so violent are the temptations for the commission of frauds upon such institutions, and such facilities are afforded the agents for their perpetra- tion, that considerations of public policy call loudly, whenever such cases occur, for the infict!on of exemplary punishment on the offenders.\n\n If We pass from this general view to your particular cases, we find but little to mitigate your punishment. The mischiefs which you have contributed towards bring ing upon society were many and extensive in their operation. The United States Lombard Association had bonds out at the time of it's failure, and which it was unable to redeem, to the amount of 5000, ,OoO, and the Sun Fire Insurance Company lost $24O,OOO of its funds.\n\n Whether therefore we consider your of fences with view to the depravity they indica.e: to the suffcrngs they have bro't upon society: or the future safety of the community we are most sensibly admon- ished of our responsibility to the people, who look for protection to the laws which we are called upon to administer and are penetrated with solemn conviction that there is no course left us compatible with our duty, but to nflict exemplary punish- ment upon you.\n\n fho rl o% ,f, ses which we are compelled to pass upon, has left the court without any precedent to guide its discretion. In one case, however, which was brought before the Court, with in the last year, we took occasion to ob- serve, that in fixing the sentence, we in- tended distinctly to give the people to un- derStand in what estimation we held such crimes.\n\n In contemplating your cases we have considered your former standing ill society; yet can perceive nothing in 1t to entitle you to our clemency. The miserable sons and daughters of vice may plead their ignor- ance and their necessities, and ,\" such eff feet as to draw tears from the eyes of Jus tice while she strikes. But your talents, and your station in society, afforded you commanding view of your duty, and put in your power to obtain by honest means, a respectable support. If your punishment were to be measured by the sufferngs you have produced, it would be difficult to fix our limits to it. If we consider your pun ishment with a view to tho character of the offence, the stern dictates of justice forbids that we should falter. If with view to the future safety of society, Experi- ence raises her monitory voice against you.\n\n But although nothing can be said in jus tihcation or excuse, yet your offences are far from being equally alocious. The circumstances attending the obtainment of an affidavit that the whole capital stock of the Madison Insurance Company was paid up, when not dollar of it was paid and then obtaining certificate of full stock to the amount of S175,OOO, and palming it off upon the Sun Fire Insurance Company, was an act of atrocity, which calls for the severe animadversion of the Court. This fact strikingly distinguishes the case of Charles Mowatt from that of his co-con- spirators.\n\n The making of similar affidavit by Thomas Hyatt relative to the U. s. Lom- I'll IL !",

Lambert, be also imprisoned in the penitentiary for the term of one year.\n\n And that Thomas Hyatt be also impris- oned in the penitentiary for the term of two years.\n\n In our last paper we gave the letter of the Vice President to the Speaker of the House of Representatives. We this day publish the names of the committee ap- pointed to investigate the subject to which the letter refers. The charge of.a partici- patton in the Mix contract, by Maj. Van- deventer, is not new, neither is it now the first time that an allegation has appeared in the papers, that Mir. Calhoun was ac- quainted with that circumstance. The fact of participation is admitted in letter of Maj. Vandeventer, published in the Wash lngton Gazette, the predecessor of the Telegraph, on the 22d of April, 1922 and the fact that his participation was with the knowledge of MT. Calhoun, and that the contract with Mix was entered into without the usual notice being given by public advertisements, was stated in the report of the committee of the House of Representatives upon that subject, made at the close of the session, and published a. bout that time. We shall take occasion to republish the letter and report, with some l observations on the subject, in our next.- We cannot, however, refrain from express sing our regret, that the subject should have been presented to Congress att time when so much and such important business IS about to come before that body.\n\n For the present we will only observe that we think there is something in MT.

Important Bank Decision-The Court for the Correction of Errors, Sitting at Albany, confirmed on the gath ult. the judgment of the Court beio,c, declaring that note givenby Philip Wager to the Bank of Utica, and note given to the same Bank by SmalIey & Bar nard. null and void, because that in discount ing the note, the Bank agents retained the in- terest in advance, charged interest for the three days grace, and also because the Bank agents in computing the interest, calculated it at thirty days for each month, by which mode but 36O days were allowed to the year. This by decision of both Courts, was de- cared to be usury; and as such, freed the defendants from obligation to pay their own notes.\n\n 1he Napy-The commissioners of the Ma \" have advertised to receive proposals for the supply of 16,OOO sheets of copper, 11O,- 900 lbs of copper bolts, and for 500, ,OOO lbs of round, square, and flat iron.
