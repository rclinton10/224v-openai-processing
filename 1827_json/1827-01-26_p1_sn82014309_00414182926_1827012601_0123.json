Dear Sir; Since the date of my last, (Aug. 16) affairs have remained in nearly the same state as then described them to you, with this difference, however, that every day that the enemy is delayed from important operations, is day gained by the Greeks for it brings us nearer the rainy season, when they must necessarily give up, in great measure, hostile pro- ceedings.\n\n Athens has been closly invested for some time by the Albanians, under Reshed Pa- sha. In fact, he has possession of the lower town: for, the Greeks, finding it al- mostimpossible to defend the extensive cir cult of the walls, abandoned them and re- tired into the Acropolis, and body of Turks entered the place. On the 18th August,i it was resolved that an attack should be made upon them by the Greeks, who were without the town. Accordingly the Regulars, under Col. Fabvier, amounting 1 to about fifteen hundred men, and the Ir- regulars, under Canascakis, to three thou sand fell upon them, and drove them back some miles from the town, and cut them\n\n \n\n place. In this affair, the corps of Phil hellenians, composed of about 15O Euro peans, behaved in such manner as to force the admiration of Turks and Greeks. The next day, the enimy advanced again, and on the 2Oth they were again attacked and driven back. The affair lasted all day, and at dark it was arranged that the irreg- ulars should continue the pursuit, while the tactics Irregular troops] should remain in some gardens, a few miles from Athens as a Corps de rCserve. But what was the as- tonishment of Fabvier and his men, two hours after dark, when they thought the Greeks to be far in advance, to find the Turks, in vast numbers, rushing into the garden, sabre in hand, with their horrible cry of Allah-hu, and cutting bown all who opposed them. Confusion immediately succeeded.-Abattis, commander of the first battalion, either from weakness or misunderstanding, disobeyed his orders. and all retired rapidly to neighboring hill, from whence they endeavored with their four field pieces. to check the ene- my. Two of them breaking down they were obliged to leave them in the hands of the enemy, and continued their retreat to the shore opposite Salamis, where, after burying their cannon, they embarked, and crossed over to the Island, having lost a. bout 80 mon. Fabvier accused Canasca- kis of having betrayed him, but it will prob- ably turn out misunderstanding and, so far from being discouraged, the Greeks are prepairing to unite again and attack the en- imy. As for the Acropolis, the Turks cannot take it by assault: as for famine the garrison have provision for two years. Bombardment has been tried in vain, so that there remains no other way but that of mining This fear, in some measure 1; for, from tho almost perpendicular rising of the rock, on which the fortress is built, an enemy, who has possession of the town, may commence his operations almost under the feet of the besiegers; However, it would be exhibiting degree of skill and enter prise which have rarely shown in Turkish Armies,to attempt so tedious process.\n\n Ibrahim Pasha, greatly weakened and in want of endorsements, can undertake no operation more important than that ol burning villages, until the arrival of the Egyptian fleet, and this, it appears, ixde-",

While l resided with the two sis ters, the youthful gaiety and merriment with which they treated me, made me sort of voluntary slave to them both. One day when theIr father came to see us, he found me at 1 short distance from the house, drawing map 0t the surrounding country, from which af forwards formed the model now before you. was seated upon the grass beneath tree, but without my shoes upon my feet. \"How IS this, my friend ,\" said he, ''are you so ecO- nomlcal as to wear your shoes only in the city 7\" No sir\" replied. ''my shoes are Tn your daug ghters' possession: for they lay an embargo on them whenever they wish to prevent my leaving the place.\" Upon hear ing this, the good man was ready to die with laughter; then, wishing to ascertain the na- ture of the employment in which he found me engaged, he began to examne the map. Such however was his ignorance, that he was ut terly incapable of comprehending the mean ing ot 1t. At length, after many efforts, Isuc- ceeded in making him perceive in it his own house, with the lake, the mountains, and the woods. He was perfectly astonished, and al most took me for magician.\n\n The situation in which now found my self, though delightful beyond measure, could ] not, was aware, continue much longer with 1 out producing crisis that must make me ei- ther happy or miserable for the remainder of my life.\n\n The time at length arrived when it became absolutely necessary for me to take my de- parture, and without having made, even indi- rectly, the slightest intmation of my passion to her who was the object of it. Overwhel- med in the melancholy of my thoughts, lost all my former animation and gaiety of spirits, which were succeeded by q dejection that in creased every hour. Instead of proposing as usual to accompany tho sisters in their walks and diversions, would retire. almost uncon- scious of what was doing, to the shade of tree, with some paper and pencil, as if for the purpose of drawing. There would sit for hours, and find at last that had not drawn line.\n\n One morning when wrapped up in one of these melancholy moods suddenly pcrcei- ved the two sisters. approaching slowly thro' the wood in which they found me. They advanced at a little distance from each other the younger appearing to lead the way; the object of my passion cast d look towards me, and then with blush retired behind her sis ter. But the younger, with countenance full ofl life and animation, opposed her retreat and taking her again by the hand, pulled her towards me speaking to her at the same time a few words, which l could not hear, in a tone of attectionate anger. She came up to l me at last, and with her accustomed iveliness said to me, You must tell us the cause of your melancholy, or we will instantly deprive you of the honor Ofbeng our knight-errant.\" Forcing a smile to my lip, endeavored to answer her in the same lively tone, but my ] tongue failed to execute nay wish: could only utter complaint against my ill-fortune in being under the necessity of taking my de- parture in few days. \"Then you think of leaving us,\" continued the younger sister, Heaven knows,\" replied, \"how deeply the thought of being obliged to do so affects me-\" \"And do you grieve for both of us C. quaIly?\" The blush which instantly covered the face and neck of my beloved, blinded me at once to every other consideration, and, seizing her hand with transport. pressed it to nay lips-then dropped it moment to clasp within both of mine that of my kind medria tix. \"Very well, sir\" she replied, in a tone of affected gravity: !\" l see plainly how little you care for me. Nevertheless, as I am of generous temper, and feel no desire for re- venge, shall now inform thee, most sorrow full knight, that have put the question for thee to my sister, and that thou hast only to get the rank of captain forthwith, in order to be sure of obtaining the incOmparable happi- ness and exalted honour, &c.

On the road l found myself treated like a prince by all the post masters, who, at the very sound of the name of an officer cOmmis- stoned by the court. will almost lick the ground to serve him. NOrecOmmendatiOn,h however, of this kind is required to induce the upper classes to give an officer frank and hospita- ble reception. The hospitality, indeed, which | reigns through Hungary, together with the primitive simplicity and purity of manners, which at the period speak of prevailed a. mong the females of the country, will very plainly appearin the course of my narrative. Being young, soldier, and employed by the government, could scarcely fail of hay ing much attention paid to me at Presburg.- had not been long there before the season of Carnival came on: during which the no- bles are in the habit of giving public balls.- The customs of the country on this occasion are singular. Should there be garrison, or any officers in the city, they immediately re- ceive tickets of admission to the balls, without being at any trouble to procure them. The directors make a list of all who are invited ;- and if the number of men should be found to exceed that of females, they propose the names of some young ladies of their acquan- tance, which are inserted in the list to make up the deficiency. When this is done, it would be considered improper in the parents ofthe young ladies to prevent their daughters from attending the balls.\n\n \"As soon as they commenced, I became acquainted with two sisters, the ladies of P-, young women of great beauty and agreeable manners: the elder excelled in the waltz, the younger loved the country dance. was charmed with them both but soon from day to day. Yet why should I cherish or make known passion which could not terminate happily? What folly, for a young\n\n lieutenant without fortune, to think of offering his hand to young female, born :o higher and better hopes On the last day, however, of our meeting, l could do no less, as l had no acquaintance with the family of my partner, than take my leave. by saying to her, We have now danced the keruhW tor concusion) and in truth here my story ends, for shall never see you again.\" \"Not so,'' she repli- ed, with an openness of manner quite idnes- cribable,\" unless indeed you wish to run away from us. Every thing is arranged for your visiting in our family. My father knows who you are; and |, too, am more interested in the matter than, perhaps, you imagine.- Come, therefore, if you please, and visit us to- morrow\" Such innocence and simplicity won possession in moment of my whole heart; though to say the truth, the whole of it had been made captive long before. re- solved, however, at the same time most firm Iy not to abuse in the slightest degree the O. penness and simplicity of the fair object of my love.\n\n Hitherto my residence had been in the I'm perial Castle; which, as it commands, both in a geographical and military se:se, the city and the Danube, affords to the eye one of the Ioveliest prospects to be met with in Hungary. From the moment, however, in which l re- ccived the invitation l have mentioned, till that of my departure with a beating heart to pay the expected visit, Presburg and the Danube with all their beauties, had vanished | from my eyes. Scarcely upon my arrival at their fathers, had entered the house, when the two sisters, placing themselves one on each side of me, took me by the hand to in troduce me to him. In spite of the agitation ofmy mind, could scarcely forbear smiling when the good knight received me as if he had been bishop pronouncing blessing over me.\n\n Uprl my asking the reason of so unusual a ceremony, l immediately perceived by the answer given to me, the state of ignorance and superstition in which the country was sunk; for the object in making the sign of the cross over me was, they said, to prevent my entrance into their house from being attended with any iIl-fortune. Would that such a precaution could have been efectual! or that, in the room of superstitious ceremony, l could have offered prayer to Heaven capa- ble of averting the misfortunes which l was the innocent means of bringing upon the fam fly who had so hospitably received me under their roof.\n\n Ihad continued for some time 10 visit them with the freedom of \"a near relation, when one day their father said to me, My friend, have favour to ask of you. My wife is so unwel that am prevented from going to my estate in the country, as had at first intend ed.

The following lines were written by the Hon. Henry St. George Tucker, of Virginia, on being requested to know why he had ceas- ed to court the poetic muse. Days of my youth, ye have gIided away, Hairs of my youth, ye are frosted and gray, Eyes ofmy youth, your keen sight is no more. Checks of my youth, ye are furrow'd all Der, Strength of my youth. all your vgour is gone, Thoughts of my youth, your gay visions are\n\n flown.\n\n Days Of my youth, wish not your recall, Hairs of my youth, I'm content ye should fall, Eyes of my youth, ye much evil have seen, Cheeks of my youth, bath < in tears ye have\n\n been,\n\n Thoughts of my youth, ye have led me astray, Strength of my youth why lament your de-\n\n cay.\n\n Days of my age. ye will shortly he past, Pains of my age, yet awhile ye can last, Joys ofmy age, in true wisdom delight, Eyes of my age, be Religion your light, Thoughts of my age, dread ye not the cold\n\n sod,\n\n Hopes of my age be ye fix'd on your God.

Though pleasure may smile with ray more\n\n bright,\n\n It dazzles to lead astray; Like the meteor's flash twill deepen the night, When thou treadest thy lo:.ely way. But the hearth of home has constant flame, And pure as vestal fire; Twill burn, twill burn forever the same, For nature feeds the pyre. The sea of ambition is tempcst-tost, And thy hopes may vanish like foam But when sa,s are shiver'd and rudder lost Then look to the light of home. And there like star through the midnight\n\n cloud\n\n Thou shalt see the beacon bright, For never, till shining on thy shroud, Can be quenched its holy light. The sun of fame, aye twill gid the name, But the heart ne'er felt its ray; And fashions smiles that rich ones claim, Are but beams of wintry day.

Dear Sir; Since the date of my last, (Aug. 16) affairs have remained in nearly the same state as then described them to you, with this difference, however, that every day that the enemy is delayed from important operations, is day gained by the Greeks for it brings us nearer the rainy season, when they must necessarily give up, in great measure, hostile pro- ceedings.\n\n Athens has been closly invested for some time by the Albanians, under Reshed Pa- sha. In fact, he has possession of the lower town: for, the Greeks, finding it al- mostimpossible to defend the extensive cir cult of the walls, abandoned them and re- tired into the Acropolis, and body of Turks entered the place. On the 18th August,i it was resolved that an attack should be made upon them by the Greeks, who were without the town. Accordingly the Regulars, under Col. Fabvier, amounting 1 to about fifteen hundred men, and the Ir- regulars, under Canascakis, to three thou sand fell upon them, and drove them back some miles from the town, and cut them\n\n \n\n place. In this affair, the corps of Phil hellenians, composed of about 15O Euro peans, behaved in such manner as to force the admiration of Turks and Greeks. The next day, the enimy advanced again, and on the 2Oth they were again attacked and driven back. The affair lasted all day, and at dark it was arranged that the irreg- ulars should continue the pursuit, while the tactics Irregular troops] should remain in some gardens, a few miles from Athens as a Corps de rCserve. But what was the as- tonishment of Fabvier and his men, two hours after dark, when they thought the Greeks to be far in advance, to find the Turks, in vast numbers, rushing into the garden, sabre in hand, with their horrible cry of Allah-hu, and cutting bown all who opposed them. Confusion immediately succeeded.-Abattis, commander of the first battalion, either from weakness or misunderstanding, disobeyed his orders. and all retired rapidly to neighboring hill, from whence they endeavored with their four field pieces. to check the ene- my. Two of them breaking down they were obliged to leave them in the hands of the enemy, and continued their retreat to the shore opposite Salamis, where, after burying their cannon, they embarked, and crossed over to the Island, having lost a. bout 80 mon. Fabvier accused Canasca- kis of having betrayed him, but it will prob- ably turn out misunderstanding and, so far from being discouraged, the Greeks are prepairing to unite again and attack the en- imy. As for the Acropolis, the Turks cannot take it by assault: as for famine the garrison have provision for two years. Bombardment has been tried in vain, so that there remains no other way but that of mining This fear, in some measure 1; for, from tho almost perpendicular rising of the rock, on which the fortress is built, an enemy, who has possession of the town, may commence his operations almost under the feet of the besiegers; However, it would be exhibiting degree of skill and enter prise which have rarely shown in Turkish Armies,to attempt so tedious process.\n\n Ibrahim Pasha, greatly weakened and in want of endorsements, can undertake no operation more important than that ol burning villages, until the arrival of the Egyptian fleet, and this, it appears, ixde-",

While l resided with the two sis ters, the youthful gaiety and merriment with which they treated me, made me sort of voluntary slave to them both. One day when theIr father came to see us, he found me at 1 short distance from the house, drawing map 0t the surrounding country, from which af forwards formed the model now before you. was seated upon the grass beneath tree, but without my shoes upon my feet. \"How IS this, my friend ,\" said he, ''are you so ecO- nomlcal as to wear your shoes only in the city 7\" No sir\" replied. ''my shoes are Tn your daug ghters' possession: for they lay an embargo on them whenever they wish to prevent my leaving the place.\" Upon hear ing this, the good man was ready to die with laughter; then, wishing to ascertain the na- ture of the employment in which he found me engaged, he began to examne the map. Such however was his ignorance, that he was ut terly incapable of comprehending the mean ing ot 1t. At length, after many efforts, Isuc- ceeded in making him perceive in it his own house, with the lake, the mountains, and the woods. He was perfectly astonished, and al most took me for magician.\n\n The situation in which now found my self, though delightful beyond measure, could ] not, was aware, continue much longer with 1 out producing crisis that must make me ei- ther happy or miserable for the remainder of my life.\n\n The time at length arrived when it became absolutely necessary for me to take my de- parture, and without having made, even indi- rectly, the slightest intmation of my passion to her who was the object of it. Overwhel- med in the melancholy of my thoughts, lost all my former animation and gaiety of spirits, which were succeeded by q dejection that in creased every hour. Instead of proposing as usual to accompany tho sisters in their walks and diversions, would retire. almost uncon- scious of what was doing, to the shade of tree, with some paper and pencil, as if for the purpose of drawing. There would sit for hours, and find at last that had not drawn line.\n\n One morning when wrapped up in one of these melancholy moods suddenly pcrcei- ved the two sisters. approaching slowly thro' the wood in which they found me. They advanced at a little distance from each other the younger appearing to lead the way; the object of my passion cast d look towards me, and then with blush retired behind her sis ter. But the younger, with countenance full ofl life and animation, opposed her retreat and taking her again by the hand, pulled her towards me speaking to her at the same time a few words, which l could not hear, in a tone of attectionate anger. She came up to l me at last, and with her accustomed iveliness said to me, You must tell us the cause of your melancholy, or we will instantly deprive you of the honor Ofbeng our knight-errant.\" Forcing a smile to my lip, endeavored to answer her in the same lively tone, but my ] tongue failed to execute nay wish: could only utter complaint against my ill-fortune in being under the necessity of taking my de- parture in few days. \"Then you think of leaving us,\" continued the younger sister, Heaven knows,\" replied, \"how deeply the thought of being obliged to do so affects me-\" \"And do you grieve for both of us C. quaIly?\" The blush which instantly covered the face and neck of my beloved, blinded me at once to every other consideration, and, seizing her hand with transport. pressed it to nay lips-then dropped it moment to clasp within both of mine that of my kind medria tix. \"Very well, sir\" she replied, in a tone of affected gravity: !\" l see plainly how little you care for me. Nevertheless, as I am of generous temper, and feel no desire for re- venge, shall now inform thee, most sorrow full knight, that have put the question for thee to my sister, and that thou hast only to get the rank of captain forthwith, in order to be sure of obtaining the incOmparable happi- ness and exalted honour, &c.

On the road l found myself treated like a prince by all the post masters, who, at the very sound of the name of an officer cOmmis- stoned by the court. will almost lick the ground to serve him. NOrecOmmendatiOn,h however, of this kind is required to induce the upper classes to give an officer frank and hospita- ble reception. The hospitality, indeed, which | reigns through Hungary, together with the primitive simplicity and purity of manners, which at the period speak of prevailed a. mong the females of the country, will very plainly appearin the course of my narrative. Being young, soldier, and employed by the government, could scarcely fail of hay ing much attention paid to me at Presburg.- had not been long there before the season of Carnival came on: during which the no- bles are in the habit of giving public balls.- The customs of the country on this occasion are singular. Should there be garrison, or any officers in the city, they immediately re- ceive tickets of admission to the balls, without being at any trouble to procure them. The directors make a list of all who are invited ;- and if the number of men should be found to exceed that of females, they propose the names of some young ladies of their acquan- tance, which are inserted in the list to make up the deficiency. When this is done, it would be considered improper in the parents ofthe young ladies to prevent their daughters from attending the balls.\n\n \"As soon as they commenced, I became acquainted with two sisters, the ladies of P-, young women of great beauty and agreeable manners: the elder excelled in the waltz, the younger loved the country dance. was charmed with them both but soon from day to day. Yet why should I cherish or make known passion which could not terminate happily? What folly, for a young\n\n lieutenant without fortune, to think of offering his hand to young female, born :o higher and better hopes On the last day, however, of our meeting, l could do no less, as l had no acquaintance with the family of my partner, than take my leave. by saying to her, We have now danced the keruhW tor concusion) and in truth here my story ends, for shall never see you again.\" \"Not so,'' she repli- ed, with an openness of manner quite idnes- cribable,\" unless indeed you wish to run away from us. Every thing is arranged for your visiting in our family. My father knows who you are; and |, too, am more interested in the matter than, perhaps, you imagine.- Come, therefore, if you please, and visit us to- morrow\" Such innocence and simplicity won possession in moment of my whole heart; though to say the truth, the whole of it had been made captive long before. re- solved, however, at the same time most firm Iy not to abuse in the slightest degree the O. penness and simplicity of the fair object of my love.\n\n Hitherto my residence had been in the I'm perial Castle; which, as it commands, both in a geographical and military se:se, the city and the Danube, affords to the eye one of the Ioveliest prospects to be met with in Hungary. From the moment, however, in which l re- ccived the invitation l have mentioned, till that of my departure with a beating heart to pay the expected visit, Presburg and the Danube with all their beauties, had vanished | from my eyes. Scarcely upon my arrival at their fathers, had entered the house, when the two sisters, placing themselves one on each side of me, took me by the hand to in troduce me to him. In spite of the agitation ofmy mind, could scarcely forbear smiling when the good knight received me as if he had been bishop pronouncing blessing over me.\n\n Uprl my asking the reason of so unusual a ceremony, l immediately perceived by the answer given to me, the state of ignorance and superstition in which the country was sunk; for the object in making the sign of the cross over me was, they said, to prevent my entrance into their house from being attended with any iIl-fortune. Would that such a precaution could have been efectual! or that, in the room of superstitious ceremony, l could have offered prayer to Heaven capa- ble of averting the misfortunes which l was the innocent means of bringing upon the fam fly who had so hospitably received me under their roof.\n\n Ihad continued for some time 10 visit them with the freedom of \"a near relation, when one day their father said to me, My friend, have favour to ask of you. My wife is so unwel that am prevented from going to my estate in the country, as had at first intend ed.

Days of my youth, ye have gIided away, Hairs of my youth, ye are frosted and gray, Eyes ofmy youth, your keen sight is no more. Checks of my youth, ye are furrow'd all Der, Strength of my youth. all your vgour is gone, Thoughts of my youth, your gay visions are\n\n flown.\n\n Days Of my youth, wish not your recall, Hairs of my youth, I'm content ye should fall, Eyes of my youth, ye much evil have seen, Cheeks of my youth, bath < in tears ye have\n\n been,\n\n Thoughts of my youth, ye have led me astray, Strength of my youth why lament your de-\n\n cay.\n\n Days of my age. ye will shortly he past, Pains of my age, yet awhile ye can last, Joys ofmy age, in true wisdom delight, Eyes of my age, be Religion your light, Thoughts of my age, dread ye not the cold\n\n sod,\n\n Hopes of my age be ye fix'd on your God.

The sea of ambition is tempcst-tost, And thy hopes may vanish like foam But when sa,s are shiver'd and rudder lost Then look to the light of home. And there like star through the midnight\n\n cloud\n\n Thou shalt see the beacon bright, For never, till shining on thy shroud, Can be quenched its holy light.

Member on his readiness of recollection, and frankly admit ted that the continuation of the passage had the tendency ascribed to it by Sheridan, and that he had overlooked it at the moment when he gave his quotation. On the break ing up of the House, Fox, piqued himself on having some Greek, went up to Sheridan and asked him, Sheridan, how came you to be so ready with. that passage it certainly is as you say, but was not aware of it before you quoted it.\" It is unnecessary to observe, that there was no Greek Gt QU in Sheridan's inn promptu!\n\n Panthers killed.-A Monticello, N.

Our hunters have pursued them, and will give good account of them.",
