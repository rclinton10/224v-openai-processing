Harker from the unpleasant situation\nin which he has been placed by ssight Of what\nhe had said on former occasion''p If so. he has\nbeen most egregiously in error. There is vast\ndifference between preferring one man, and after\nwards supporting his more successful competitor\nwho has been constitutionally and fairly elected\nand vlllifying man in the most disgraceful man.\nner, and then turning round and supporting him\nalthough there has been no change in the disposi-\ntion or character of the person SO abused.\n\n\nWe are not ashamed to say that we still hold\nGeneral Jackson in very high estimation, and our\nthe fact that there has never appeared any thing\ndisrespectful or abusive of him in the columns Of\nthe Watchman. Nor shall there be whilst we have\nany control over them.\n\n\nAs to what \" Fair Play\" says of our conduct in\nrelation to the Democratic party, it is scarcely\nworth notice. To the interest of that party we\nhave been devoted--for its good we have made ma\nny sacrfces-and the Watchman has ever firmly\nand independently maintained the rights of the\nmajority Of that party against the Vaccinations Of\nthe factious and intriguing.

We believe\nthat :\" Fair Play\" has better knowledge Of the\n\n\nDemocratic Party. He knows that they are bo-\ndy Of intelligent and rejecting freemen, who duly\nprize the inestmable rights purchased by the blood\nOf their forefathers and who think and act for them\nselves as becomes citizens Of this great republic.\n\n\nAnd to say that we could divide or sway such men,\nis an absurdity that will not obtain credit.\n\n\nMr. Harker in his Gazette of the goth inst says\" The\n\n\nAdams stock has experienced very rapid decline within\nfew weeks in this place.

This correspondent,\nwho signs himself 6 Fair Play\" accuses US of act\ning unfairly in publishing one single paragraph\"\nto \"prove\" Mr..

Harker's opinion Of Gen. Jackson\nin 1922, attempted to misreprcsent his sentiments\nor pervert his language. But this we have not\ndone. We have only given his own words, express\nsed after mature delbcration. We would suppose\nthat the remark of Fair Play respecting the duty\nof an honest editor,' would come home to Mr..\nIIarker, as the latter has said that an honest man\ncannot be shamed by sight of what he has said\non a former OCCASION\" Now, according to Mr..\nHarker's own rule, he is not \" fan honest man''-\nfor he is ashamed to repubish what he said of Gen.\nJackson in 1892 Or, if he is an honest man, he\n\n\nIS co,oardty one, for he is afraid to republsh what\nhe then said of the General, when, in comparing him\nwith Messrs. Clay, Clinton, Adams, Calhoun and\nCrawford, he made use Of the following language.\n\n\n\"Of ALL the gentlemen named Gen jackson appears\nto to be the MOST OBJECTIONABLE. That he is\nman of energy, no one will doubt but we think that\nin chief magistrate of the United States, foe much\nergy Is extremely dangerous; AND have seen IN THE\nGENERAL snch DISREGARD FOR THE INSTITU-\nTIONS of the country, such DISPOSITION place\nhimself ABOVE IT'S iazvs, AND such an INCLINATION 10\nTRAMPLE ON THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS, when\ntbnvc tnod in wiz OWN INTEREST or\nFEELINGS. should render the citizens of the United\nStates very cautious about placing him in the first Office\nwithin their gift\"\n\n\nWe have not given up our intention to republish\nthe whole article from which the above is quoted; !;\nthough we still think that Mr.. Iiarker is under\nevery obligation which could influence gentleman,\nto be the first to present it to the public.\n\n\nHad it been merely a question Of preference\nwith Mr.. Harker, in 1922, between Gen. Jackson\nand any other candidate for the presidency, we\nshould not have charged him with inconsistency,\nor deemed him worthy Of reproach, for now sup\nporting man to whom he was then opposed\n1t is \" the reasons which Mr.. Harkcr gave for\nthat opposition, which lay him open to the charge\nof and hypocrcy, and servlity to his\nmasters, and which are always brought to mind\nwhen we see him pleading with the people to sup\nport man for the high Office of President of the\nUnited States, respecting whom he once said that\nHInc ClllZHUS SUOulu Ue CgTy CuWtoUS duUut pid-\ncling him in the first office within their gift\"\n\n\nNow the question arises, has Gen. Jackson\nchanged his disposition? If in 1929, before that\nperiod. he disregarded the institutions of his coun\ntry If he then placed himself above its laws and\nifhe then trampled the rights of others, to pro-\nmote his own interests, would he not under SINH\nlar circumstances, act as he then did\n\n\nBut in what consisted all these odious traits of\ncharacter which Mr. Harker saw in the General,\n,rd ,,,I,h Iol him IN cautinp he pp0plp auainQf\nsupporting him for the presidency Why, he dis\ncharged his duty with frmness which did HIM\nhonor, and which the emergencies of the times full\nly justified. He gave no quarters to traitors and\ntores-and he declared that if he had been com.\nmander in New England. he would have hung the\nmembers of that infamous band of blue lights who\ncomposed the Hartford Convention. For this de-\nclaration, Mr.. Harker and his correspondents\npoured upon cold Hickory\" such torrents of\nabuse as would have disgraced the veriest black\nguard in creation. After this, we ask any man if\nMr. Harker is not guilty of every charge we have\nmade against him Of inconsistency, &c. in now ad-\nvocating the cause of Gen. Jackson ? Who will\ndeny that he IS led by the nose by few men who, |\nin 1922, thought no better of Gen. Jackson than\nMr.. Harker himself did, and who are now found in\nthe ranks of his supporters only because they flat\nter themselves that their own views will be promo\nted thereby Their golden prospects vanished like\ndream when Mr.. Adams was elected, and their\noppositon to him is the effects of disappointed\nambition. The result of the next presidential\nelection may prove that they again wrong in\ntheir calculations.\n\n\nFor the information of \"Fair Play'' and the\npublic we would state that Albert Wilson, so tar\nfrom being one of the most active individuals in\nwilmington, in causing Book to be opened at\nthe Lafayette Iiotcl,' during the last Presidential\nelection, had nothing to do with procuring the Books",

Jackson, so cutting and\nsevere, that he swore off from any further notice\nof them, has procured correspondent to act as\nchampion in his defence. This correspondent,\nwho signs himself 6 Fair Play\" accuses US of act\ning unfairly in publishing one single paragraph\"\nto \"prove\" Mr.. Harkcr's \" inconsistency\" and\nsays that an honest editor should have published\nthe whole artice.'' We would plead guilty to the\ncharge of unfairness, had we, in selecting quo\ntation from Mr.. Harker's opinion Of Gen. Jackson\nin 1922, attempted to misreprcsent his sentiments\nor pervert his language. But this we have not\ndone. We have only given his own words, express\nsed after mature delbcration. We would suppose\nthat the remark of Fair Play respecting the duty\nof an honest editor,' would come home to Mr..\nIIarker, as the latter has said that an honest man\ncannot be shamed by sight of what he has said\non a former OCCASION\" Now, according to Mr..\nHarker's own rule, he is not \" fan honest man''-\nfor he is ashamed to repubish what he said of Gen.\nJackson in 1892 Or, if he is an honest man, he\n\n\nIS co,oardty one, for he is afraid to republsh what\nhe then said of the General, when, in comparing him\nwith Messrs. Clay, Clinton, Adams, Calhoun and\nCrawford, he made use Of the following language.\n\n\n\"Of ALL the gentlemen named Gen jackson appears\nto to be the MOST OBJECTIONABLE. That he is\nman of energy, no one will doubt but we think that\nin chief magistrate of the United States, foe much\nergy Is extremely dangerous; AND have seen IN THE\nGENERAL snch DISREGARD FOR THE INSTITU-\nTIONS of the country, such DISPOSITION place\nhimself ABOVE IT'S iazvs, AND such an INCLINATION 10\nTRAMPLE ON THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS, when\ntbnvc tnod in wiz OWN INTEREST or\nFEELINGS. should render the citizens of the United\nStates very cautious about placing him in the first Office\nwithin their gift\"\n\n\nWe have not given up our intention to republish\nthe whole article from which the above is quoted; !;\nthough we still think that Mr.. Iiarker is under\nevery obligation which could influence gentleman,\nto be the first to present it to the public.\n\n\nHad it been merely a question Of preference\nwith Mr.. Harker, in 1922, between Gen. Jackson\nand any other candidate for the presidency, we\nshould not have charged him with inconsistency,\nor deemed him worthy Of reproach, for now sup\nporting man to whom he was then opposed\n1t is \" the reasons which Mr.. Harkcr gave for\nthat opposition, which lay him open to the charge\nof and hypocrcy, and servlity to his\nmasters, and which are always brought to mind\nwhen we see him pleading with the people to sup\nport man for the high Office of President of the\nUnited States, respecting whom he once said that\nHInc ClllZHUS SUOulu Ue CgTy CuWtoUS duUut pid-\ncling him in the first office within their gift\"\n\n\nNow the question arises, has Gen. Jackson\nchanged his disposition? If in 1929, before that\nperiod. he disregarded the institutions of his coun\ntry If he then placed himself above its laws and\nifhe then trampled the rights of others, to pro-\nmote his own interests, would he not under SINH\nlar circumstances, act as he then did\n\n\nBut in what consisted all these odious traits of\ncharacter which Mr. Harker saw in the General,\n,rd ,,,I,h Iol him IN cautinp he pp0plp auainQf\nsupporting him for the presidency Why, he dis\ncharged his duty with frmness which did HIM\nhonor, and which the emergencies of the times full\nly justified. He gave no quarters to traitors and\ntores-and he declared that if he had been com.\nmander in New England. he would have hung the\nmembers of that infamous band of blue lights who\ncomposed the Hartford Convention. For this de-\nclaration, Mr.. Harker and his correspondents\npoured upon cold Hickory\" such torrents of\nabuse as would have disgraced the veriest black\nguard in creation. After this, we ask any man if\nMr. Harker is not guilty of every charge we have\nmade against him Of inconsistency, &c. in now ad-\nvocating the cause of Gen. Jackson ? Who will\ndeny that he IS led by the nose by few men who, |\nin 1922, thought no better of Gen. Jackson than\nMr.. Harker himself did, and who are now found in\nthe ranks of his supporters only because they flat\nter themselves that their own views will be promo\nted thereby Their golden prospects vanished like\ndream when Mr.. Adams was elected, and their\noppositon to him is the effects of disappointed\nambition. The result of the next presidential\nelection may prove that they again wrong in\ntheir calculations.\n\n\nFor the information of \"Fair Play'' and the\npublic we would state that Albert Wilson, so tar\nfrom being one of the most active individuals in\nwilmington, in causing Book to be opened at\nthe Lafayette Iiotcl,' during the last Presidential\nelection, had nothing to do with procuring the Books",
