It is inferred, however. from this. that the courts of Berlin and Vienna will accede to 1 the protocol of the conference of 4th April All this, taken together. is only calculated to persuade the Porte, the more firmly, that the European powers will not content themselves with mere demonstrations.

The Greeks composing the camp alarmed at the i'll success of the troops of the camp without, sent out in the night two brave Palicari, who passed through the enemy's army to get to the Pieus, in or der to obtain correct information respect ing this unfortunate affair. They found the Greeks very well fortified there, and learnt that Karaiskaki had just gained brilliant victory. Then the troops in the Piras, in concert with the garrison of the Acropolis, attacked the Seraskicr in his camp.\n\n The attack was completely successful the Greeks entirely defeated the Turks, took a great quantity of provision, &c. and returned into tho fortress, which has now a very good stock of provision.\n\n In this sally, the heroine, Madam Gou- \"a, wife of the celebrated General of that name, was killed at the head of her troops, after having shewn herself worthy of the reputation of her husband. Karaiskaki has fixed his camp at Eleusis where he has effected a junction with the old Caratasso, and the patriot Coletti.\n\n Omer Pacha, after having been defeated by karaiskaki, at Distomo. took to flight leaving all his baggage and artillery, which now serves the Greeks. A great number of his men were taken prisoners, who were put to death, to revenge the assassination of Bourback.\n\n The Hellas frigate, commanded by Miaulis, is at Negropont with strong di- vision, to hinder provision from reaching the camp ofSo. askier.

Mr. Stratford Canning has as yet, received no answer to his note of the 5th of 1 Feb. and as the language of the Refs Efendi to that minister, as well as to MT. Ribeau- pierre, leave little hope that the Porte will ac- quiesce in their demands, it is understood that the two ambassadors have agreed to wait un- 1 til certain day, in order to take together some more decisive steps. Count Guillemi- not, the French ambassador, though it does not appear that his court has formally acce- ded to the views of Russia and England re- ! specting Greece, has nevertheless, advised the Refs E6endi to acquiesce in them. March II. The indirect accession of Austria and Prus- sia to the course pursued by the Russian and English ambassadors, was limited, as is be- lleved, to advising, merely, the Refs EHendi to accept the propositions of those two pow CTS. It is inferred, however. from this. that the courts of Berlin and Vienna will accede to 1 the protocol of the conference of 4th April All this, taken together. is only calculated to persuade the Porte, the more firmly, that the European powers will not content themselves with mere demonstrations. Meantime arma- | ments are going on at the arsenals, and the new military organization is proceeding rap idly.

The Greeks composing the camp alarmed at the i'll success of the troops of the camp without, sent out in the night two brave Palicari, who passed through the enemy's army to get to the Pieus, in or der to obtain correct information respect ing this unfortunate affair. They found the Greeks very well fortified there, and learnt that Karaiskaki had just gained brilliant victory. Then the troops in the Piras, in concert with the garrison of the Acropolis, attacked the Seraskicr in his camp.\n\n The attack was completely successful the Greeks entirely defeated the Turks, took a great quantity of provision, &c. and returned into tho fortress, which has now a very good stock of provision.\n\n In this sally, the heroine, Madam Gou- \"a, wife of the celebrated General of that name, was killed at the head of her troops, after having shewn herself worthy of the reputation of her husband. Karaiskaki has fixed his camp at Eleusis where he has effected a junction with the old Caratasso, and the patriot Coletti.\n\n Omer Pacha, after having been defeated by karaiskaki, at Distomo. took to flight leaving all his baggage and artillery, which now serves the Greeks. A great number of his men were taken prisoners, who were put to death, to revenge the assassination of Bourback.\n\n The Hellas frigate, commanded by Miaulis, is at Negropont with strong di- vision, to hinder provision from reaching the camp ofSo. askier. The Government is taking the most energetic measures to drive the Turks from before Aeropolis.- Missolonghi is closely blockadcd by Gen eral Makri i; that place must soon surren- der, being in want of provisions.\n\n Admiral Coehrane and General Church have not yet appeared in these parts.
