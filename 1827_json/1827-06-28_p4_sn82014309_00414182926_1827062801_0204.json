Yorkshire. some piOus persons are in the habit of leaving tracts at the dwellings of the poor. This is done every Sunday mOrn- ing, and the same tract is deposited at each habitatiom. On ohe OccasiOn, the narrative of\" WILLIAM KELLV;\" the frOntispiece of which represents the subject of the story, sneaking hare headed from the presence of a storming hostess, who had seized his hat as security for tavern score. Such circum- stance actually did take place, and proved tine turning point of his life, who was after wards appropriately designated, The happy Christian\" The disgrace of the incident induced sober reflection, sober reflection Is- sued in repentance, and repentance in one of the most pleasing specimens oflowiy piety that modern days can boast.\n\n This tract thus embellished was left among other houses at the house of one of the most proAigate drunkards in the place; and to him strange to say circumstance precisely sim liar to that which arrested Kelly in his career, had occurred the evening before. His hat be- ing detained for debt by the landlady of neighbouring ale house, he ~h had hastened homeward, bare headed, incensed and asham- ed, and had retired to rest raging like she bear robbed of her young. Sunday morning found him sullen and purturbed; he hurried down stairs half dressed, and flung himself ln- to a chair, which stood beside the breakfast table-when To, the first object that caught his attention was the frontispiece 1.-the tract which we have been describing, placed we will not say accidentally, full in his view. Glancing at it, with an eye of fierceness, he seized it, and striking the table with his fist, at the same time uttering fearful impreca- tion, exclaimed, \"Those villanOus Method jsts tiff they hav'nt got me already painted up to be the laughing stock of the whole town; here am without a hat. I'll be even with them.' Thus he raved till the tempest ofhis ire had somewhat exhausted itself in oaths and menaces; ; then prompted by curi- osity, he thought he would ascertain what was said concerning him. A near inspection of the object of his wrath Immediately cor rected his preposterous error but his curios- ty having beeu excited, he peruscd the little. narrative, and the perusal was productive of the happiest effects. He resolved in the strength of God that he would reform, he re- paired to place ofpublic worship, began to search the Scriptures, and exhibited every symptom of real repentance.

Yorkshire. some piOus persons are in the habit of leaving tracts at the dwellings of the poor. This is done every Sunday mOrn- ing, and the same tract is deposited at each habitatiom. On ohe OccasiOn, the narrative of\" WILLIAM KELLV;\" the frOntispiece of which represents the subject of the story, sneaking hare headed from the presence of a storming hostess, who had seized his hat as security for tavern score. Such circum- stance actually did take place, and proved tine turning point of his life, who was after wards appropriately designated, The happy Christian\" The disgrace of the incident induced sober reflection, sober reflection Is- sued in repentance, and repentance in one of the most pleasing specimens oflowiy piety that modern days can boast.\n\n This tract thus embellished was left among other houses at the house of one of the most proAigate drunkards in the place; and to him strange to say circumstance precisely sim liar to that which arrested Kelly in his career, had occurred the evening before. His hat be- ing detained for debt by the landlady of neighbouring ale house, he ~h had hastened homeward, bare headed, incensed and asham- ed, and had retired to rest raging like she bear robbed of her young. Sunday morning found him sullen and purturbed; he hurried down stairs half dressed, and flung himself ln- to a chair, which stood beside the breakfast table-when To, the first object that caught his attention was the frontispiece 1.-the tract which we have been describing, placed we will not say accidentally, full in his view. Glancing at it, with an eye of fierceness, he seized it, and striking the table with his fist, at the same time uttering fearful impreca- tion, exclaimed, \"Those villanOus Method jsts tiff they hav'nt got me already painted up to be the laughing stock of the whole town; here am without a hat. I'll be even with them.' Thus he raved till the tempest ofhis ire had somewhat exhausted itself in oaths and menaces; ; then prompted by curi- osity, he thought he would ascertain what was said concerning him. A near inspection of the object of his wrath Immediately cor rected his preposterous error but his curios- ty having beeu excited, he peruscd the little. narrative, and the perusal was productive of the happiest effects. He resolved in the strength of God that he would reform, he re- paired to place ofpublic worship, began to search the Scriptures, and exhibited every symptom of real repentance. He is now if rightly recollect, in the employ of the gen tleman who related the InGidont, and from being disgrace to society, a curse to his neighbourhood, and scourge to his family, he has become one of the kindest of neigh bours, faithfulest of servants, best of fathers, and soberest of men.-Lond.
