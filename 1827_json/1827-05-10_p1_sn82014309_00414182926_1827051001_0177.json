There is no doubt, we learn, that they came from the same source through which they have been heretofore intoduc- ed into New York and Boston. The spurious or logwood dyed cloths, after be- ing made up and exposed to the air for a short time, become of a claret or dirty rcd color, and exhibit shabby appearance Our informant, in order to show the difference between the genuine and spurious dyes, applied, in our presence, the test of aqua-fortis, to several pieces of cloth of each kind.-The effect na every. instance was, that the indigo remained unchanged, while the haywood dye was destroyed and turned to scarlet hue. These spurious cloths, from the cheapness of the dye, are sold at low rate, but to the consumer they will always prove a dear bargain.\n\n We have in our pocket-book, specimene of the cloths, that were submitted 10 the test above spoken of. The spurious dyes are turned scarlet. All who deal in John Bulls goods ought to carry a small bottle of. 0quG- fortis with them.-It will often bring JOhn out, with his red coat upon him instead of the blue-the true blue\" which he would pass upon us. -NiIes.",

She was reduced so low as to be unable to get from her bed to the fire without aid. All hopes of her recovery had long been given up.

Y April, 1927.\n\n In the spring of 1925, a few bushels of hemp seed were brought into this vicinity, which was sown and planted for the pur- pose of obtaining seed :; the quantity of seed raised the first year was about POO bushels. In the Spring of 1926, the 200 bushels were sown and planted as before, and although both seasons were very unfa- vcrable on account of severe drought, there was raised about 1900 bushels of seed and about g tons of hemp. Hemp seed has sold, this season, generally, for a- bout four dollars per bushel. There will be sown the present season,in this vicinity, six hundred acres-which will probably produce $3O,OOO dollars worth of hemp and seed. It does not require more labour per acre than a crop of wheat. Hemp is dressed 6y c machine ,Oith0ut rotting, and meets soiM e ready sale at market. Last season one and half acres produced S16O worth of hemp and seed, exclusive of the premium for dressing.

When, seen, the body of the animal was raised considerably a. bove the surface of the water; and from the near appearance of that part of it to the human form, was then judged to be a mermaid. 1t was in company with two others, and they were all wading theIr way by means of what the spectators called their arms.

The spurious or logwood dyed cloths, after be- ing made up and exposed to the air for a short time, become of a claret or dirty rcd color, and exhibit shabby appearance Our informant, in order to show the difference between the genuine and spurious dyes, applied, in our presence, the test of aqua-fortis, to several pieces of cloth of each kind.-The effect na every. instance was, that the indigo remained unchanged, while the haywood dye was destroyed and turned to scarlet hue. These spurious cloths, from the cheapness of the dye, are sold at low rate, but to the consumer they will always prove a dear bargain.\n\n We have in our pocket-book, specimene of the cloths, that were submitted 10 the test above spoken of.

Y April, 1927.\n\n In the spring of 1925, a few bushels of hemp seed were brought into this vicinity, which was sown and planted for the pur- pose of obtaining seed :; the quantity of seed raised the first year was about POO bushels. In the Spring of 1926, the 200 bushels were sown and planted as before, and although both seasons were very unfa- vcrable on account of severe drought, there was raised about 1900 bushels of seed and about g tons of hemp. Hemp seed has sold, this season, generally, for a- bout four dollars per bushel. There will be sown the present season,in this vicinity, six hundred acres-which will probably produce $3O,OOO dollars worth of hemp and seed. It does not require more labour per acre than a crop of wheat. Hemp is dressed 6y c machine ,Oith0ut rotting, and meets soiM e ready sale at market. Last season one and half acres produced S16O worth of hemp and seed, exclusive of the premium for dressing. The premium for dressing unrotted hemp is one third.\n\n Nites Reg.\n\n From he Hampshire Eng Telegraph.\n\n Curious E9sh.-The skeleton ofa very curious and rare animal has been landed here, this week, from the Diadem trans- port, which has been viewed by great number of persons, as the remains of Mermaid, but which appears, from MT. Sights description, which we subjoin, to be DugOng. Itwas shot by lieut.. Eme- ry, near the island of Mombass, and died shortly afterwards. When, seen, the body of the animal was raised considerably a. bove the surface of the water; and from the near appearance of that part of it to the human form, was then judged to be a mermaid. 1t was in company with two others, and they were all wading theIr way by means of what the spectators called their arms. Lieut.. Emery ate some ofthe flesh, which he describes as being very sa- voury. He was unable to preserve the shin but the bones are saved entire. It is rather more than five feet long. s' To the printer.-C considerable curiosity hav- ing been excited by anaccount of the land- ing at this port of the skeleton of \"real mermaid\" was induced to examine the subject in question. Ihave no doubt but that il is the bony fabric of an animal cal- led the Dugong, a native ofthe Indian seas, and regarded by many ofthe natives of the different islands as Royal fish; the pee culiar form of the head, more especially the lower jaw, being at once characterize tic mark-and also the form, situation, ,and number of the teeth. There are many other peculiarities, more especially the mode by which the ribs are articulated to the breast bone, and the form of the brcast bone itself, which arc highly interesting to the comparative anatOmist, and which serve",
