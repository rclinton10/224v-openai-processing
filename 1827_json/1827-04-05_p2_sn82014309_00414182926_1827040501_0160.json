'We shall probably go down my friends, '\" said he, \"and we may better remain here, than encounter additional danger above.\" As the smoke cleared away, tho captain called all hands upon deck. Mir. Lockwood gained his feet, amid the wreck by which he was surrounded, and was first discover ed by MT. Washburn, by whom he was supported to the ladies' cabin, out of which it was the will of Providence he should never como alive. His first words were, \"I am dead man-my throat is burning-i shall not recover\" Dr. Spring flew to his assistance, and was un- remitting in his attentions until he expired, which was at o'clock on Saturday after noon. Nor was he remiSs in his atten- tions to the other sufferers.\n\n The scene, as it may well be judged, was no less frightful above, than appalling below. There were but three ladies on board but their guardians instantly put them into the small boat, which hung as usual by the side of the steamer.-Into this boat the passengers to the number of Is or 20, sprang after them, and it was on- ly by the quick and decisive order of the captain, that they were saved from being precipitated into the angry deep by the parting of the rigging, which was beginning to yield to the unusual weight. The suf- ferings of the engineer and fireman, can not be described. Their cries were ago. nizing. Mir. Lockwood did not complain of severe pain, but was ra her benumbed. His hands, and head, and one side, were frightfully scalded. The only medical ar .ticle on board, was sweet oil, which was ' 'copiously administered both externally and internally.\n\n After some degree of order had been restored, and it was ascertained that there was no danger of sinking, the passengers and crew were collected into the cabin, Land fervent address to the throne of infinite grace, was offered by Dr. Spring, suppli- eating mercy and compassion for the wounded, and pouring out a greattul thank offering for the delivcrance of those who had escaped the mediate perils of the try ing moment.

The physician, (Dr. Carter,) hastened to their assistance, with his two students, with cotton for applications, and such medi- cines as the emergency demanded. Great praise is awarded him for his alacrity skill, & tenderness with the sufferers, as also that of his pupils. The fireman however di- ed in a few hours. Before light, the Mac thorough, Capt. Beebe, from this city came along, was hailed, and took the Oliver Ellsworth in tow, to the landing at Say brook, where the disaster had of course be- come generally known, and where the ut- most sympathy was manifested, and the greatest attention shown by the inhabitants.

An air of deep solemnity pre- vailed the whole multitude. The pl ayer was peculiarly affecting and impressive and when Dr. s. rose to pronounce his text, a breathless silence reigned throughout the solemn assemblY.--There was an eagernesS to catch every word. His text was from Isaiah. xxxviii 17, \"Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corrup- tion.\" The discourse was in great meas ure extemporanious, but highly appropri- ate and impressive. At times the speak CT was so nearly overcome with emotion, that his utterance was Choaked.. .. But it was literally an assemblage of mourners, and his sobs and his tears, mingled with those of his hearers-for there appeared not to be dry eye, or an unmoved bosom, in the congregation. But when he dwelt upon the surprising patience, fortitude, and perfect resignation, and the manner of the death of his friend and fellow labourer, gleam of iov passed over his countenance, like a bright ray of sunshine shooting through the mechanically clouds of Autumn. It was a solemn service, and long will it be remem- bered.\n\n We have dwelt longer on the painful subject than we had anticipated. But to the large and respectable congregation in which he was an officer, the blow is se- were one. It is true that the loss of one so suddenly summoned to his long ac- count, is no greater than though he had Ianguished weeks upon the bed ofsickness. But the attention of friends and relatives around the bed of sickness and gradual de- cay, and thousand endearing circumstan- ces contribute to sooth the feelings, while the daily spectacle of wasting nature pre- pares the minds of the surviving friends for the souls departure. The heavier the blow the severer the pang. And when, as in the present case, OUT friends are cut down in the flash of health, in the prime and vigor of manhood, and in the midst of lives of exemplary piety and extensive use- fitness, it is then that the sting of death is often more keenly felt by the survivors than the victim.-N. Y. Spec.\n\n A report having found its way into sey- eral papers, that an arrangement of the difference on the Colonial question with Great Britain had been made by MT. GAL LATIN, we have taken some pains to in- quire into the truth oft. We learn that there is no ground whatever for the re- port; but that on the contrary, Great Brit ain perseveres in altogether refusing to treat on that question. There is, there- fore, no prospect whatever of any adjust ment of it by convention.\n\n It is now more than ever matter of regret, that Congress should have adjour- ned without passing any new law. The bill which was simultaneously reported by the Committee of the two Houses specif- ed the conditions on which this Govern ment was willing to place the trade. !, They were reasonable and moderate, and con- tained the smallest amount of privilege with which this country, with any regard to in- tcrest, could be satisfied. Had that bill passed, it would have substantially mot the the terms of the British act of parliament 1895, and been legislative proposition to the British Government, which could not have been declined without its being man. ifestcd to the whole world that Great Brit ain is unwilling to place the trade with this country on the same footing as she has put it with all other nations. It may be asked, why cannot the same conditions be thrown into the form of Convention ? The answer is because Great Britain a0iU not treat. The Senate, by putting aside the bill of its own Committee, and substi- tuting that of Gen. Smith, and then refu- sing the amendment of the House, which was necessary to give effect to the bill, and called for by the honor and character of this country, has left the question in most embarrassed state. Nothing can be done now until Congress, at the next session, shall supply the defect of legislation at the last. The consequence is that one year, if not more, is lost by the course which the Senate pursued.-Nat' Int.",

The Grand Khan Kublai is said to have possessed hrs thou sand. and Capt. Jenkius, who was at Agra in 16O7, and delivered letter from King James to the Emperor Jehanglr, relates that the Emperor had ''ttcetre thousand ei- ephants, about 5000 with teeth, the rest, females aud young ones.\" The Emperor Akbar. the predecessor of Jehangir, allot- ted two hundred elephants to every tomda or ten thousand of his cavalry.\n\n These huge and powerful animals were trained to the dreadful business of war, and seemed to acquire pleasure in aiding the wishes of their masters. They were cover ed with armor formed of plates of steel joined together by chains, so as especially to defend the trunk, head, and anterior parts of the body. On the backs ot these animals wooden towers filled with archcrs, were secured, who poured down their mis- siles upon the infantry, being almost out Of danger themselves, as the elephants were protected by their dense skins and super added armor, but by their formidable trunks, yielded with death dealing force, against the assa;lants.\n\n Can any thing be conceived more dread full than field of battle covered by scvcr- al hundred thousand combatants armed solely with swords, spears, axes, and mis- sile weapons, while a host of elephants are rushing upon their ranks? At their irresist- ible onset, thousands are dashed to the earth, and trampled under foot--a blow with the trunk sends the stunted .horsemen to the earth-a thrust with the tusks hurls tie terrified steed among his comrades, while the huge beast, urging forward his c. normous weight, strews the ground with horrible carnage.

As fuel he ranks it with the best kind of soft maple. It affords twice as much fuel as the oak and hickory, at the same age, and growing on the same land.\n\n Maple.-H. A. S. Dearborn, Esq. ob- serves in the N. E. Farmer, that there are nine species of maple in North America, two of which are equally productive of, su- gar-the rock or hard maple of New-Eng- land, and the black sugar tree of the west ern states. Dr. Rush states that the maple is not injured by tapping on the contrary, the ofteDer it is tapped the more syrup is obtained from it. He estimates that tree of ordinary size yields in good season form 20 to 30 gallons of sap, from which are made 5 or pounds of sugar. Sap from trees growing on cleared land is rich CT than that produced in the forest. A pound of sugar is sometimes obtained from three gallons ofthe former. Mir. D says the rock maple wood ranks next to hickory as fuel, and the charcoal made from it is in high estimation. The wood is much used by turner's and cabinet makers; the varie- ties called brds-eye and curled are much admired in this country and in Europe. As an ornamental tree, and for shade, the rock maple is surpassed by very few, if any.\n\n The Romans had species of curled maple which they called the peacock's tail, II OIA us EcScLuDlduCCs run tlilS WRS ilAouO the most beautiful tables, some of which were sold for immense sums.

How far this plot or combination has extended, it is impossible, at this day, ex- actly to ascertain; but that it is of extensive ramifications, has been undoubtedly ascertain ed. That the focus of its influence is fixed in Virginia and that its satellites are scattered through the whole southern country, is no longer matter of speculation that John Randolph has suffered himself to be used as the instrument of the faction at Washington, and that Gov. Troup has vowed himself to the same cause, in Georgia, are equal matters of certainty. It is in pursuance of the settled policy of this faction, that Gov. TrOup, since the day that he first came into office, has on every occasion arraye6 himself against the general government of his country, and taken every occasion to bully and insult her author",

Troup IS undoubtedly made Li,C tool of deeper politicians than himself who in conformity to a prOcOncerted scheme, are de- termined to throw the country into ferment, and to build up a name and an empire for themselves, on the ruins of their country. That the object of this party is directly the dissolution Ofthe Union, & consequent civil war m the bosom of our country, the over throw of our free institutions and the setting up of an aristOcratic form of government in their stead, must we think be apparent to eve ry keen sighted iaaividual who attends the signs of the times. The principles of the par ty with which Gov. Troup has associated himself, has ever been arstOcratic, ever been against the rights and privileges of the poor. Look to the usages of Virginia, where the par ty owes its head and origin. and where tte citizen is deprived of all participation in the government, unless he belongs to the patri- clan order, is not stained with the blotch of poverty, and holds a certain amount of pro- pcrty. The undertaking course of the same party in this state tends directly to the same end. Their policy has ever been to abrdge the privileges of the common people, and con- ccntrate all power in the hands of the few. They have frequently declared that the peo- pie were incompetent to self government, too ignorant to understand their rights, and too li- centlous honestly to pursue them.

It is close to the northern side ofthe Nation al road, seven miles east of Uniontown.\n\n It has been rumored for an early period, that Braddock had been shot by his men. More recently it has been stated by one who cannot be mistaken, that in the course of the battle, Braddock ordered the Pro yincial troops to form column. they, however. adheared to the Indian mode of firing severaIly from behind the trees. Braddock, in his vexation, rode up to man by the name of Fawcett, and with his sword1ashly cut him down.

'We shall probably go down my friends, '\" said he, \"and we may better remain here, than encounter additional danger above.\" As the smoke cleared away, tho captain called all hands upon deck. Mir. Lockwood gained his feet, amid the wreck by which he was surrounded, and was first discover ed by MT. Washburn, by whom he was supported to the ladies' cabin, out of which it was the will of Providence he should never como alive. His first words were, \"I am dead man-my throat is burning-i shall not recover\" Dr. Spring flew to his assistance, and was un- remitting in his attentions until he expired, which was at o'clock on Saturday after noon. Nor was he remiSs in his atten- tions to the other sufferers.\n\n The scene, as it may well be judged, was no less frightful above, than appalling below. There were but three ladies on board but their guardians instantly put them into the small boat, which hung as usual by the side of the steamer.-Into this boat the passengers to the number of Is or 20, sprang after them, and it was on- ly by the quick and decisive order of the captain, that they were saved from being precipitated into the angry deep by the parting of the rigging, which was beginning to yield to the unusual weight. The suf- ferings of the engineer and fireman, can not be described. Their cries were ago. nizing. Mir. Lockwood did not complain of severe pain, but was ra her benumbed. His hands, and head, and one side, were frightfully scalded. The only medical ar .ticle on board, was sweet oil, which was ' 'copiously administered both externally and internally.\n\n After some degree of order had been restored, and it was ascertained that there was no danger of sinking, the passengers and crew were collected into the cabin, Land fervent address to the throne of infinite grace, was offered by Dr. Spring, suppli- eating mercy and compassion for the wounded, and pouring out a greattul thank offering for the delivcrance of those who had escaped the mediate perils of the try ing moment. Whot an impressive hour\n\n \n\n must have felt then: And had the stout est intidel been among them, surely he must have been melted, and bow ill awful reverence and submission to Him who holds the ailments in his hands, aud guides them according to His sovreign pleasure\n\n The sails were spread, and the boat re- turned to within four miles of Saybrook landing, where she came to anchor, and ooat was sent on shore, and messengers to the village, to make known the disaster, and procure such relief as could be had. The physician, (Dr. Carter,) hastened to their assistance, with his two students, with cotton for applications, and such medi- cines as the emergency demanded. Great praise is awarded him for his alacrity skill, & tenderness with the sufferers, as also that of his pupils. The fireman however di- ed in a few hours. Before light, the Mac thorough, Capt. Beebe, from this city came along, was hailed, and took the Oliver Ellsworth in tow, to the landing at Say brook, where the disaster had of course be- come generally known, and where the ut- most sympathy was manifested, and the greatest attention shown by the inhabitants. The ladies from the village, Ia mile dis tant,) moreover, sent every thing down which they supposed would contribute to the comfort of the passengers, and mitigate the sulleiings oi :he wounded The cier- gyman of the parish, (Mr. Hctchkiss,) all so attended to mingle with Mir.

An drus, the fireman, was taken on shore, fa- neral service performed, among which MT.

            "article": "Spring rose apparently with an InSupport- able weight upon his heart, and gave no- tice that it was the wish of the passengers who had escaped the dreadful calamity, publicly to return thanks to Almighty God for his protecting care and goodness during the hour of peril, which they had so re- gently escaped, and he should esteem it a privilege to unite with them in such an off, fering, in the service of the afternoon.\n\n This notice brought together great concourse of people in the afternoon, so that the house was crowded to the utmost capacity, from floor to gallery, and in eve- ry aisle. An air of deep solemnity pre- vailed the whole multitude. The pl ayer was peculiarly affecting and impressive and when Dr. s. rose to pronounce his text, a breathless silence reigned throughout the solemn assemblY.--There was an eagernesS to catch every word. His text was from Isaiah. xxxviii 17, \"Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corrup- tion.\" The discourse was in great meas ure extemporanious, but highly appropri- ate and impressive. At times the speak CT was so nearly overcome with emotion, that his utterance was Choaked.. .. But it was literally an assemblage of mourners, and his sobs and his tears, mingled with those of his hearers-for there appeared not to be dry eye, or an unmoved bosom, in the congregation. But when he dwelt upon the surprising patience, fortitude, and perfect resignation, and the manner of the death of his friend and fellow labourer, gleam of iov passed over his countenance, like a bright ray of sunshine shooting through the mechanically clouds of Autumn. It was a solemn service, and long will it be remem- bered.\n\n We have dwelt longer on the painful subject than we had anticipated. But to the large and respectable congregation in which he was an officer, the blow is se- were one. It is true that the loss of one so suddenly summoned to his long ac- count, is no greater than though he had Ianguished weeks upon the bed ofsickness. But the attention of friends and relatives around the bed of sickness and gradual de- cay, and thousand endearing circumstan- ces contribute to sooth the feelings, while the daily spectacle of wasting nature pre- pares the minds of the surviving friends for the souls departure. The heavier the blow the severer the pang. And when, as in the present case, OUT friends are cut down in the flash of health, in the prime and vigor of manhood, and in the midst of lives of exemplary piety and extensive use- fitness, it is then that the sting of death is often more keenly felt by the survivors than the victim.-N. Y. Spec.\n\n A report having found its way into sey- eral papers, that an arrangement of the difference on the Colonial question with Great Britain had been made by MT. GAL LATIN, we have taken some pains to in- quire into the truth oft. We learn that there is no ground whatever for the re- port; but that on the contrary, Great Brit ain perseveres in altogether refusing to treat on that question. There is, there- fore, no prospect whatever of any adjust ment of it by convention.\n\n It is now more than ever matter of regret, that Congress should have adjour- ned without passing any new law. The bill which was simultaneously reported by the Committee of the two Houses specif- ed the conditions on which this Govern ment was willing to place the trade. !, They were reasonable and moderate, and con- tained the smallest amount of privilege with which this country, with any regard to in- tcrest, could be satisfied. Had that bill passed, it would have substantially mot the the terms of the British act of parliament 1895, and been legislative proposition to the British Government, which could not have been declined without its being man. ifestcd to the whole world that Great Brit ain is unwilling to place the trade with this country on the same footing as she has put it with all other nations. It may be asked, why cannot the same conditions be thrown into the form of Convention ? The answer is because Great Britain a0iU not treat. The Senate, by putting aside the bill of its own Committee, and substi- tuting that of Gen. Smith, and then refu- sing the amendment of the House, which was necessary to give effect to the bill, and called for by the honor and character of this country, has left the question in most embarrassed state. Nothing can be done now until Congress, at the next session, shall supply the defect of legislation at the last. The consequence is that one year, if not more, is lost by the course which the Senate pursued.-Nat' Int.",

As fuel he ranks it with the best kind of soft maple. It affords twice as much fuel as the oak and hickory, at the same age, and growing on the same land.\n\n Maple.-H. A. S. Dearborn, Esq. ob- serves in the N. E. Farmer, that there are nine species of maple in North America, two of which are equally productive of, su- gar-the rock or hard maple of New-Eng- land, and the black sugar tree of the west ern states. Dr. Rush states that the maple is not injured by tapping on the contrary, the ofteDer it is tapped the more syrup is obtained from it. He estimates that tree of ordinary size yields in good season form 20 to 30 gallons of sap, from which are made 5 or pounds of sugar. Sap from trees growing on cleared land is rich CT than that produced in the forest. A pound of sugar is sometimes obtained from three gallons ofthe former. Mir. D says the rock maple wood ranks next to hickory as fuel, and the charcoal made from it is in high estimation. The wood is much used by turner's and cabinet makers; the varie- ties called brds-eye and curled are much admired in this country and in Europe. As an ornamental tree, and for shade, the rock maple is surpassed by very few, if any.\n\n The Romans had species of curled maple which they called the peacock's tail, II OIA us EcScLuDlduCCs run tlilS WRS ilAouO the most beautiful tables, some of which were sold for immense sums.

We had barely time on Saturday 10 an- nounce in poscript, in the briefest possi- ble terms,, the melancholy disaster which occurred on board of the steam boat Oliver on Thursday evening, nor could we even then give all the particulars which were communicated to us by the passen- gers.

How far this plot or combination has extended, it is impossible, at this day, ex- actly to ascertain; but that it is of extensive ramifications, has been undoubtedly ascertain ed. That the focus of its influence is fixed in Virginia and that its satellites are scattered through the whole southern country, is no longer matter of speculation that John Randolph has suffered himself to be used as the instrument of the faction at Washington, and that Gov. Troup has vowed himself to the same cause, in Georgia, are equal matters of certainty. It is in pursuance of the settled policy of this faction, that Gov. TrOup, since the day that he first came into office, has on every occasion arraye6 himself against the general government of his country, and taken every occasion to bully and insult her author",
