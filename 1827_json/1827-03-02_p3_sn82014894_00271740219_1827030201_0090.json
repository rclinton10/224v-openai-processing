We\nwish undeceive him in the opinion he has formed Of the\nCorporal.\n\n\nWe have recently published Mr.. Harksr's opin-\nion of Gen. Jackson, expressed by him 10 his\nGazette before the la.t Presidential election. Mr..\nHalker notices our publication, in his paper OF\nTuesday, and in an article under the head Of\n!\" Consistency,\" says, near the commencement\nWe will not say that such an expression was ncv-\ner made By US, for VIC do not know at what time or\nunder what circumstances it is pretended that i,\nwas made !; but we will say that We have no recol-\nlection of having used the language in the manner\nattributed to us; and We will say, moreover, tina,\n| VIC 90 NOT tniDk VIC SsCl uu ~ usG IL a. so\nevents\" Continues he, \"a candid and honorable\nopponent would have pointed to the time when we\nso expressed ourselves\" This we had always in\ntended 10 do But it seems Mr.. Harker has anti\ncpated u.s. for before he gets to the conclusion OF\nhis consistent article, he makes discovery OF the\ntime when he ssed the language which We have\nseveral times quoted as expressive OF his opinion OF\nthe character Of Gen. Jackson. But he attempts\n10 clear himself from the charge Of Inconsistency\nkrz, ht / for lin m an\nonce so grossly and unsparngly abused, BY assert\ning that tine passage which have quoted to prove\n| his inconsistency was only used in comparison\nbetween the General and Messrs. Clay and Clinton,\nand that it does not express the sentiment that he\nconsidered him more Objectionable than Mr.. A\ndams. Mr.. Harker, in making use OF such sub\ntcrfuge only shows the desperate state OF his case.\n\n\nWe have now before us the Delaware Gazette\nOf November 1, 1922, which may be seen at this\nOffice In that paper, MIR. Harker is noticing the\nchange which had Just taken place in the proprle\ntorship Of the Aurora and informs his readers\nthat VIM. J. Duane, who was to edit the paper\nuntil the new proprietor took possession OF it, has\ntaken up the subject Of the approaching Presden\nta Election, and in presenting his views on 1t, has\narrayed Messrs Clay, Clinton and Jackson, against\nMessrs. Adams, Calhoun, and Crawford\" In the\nthird paragraph following, Mr.. Harker says,\n\"of all the gentlemen named. Gen. Jackson appear,\nto us to be the MOST OBJECTIONABLE. That he is\nq man of energy, will doubt, but we think that\nin chief magistrate of the United States, too much en-\nsrey i extremely dangerous; AND have seen IN THE\nGENERAL such DISREGARD FOR THE INSTITU-\nTIONS of the country, such a DISPOSITION 10 place\nhimself ABOVE ts iarvs, AND such an INCLINATION \"a\nTRAMpLE ON THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS, when\nthey stood in competition with HIS OWN INTEREST o.\nFEELINGS, as should render the citizens Of the United\nStates vry cautious about placing him in the first office\nwithin their gift\n\n\nWe would not insul, the good understanding o\nour readers by attempting to give an explanation\nOf Mr.. Harker's meaning in the above language\n1t is too plain to need translator.\n\n\n| But even granting that the extract from the Ga\nzeue Of 1922, was employed in the manner in which\nhe says in his paper Of Tuesday last, it was used\ndoes it at sll affect The language which Mr.. Harker\nemployed in describing tho character OF Gen. Jack.\nson ? By no means. Leaving all comparison with\nother men out Of the question, he has declared\nhim to be man who \" disregards the institutions\nof his country &c. The revival Of these words\nwe know, has produced Mr. Harker great deal oI\nunea asiness, and made him almost wish that his Ga.\nzete had never been filed-and put him into grea.\nouandary as to how to act upon his assertion that\n!. an honest man cannot be shamed BY sight Of\n\n\nwhat HE HAS SAID on former OCCASION\"\nFrom the frequent notices, in the opposition\nprints OF the state OF Mr. CrdfGrds hea we are ied 10\nsuppose that idea is entertained of bringing him\nforward again a candidate for the presidency Savan\nnah paper of the 20l u states that his health is better\nthan has been any period since 1928, that his speech\nnearly or quite restored and that his whole system is\nimproving strength\" Will Corporal IIarker. who pro\n\n\nsses know every thing about such matters. inform\nwhether there is any probability that Gen.
