II should be carried few feet above the\n| top Of the roof, and have lateral openings by\nmeaHs of slantng boards, but closed on the tops\nby which contrivance, there would be free\ncommunication with the atmosphere, and the\nrain would be effectually excluded.\n\n\n| There have been different opinions held with\nrespect to the removal of the litter during the\nday: but when we consider how rapidly and a\nbundant.y ammonia or the volatile akal is gen\nGrated in it, and how injurious that yapour is to\nthe eyes and lungs, there can be no doubt OF the\npropriety of removing it. DR.. Egan OF Dublin\nhas discovered according to Mr.. Peale, that the\nurine of the horse begins to generate volatile\nalkali very soon after It is yolded: and It is well\nobserved, by the same author, that IT this vapour\nbe capable ofpainfully stimulating sound and\nhealthy eye, its effects upon one that IS lntiam-\ned, and consequently, extremely irritable, must\nbe both highly painful and prejudicial to the or\ngan. In confirmation Of this opinion, the author\nrelates the following experiment; A horse la\nbouring under inflammation OF the eye, was Iemoy-\n| ed from the stable, where he Kept ms eyes con\nstanty shut and placed in COO, AIRY situation; IN\nthe space of half an hour he began gradually to\nopen his eyes, and, in the space 1.-TWO or three\nhours, he kept them open boldly. The horse\nwas again placed in the stable, and in few min\nutes he began gradually to close his eyes, and\nafter an hour or two, kept them constantly shut.\nNot satisfied, however, with this experiment,\nthough it seems pretty conclusive, the horse was\nagain removed to the cool situation, and the same\neffect followed rs at first. II the vapours pro\nduced by foul litter prove SO injurious to the\neyes, it cannot surely be less prejudicial to the\nlungs; and it is highly probable !hat if coughs\nare not produced in this way they are often az\ngrayated and rendered incurable by those lil'tat-\ning etiluvia.-Another evil to be considered is\nthe propensity observable in many horses TO cat\ntheir litter This is often the case with such as\nhave chronic cough, or are disposed to become\nbroken wnded, or have worms; and in all these\ndiseases, there is nothing, perhaps moro likely\nto increase them than the animals eating foul\nlitter. l. must be obvious that horses employ\ncd in severe labour should be allowed to, lie\ndown whenever they are inclined 10 do so but\nevent then, all their litter may be turned out car\n~ in the morning, the floor of the stall swept\nperfectly clean, and bed OF fresh straw put in.\n1t the foul litter be spread abroad in the open ar\nand shaken up two or three times during the day,\nthe greater part would be again fit for litter and,\n~\nserve TO replace that upon which the horse has\nrested during the day. It has been said, that\nhorses which stand constantly on litter are apt 10\nfeel the difference Of the rOatl and become ten\nder-footed. Mr. CLARK observes that the heat\narising from the litter occasions a more than or\ndinary derivation Of blood to the legs and fcct,-\nand hence arise swelling or gourdiness Of those\n( parts, greasy heels, and stiffness or nunbness.\n! ifthe horse lies down for relief, the heat of the\nlitter soon forces him to get up again, and after\nrepeatedly lying down, and forced to get up i'm\nmediately from the above cause, he attempts it\nno further; he stands upright, or perhaps little\nstraddllng, often shifting the weight of his body\n| from one leg to the other. This erect position,\n| in which he is obliged to stand, increases the\nswengs in his legs, &c. and recourse is then\nhad to bleeding, purging, diurctics, &c.\n\n\nLord Pembroke, in his Military Equitation, OBJ\n\n\nserves that after working, and at night Of course,\nas also IN lameness and sickness, il is good for\nhorses to stand on litter; it also produces stang\n&c. At other times it is bad custom; the con.\nstant use oft heats and makes the feet tender,\nand causes swe|ed legs moreover, it renders\n| the animal delicate\n\n\n! Swclled legs may be often reduced to their\nnatural size, merely by taking away tile litter,\nwhich, in some stables, where ignorant grooms\nand farrers govern, would be a great saving of\nphysic and bleeding, besides straw\n\n\n| Lord Pembroke noticed by repeated expert\nments, that legs or unswell by leaving litter\nor taking it away, like mercury in weather\nglass. Mr.. Blaine is ofopinion, that the custom\n4 of standing on litter ruins more horses than all\nthe mail and stage coaches put together; that it\nis the fruitful source of contracted feet, and\n\n\nbrings on that r,nnous affection with more Ger\ntainty than the hardest ork In nv own sta\n\n\nbles Che says) no litter is suffered to remain\n\n\nunder the forefcet during the day. The horses\n\n\nstand on bare bricks, which, in summer arc wa\n\n\ntered to make them more cool; by which means\nhave experienced astonishing benefit. iehind\n\n\nlittle litter is sstrewed, because they are apt 10\n\n\nkick and break the bricks with their hind feet;\nand because the litter thus placed sucks up tho\n! moisture Of the Urine, which would be tletrmen-\ntai to the hinder feet which are more liable ia\n\n\nthrushes than contraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n.4necdote.-When Sir Richard Steele was\n: fitting up his great room in York buildings,\nfor public orations, he happened at that time\nto be pretty much behind in the payment oi\n. his workmen, and coming one day among\nthem to see how they went forward, he or.\ndered one OF them to get up into the rostrum\n\n\nand make a speech that he might observe\nr how it could be heard The fellow mount\n: ed, and scratching his pate, told him he knew\n: not what to say, for in truth he was no orator\nc OH said the knight mo matter for that. saw",

            "article": "liz . hDhIi'\n\n\nWhen stable is ventilated by means ofa tube\nor chimney, it should be placed in the centre of\nthe ceiling, the opening in which should be large,\nin proportion to the number of horses kept; 1t\ncannot well be too large, but it may be contract\n| ed upwards, so as to leave concal shape, or 1t\nmay be made so as to resemble a dome cupo-\nla. II should be carried few feet above the\n| top Of the roof, and have lateral openings by\nmeaHs of slantng boards, but closed on the tops\nby which contrivance, there would be free\ncommunication with the atmosphere, and the\nrain would be effectually excluded.\n\n\n| There have been different opinions held with\nrespect to the removal of the litter during the\nday: but when we consider how rapidly and a\nbundant.y ammonia or the volatile akal is gen\nGrated in it, and how injurious that yapour is to\nthe eyes and lungs, there can be no doubt OF the\npropriety of removing it. DR.. Egan OF Dublin\nhas discovered according to Mr.. Peale, that the\nurine of the horse begins to generate volatile\nalkali very soon after It is yolded: and It is well\nobserved, by the same author, that IT this vapour\nbe capable ofpainfully stimulating sound and\nhealthy eye, its effects upon one that IS lntiam-\ned, and consequently, extremely irritable, must\nbe both highly painful and prejudicial to the or\ngan. In confirmation Of this opinion, the author\nrelates the following experiment; A horse la\nbouring under inflammation OF the eye, was Iemoy-\n| ed from the stable, where he Kept ms eyes con\nstanty shut and placed in COO, AIRY situation; IN\nthe space of half an hour he began gradually to\nopen his eyes, and, in the space 1.-TWO or three\nhours, he kept them open boldly. The horse\nwas again placed in the stable, and in few min\nutes he began gradually to close his eyes, and\nafter an hour or two, kept them constantly shut.\nNot satisfied, however, with this experiment,\nthough it seems pretty conclusive, the horse was\nagain removed to the cool situation, and the same\neffect followed rs at first. II the vapours pro\nduced by foul litter prove SO injurious to the\neyes, it cannot surely be less prejudicial to the\nlungs; and it is highly probable !hat if coughs\nare not produced in this way they are often az\ngrayated and rendered incurable by those lil'tat-\ning etiluvia.-Another evil to be considered is\nthe propensity observable in many horses TO cat\ntheir litter This is often the case with such as\nhave chronic cough, or are disposed to become\nbroken wnded, or have worms; and in all these\ndiseases, there is nothing, perhaps moro likely\nto increase them than the animals eating foul\nlitter. l. must be obvious that horses employ\ncd in severe labour should be allowed to, lie\ndown whenever they are inclined 10 do so but\nevent then, all their litter may be turned out car\n~ in the morning, the floor of the stall swept\nperfectly clean, and bed OF fresh straw put in.\n1t the foul litter be spread abroad in the open ar\nand shaken up two or three times during the day,\nthe greater part would be again fit for litter and,\n~\nserve TO replace that upon which the horse has\nrested during the day. It has been said, that\nhorses which stand constantly on litter are apt 10\nfeel the difference Of the rOatl and become ten\nder-footed. Mr. CLARK observes that the heat\narising from the litter occasions a more than or\ndinary derivation Of blood to the legs and fcct,-\nand hence arise swelling or gourdiness Of those\n( parts, greasy heels, and stiffness or nunbness.\n! ifthe horse lies down for relief, the heat of the\nlitter soon forces him to get up again, and after\nrepeatedly lying down, and forced to get up i'm\nmediately from the above cause, he attempts it\nno further; he stands upright, or perhaps little\nstraddllng, often shifting the weight of his body\n| from one leg to the other. This erect position,\n| in which he is obliged to stand, increases the\nswengs in his legs, &c. and recourse is then\nhad to bleeding, purging, diurctics, &c.\n\n\nLord Pembroke, in his Military Equitation, OBJ\n\n\nserves that after working, and at night Of course,\nas also IN lameness and sickness, il is good for\nhorses to stand on litter; it also produces stang\n&c. At other times it is bad custom; the con.\nstant use oft heats and makes the feet tender,\nand causes swe|ed legs moreover, it renders\n| the animal delicate\n\n\n! Swclled legs may be often reduced to their\nnatural size, merely by taking away tile litter,\nwhich, in some stables, where ignorant grooms\nand farrers govern, would be a great saving of\nphysic and bleeding, besides straw\n\n\n| Lord Pembroke noticed by repeated expert\nments, that legs or unswell by leaving litter\nor taking it away, like mercury in weather\nglass. Mr.. Blaine is ofopinion, that the custom\n4 of standing on litter ruins more horses than all\nthe mail and stage coaches put together; that it\nis the fruitful source of contracted feet, and\n\n\nbrings on that r,nnous affection with more Ger\ntainty than the hardest ork In nv own sta\n\n\nbles Che says) no litter is suffered to remain\n\n\nunder the forefcet during the day. The horses\n\n\nstand on bare bricks, which, in summer arc wa\n\n\ntered to make them more cool; by which means\nhave experienced astonishing benefit. iehind\n\n\nlittle litter is sstrewed, because they are apt 10\n\n\nkick and break the bricks with their hind feet;\nand because the litter thus placed sucks up tho\n! moisture Of the Urine, which would be tletrmen-\ntai to the hinder feet which are more liable ia\n\n\nthrushes than contraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n.4necdote.-When Sir Richard Steele was\n: fitting up his great room in York buildings,\nfor public orations, he happened at that time\nto be pretty much behind in the payment oi\n. his workmen, and coming one day among\nthem to see how they went forward, he or.\ndered one OF them to get up into the rostrum\n\n\nand make a speech that he might observe\nr how it could be heard The fellow mount\n: ed, and scratching his pate, told him he knew\n: not what to say, for in truth he was no orator\nc OH said the knight mo matter for that. saw",

In the same years my neigh\nbours generally used the same weapon of\ndefence; but there were few exceptions.\nAnd when the foliage of the apple tree made\nits appearance in the spring of 1910, it was\nfound that those trees which were not tarr-\ned, and those trees which were tarred, wei e\nalike freed from the rayages Of the canker\nworm.\n\n\nThe cause of their sudden exit was attrib-\nuted by some to severe storm which fell\nImmediately after the worms had taken their\nstation on the leaves, and while they were\nextremely small and tender; but whatever\nthe cause might be, this is certain, that we\nhave experienced no great harm from them\nuntil the present year, nor is the damage\ngreat and universal in this vicinity; yet it is\nsufficient to give the alarm and teach us\nthat we must again have recourse to the\nmeans Of an exterminating war, or suffer\nthe consequences which will result from\nsloth and neglect\n\n\nAlthough it may in truth be said that fif-\nteen or sixteen years have elapsed. during\nWHICH time there has been no actual neLes-\nsity for the owners OF orchards standing in\nhostile array against the canker worm; yet\nthe fact is there has not been single year\nsince 1910 but have discovered the enemy\nin my orchard, and he is in some others,\nlurking upon the trees. have also for the\nlast three years discovered gradual in\ncrease of their numbers; but / should have\nsupposed their numbers to have increased\nduring the last year at least four fold.\nrecollect having read, several years since.\nin one of the Boston newspapers, the result\nof an experiment used as preventive a\nganst the canker worm, which was, to the\nbest Of my recollection, in substance as fol-\nlows.\n\n\nA quantity of lime was collected from the\nsweeping OF a lime store, and spread on the\nground around a certain apple tree, some\ntime in the month of November, the foliage\nof which tree had been destroyed BY the can\nker worm the preceding summer, the ground\nat the time being in pulveri2ed state, the\nlime was spread as far from the trunk Of\nthe tree as the droppings from the branches\nextended; the effect was stated 70 be, the\nentire disappearance of the worm, and an in\ncreased vigor of the tree.\n\n\nnow mention this wholly from memory,\nand in the hope that there may be some\none whois acquainted with the fact who will\nhave the goodness to give the details to the\npuDllc.\n\n\nTo use tar as preventive with complete\neffect, my experience teaches me, is a long\nand tedious process, and from which if anv\nother means can be devised equally as eff\ncacious, equally cheap and more expeditions,\nconfess should be glad to have an exemp-\ntion. 1t has been found necessary in some\nyears in the tarring process to commence\nthe operation in the month of November\nand if an orchard be planted on warm soil\nand on southern declivity, the grub has\nbeen found to be on its march every warm\nevening from November, to some time in\nApril, provided they be not impeded by fro\n2cn ground.\n\n\nhave seen great numbers caught in Feb\nruary; and the same year it was necessary\nto tar from that time until the middle oi\nApril, every evening when the state of the\natmosphere was so warm that the grount\ndid not become frozen by sunset. To those\nhowever, who may have occasion to tai\ntheir orchards the year ensuing, and whc\nchoose to travel i'll the old and generally\napproved track, would recommend the ap\nplication of two or three dressings of tar Il\ntheir trees at proper intervals, about the pc\nriod OF the Matching of the worms, or yer,\nsoon after; as experience has discovered\nthat when the female grub is defeated il\nner purpose OF ascending the tree, anc\nthere dcpositing her eggs on the branches\nshe will deposit them within the loose bark\nOF the trunk, and thus perpetuate her proge\nny; and to limited extent defeat the ex\npectations Of those who make use of tar as\npreventive. One other means of prevep\ntion in degree sufficient to preserve th\nfruit from the ravages Of the canker worn,\nwill mention, as there are yet several per\nsons living who will attest the tact.\n\n\nFrom thirty to forty years ago the canke\nworm prevailed very generally in this vi\ncnity, during the whole of those years.\nsome person. tarred their trees, but tn\ngreater part did not at that time one &\nmy neighbors had an orchard which was di\nvided by road 80 feet wide; on one side {\nthe road he planted potatoes every year.\non the other it was generally in grass;-tha\nportion OF his orchard which was plante\nwith potatoes, yielded every other year\nvery handsome supply OF apples (the tree\nbeing all OF one kind under any circumstar\nces never bore every Year, while that po,\nton of his orchard that was in grass WI\nfrom year to year stripped of every gree\nleaf. until at length it became exhausts\nwith its efsrts to produce two generation\nOf leaves year, for so many years in SUI\ncession; the trees became tired of the effo\nand perished.\n\n\nZ",
