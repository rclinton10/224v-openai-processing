Album, on the culture of the Vine\nAS we shall eventually make our own wines\nin this country,-the sooner the better,-we\nhave thought it would be interesting to our\nreaders to learn how profitable this business\nmay be made by those possessing enter\nprise, industry, and the resolution to conquer\ntheir attachment to old habits\n\n\nThe writer commences with remarks on\nthe cultivation Of the vine in France, and\nwith sundry statements exhibiting the an\nnual expense of cultivating an acre of vines\nin various parts of Europe, the quantity OF\nwine produced, and the nett produce per\nacre. He remarks that four acres of vine\nare sufficient in France to occupy one labor\nerr and thinks that an American laborcr\nwill perform twice the quantity that a\nFrench peasant will. An acre of vines netts\nin Provence, $40 IS; Guinenne, 3 IS; the\nLyonnais, 26 73; Nivornois, IS 10; in the\ndifferent departments of Burgundy, from 8\n13 to % so; Sologne 6 27; Seine l8 36;\nChampagne, 6 16 Hevouches Chaptal for\nthe accuracy of these statements.\n\n\n\"Ten acres of the vines i'll France pro-\nduced ninety hogsheads of SO gallons each,\nvalued at 1854 e3; the expense of cutivat\ning those ten acres amounts to $3.50 7e; an\ninterest of ten per centum on those expenses\namounts to S35 81; and the indemnity\nof from eight to ten per cent. for loss of\ncrops amounts to $50 SO, leaving nett prof\nit on the 10 acres, OF Sl38 ID, or 13 81 for\neach acre.\n\n\nA small compensation, though double the\nnett profit of an acre of corn or wheat in the\nUnited States in ordinary times. In France\nthe acre of vine is considered more pro-\nductive than an acre of wheat.\n\n\nYhe article closes with the following Just\nviews of the profits of Vineyard, conduct\ned with skill and industry. One thing we\nmay observe that the culture of the vine\npromises as great prosperity III Pennsy ylvania\nas in Virginia.\n\n\n1t appears to us, no sugar or cotton plan,\ntc.tion, in their best and most hourishing pc\nriods; no species of agriculture, in the best\nsoils, or horticulture in rich gardens in the\nvicinity of large city markets. ever produced\nIuch profits as the vine would yield for a CEN\nfury to come if properly cultivated in the U,\nStates.\n\n\nThe heavy impost on foreign wines, oper-\nates not only as a protecting duty, but as a\nprodigious bounty.\n\n\nIf young proprietor, who has just come\n60 his estate, in that beautiful section of our\ncountry. would set seriously to work in\nplanting the vine, before he arrives at the\nmiddle age of man, he would inevitably be-\ncome the richest planter in the state.\n\n\nOf the old planter, we cannot expec,\nmuch reformation, for\n\n\n\"Habits are stubborn things;\n\n\nAnd when man is turned of forty,\n\n\nThe ruling PASSIONS grown SO naughty,\n\n\nThere's no clipping of its wings\n\n\nHe offers very satisfactory statement o\nthe cost of vineyard of ten acres, making\n1t amount on the fifth year of its culture\nIthe epoch of its full bearing) to 2,o25 dol\nlars. Then follows a statement of gros\nproduce-annual advances for cultivation\nand nett products Of an American Vineyard\nOf ten acres.\n\n\nThis, it must be remembered, is not\nmere creature of pen, ink, and paper but il\nsubstantially that made by Mr..

He remarks that four acres of vine\nare sufficient in France to occupy one labor\nerr and thinks that an American laborcr\nwill perform twice the quantity that a\nFrench peasant will. An acre of vines netts\nin Provence, $40 IS; Guinenne, 3 IS; the\nLyonnais, 26 73; Nivornois, IS 10; in the\ndifferent departments of Burgundy, from 8\n13 to % so; Sologne 6 27; Seine l8 36;\nChampagne, 6 16 Hevouches Chaptal for\nthe accuracy of these statements.\n\n\n\"Ten acres of the vines i'll France pro-\nduced ninety hogsheads of SO gallons each,\nvalued at 1854 e3; the expense of cutivat\ning those ten acres amounts to $3.50 7e; an\ninterest of ten per centum on those expenses\namounts to S35 81; and the indemnity\nof from eight to ten per cent. for loss of\ncrops amounts to $50 SO, leaving nett prof\nit on the 10 acres, OF Sl38 ID, or 13 81 for\neach acre.\n\n\nA small compensation, though double the\nnett profit of an acre of corn or wheat in the\nUnited States in ordinary times. In France\nthe acre of vine is considered more pro-\nductive than an acre of wheat.\n\n\nYhe article closes with the following Just\nviews of the profits of Vineyard, conduct\ned with skill and industry. One thing we\nmay observe that the culture of the vine\npromises as great prosperity III Pennsy ylvania\nas in Virginia.\n\n\n1t appears to us, no sugar or cotton plan,\ntc.tion, in their best and most hourishing pc\nriods; no species of agriculture, in the best\nsoils, or horticulture in rich gardens in the\nvicinity of large city markets. ever produced\nIuch profits as the vine would yield for a CEN\nfury to come if properly cultivated in the U,\nStates.\n\n\nThe heavy impost on foreign wines, oper-\nates not only as a protecting duty, but as a\nprodigious bounty.\n\n\nIf young proprietor, who has just come\n60 his estate, in that beautiful section of our\ncountry. would set seriously to work in\nplanting the vine, before he arrives at the\nmiddle age of man, he would inevitably be-\ncome the richest planter in the state.\n\n\nOf the old planter, we cannot expec,\nmuch reformation, for\n\n\n\"Habits are stubborn things;\n\n\nAnd when man is turned of forty,\n\n\nThe ruling PASSIONS grown SO naughty,\n\n\nThere's no clipping of its wings\n\n\nHe offers very satisfactory statement o\nthe cost of vineyard of ten acres, making\n1t amount on the fifth year of its culture\nIthe epoch of its full bearing) to 2,o25 dol\nlars.

What an unfortunate business for you!-A\nYou say the third class was managed by Patrick\nHiggins-the following will say to the contrary;\n\n\nStatement of Patrick Higgins.\n\n\n81 shall state, as one Of the four managers OF\nthe Lottery, sold by William Larkin, principal\nmanager and treasurer, who received the pro-\nceeds of the four classes of the Delaware Lotte-\nnv, intended by the Legislature of this State for\nthe use and benefit of st.

He\ngave me the tickets, and some time after he\ncame to me, with Arthur Murphy, and said he\nwould not sign the tickets unless Murphy and\nwould give him a bill of indemnity, that in case\nof loss in the third class we should suffer like.\nAS\nLottery schemes than an old woman, we signed\nthe bond. | now inform the public, that Will\nliam Larkin, sometime after this, pursuadcd poor\nMurphy to Join with him and N.
