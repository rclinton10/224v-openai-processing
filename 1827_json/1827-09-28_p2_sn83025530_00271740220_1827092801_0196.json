This\nover-heated and misguided zeal produced, as might\n\n\nhave been looked for, reaction in public sentiment,\n\n\nwhich seemed likely to prove fatal to the cause Of\nGen Jackson. throughout the second congressional\n\n\ndistrict.

Jack\n\n\nton. 1t was stated in Knoxville, during the late\n\n\ncanvass, that man would not be supported Tor the\n\n\ncor,sfabies place, who would not thus act. This\nover-heated and misguided zeal produced, as might\n\n\nhave been looked for, reaction in public sentiment,\n\n\nwhich seemed likely to prove fatal to the cause Of\nGen Jackson. throughout the second congressional\n\n\ndistrict.
