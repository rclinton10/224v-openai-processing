Domestics left in the charge of their masters houses, burst open the cellars and cabinets, and used the treas. are as their own. The richest garments were seen worn by common beggars; the most costIv wines intoxicated the lowest of the pop ulaticn. All safe people fed the city at every hazard, or shut themselves up, and refused to communicate with each other, and scarcity of food--in the very excess of valuabies and money--began to aggravate the general dis tress.-Those physicians who stlll hVed, now made off, with one consent, to secure what they had gained. The monks barred the gates of their convents; some would say no mass and scarce any would confess the sick any longer. Some men lay dead, or dying, in their houses, and none would come to aid or bury them. Others were found with marks of violence upon their bodies, and their cham bers rifed: and none could say, nor did any inquire, who had done 1t. The hired nurses, it was reported, poisoned their patients-and one beldam confessed afterwards, to having caused the death of five women, by adminis- tering the eaw forte, (aqua-fOrtis) to them in stead of common water. Brute strength and freedom from she plague, became the only sources of power; and the slave spat in the face of his master. Those few who still dwelt in the city, or near it, watched armed, aud shut their doors by day, for murders were done even in broad light. The cemeteries now became choked, and there was more room in the streets and market places. Hou- ses got cheap, and graves were hard to come by. The great josse which had been hastily opened, and consecrated at the back of the Spedale, St. Martino, ran over with bodies, from all ranks, ages, and conditions, which. night after night, were cast promiscuously in to it. And, to quote the words used by a writer of the time, in describing the state of Florence at the close of the malady---amost for fault of matter to feed upon-----'' Worth was useless strength gone--glory sulIied---- title was buried---honors were forgotten- greatness humliated---dignity scorned--and, of the good. and of the evil, equally perishcd the memory!''",

The fear of imme- ate danger being taken away, all those fee- lings of freedom of thought, inquiry, & ex-\n\n presson of opinion, for which the struggle commenced, found no constraint or con trol. Each man thought as he pleased, spoke as he pleased, and did as he pleased; if he did not break through the decisions and common laws of the social compact. The South and the North were only known to each other by trifing coasting trade, and the casual intercourse of the members of the General Congress, and the officers of the army during the war. Their man. ners and habits were different they saw objects through various mediums, and drew different conclusions from the same prem ises.~ The French revolution, which soon followed, was new subject ofparty. Ma ny of the people who had suffered by our revolution, and were still suffering from the consequence of it, could not divest themselves of the dislike they felt for Eng land. And when the French nation dis covered, by their proceedings, that they had caught some notions of freedom in their participation in our struggles, they were hailed by portion of our people as men broken from the chains of a thousand years. and just commencing course of glory and happiness. But the events of the French 1 revolution produced different feeling in 1 another portion of our citizens. They | saw in the dreadful scenes then exhibiting in France, no hopes of settled and rational liberty; nothing but anarchy, bloodshed, and, in the sequel, settled tyranny, were present to their minds. These differences served to put still further asunder the two parties into which our country was divided, and to embitter the feelings which by both sides were expressed with too much as- perity. Each side was sincere yet so much suspicion, doubt, and excitement, produce dissensions, criminations, and op- position, which marred the happiness of domestic life, by separating family con- nexions embittered the intercourse of social circles, retarded the progress of in- tellectual requirement., and impaired the physical and moral energies of the nation. Still there was time anticipated when the l great interests of the nation would be a l paramount principle in the bosom of every friend to his country.\n\n The war of 1872 was supposed by many would throw us back nearly half a century; and did, for season, show alarming prog nostics but in the end it was of most es- sential service, in bringing about unanim- ity among the people. Some thought the war was unnecessary, until we were bet ter prepared for it; but it worked it's way with unforeseen power to our good. Those who had been opposed to navy, from the commencement of our national existence. were forced to acknowledge it's efficiency in raising our national character not only in our own estimation, but in that of the whole world. It had in it, as the great projectors of our navy always said it had the seeds of national glory.

This war taught us how necessary it was, in peace to be pre- pared for sC0r; swept away the host of ignorant pretenders to military skill, and left a disposition to fortify our weak posts, to bring science into military tactics and taught US how to economize in the great preparations for defence j; and, above all, it convinced the timid that it was folly to despair of the Commonwealth; and the forward and naughty, that victories were not to be won without great preparations. It brought also industry and ingenuity into action: and while 1t gave confidence to every one, left this lesson for our adver- saries-that the land of our birth and our homes was not to be profaned by hos- tile foot. At the close of this war, we were neither exhausted nor faint-the country soon began to flourish. Agriculture had been advanced, and manufactures began to be established in many parts of our land, and new objects of industry and enterprise were sought out and pursued with success.\n\n \n\n improvement schools were increasing, science and letters were refining the taste of the people, and the numerous comforts and enjoyments of life which flow only from free institutions, were thickening, upon us in the spirit of good fellowship, All was business no repining was heard, all supposed the bitter day was passed general congratulations that the din and strife of party politics had ceased, were the common salute of acquaintance as they met, and friends as they parted. Social improvement was going on with astonish- ing rapidity; old grudges had given way; and men found themselves together who had been seperated for years by political associations and opposite course. The sea-beard and the interior lost their jea1- ousies of each other, and there was no longer separate interest among them 1; but the struggle between them was, who could do the most to benefit the state. The patriot was looking forward to the time when he should no longer fear for the quiet prosperity of his country, and the philanthropist and the Christian fondly hoped that wars and fghtings had ceased 1; and, if the sharp sighted politician did not go quite so far, and had a few suspi- clans about him, yet, he candidly confess sed he could see no reason to forebode a return of party strife, for he could not im- agine of any cause of dissension which could exist at present, or even within the life of the present generation; and if he did not join in all the visions of his more sanguine neighbours, it was from refecting on the history of man-that this happiness was not his lot in this world. The signs of the times were such, that the question was often put, What can come to disturb this delightful harmony? Can men, said the lovers of peace, go back to party dis cord, and destroy for no good purpose, ,ha Ii the happiness of existance2 These impress sions were not confined to our people; for on the Canada frontiers, and even among the officers of the British army, noth- ing is more common than the declaration, ''there never can be another war between the two countries And the people of the United States will be too wise ever to be at variance among themselves upon the great question of their true interest\n\n The last President had been chosen with unanimity. His time was about expiring for the second term in office; and, according to usage he could not serve again. Some one was to be selected to supply his place. It was expected there YVES good share of Honesty at the bottom and this, although not directly acknowledged, was always felt by each party; and out of the arena of politics, some of the warmest disputants were not wanting in friendship to each oth- CT.

An geja, Villa Flor, and Mello, were united, and carried on most effective operations. The Rebels were flying for Galicia. John D. Lacerda had performed much service in the two Beiras and Gen.

London county, as the votes of many towns strongly evince; but the votes do not show that the freemen were anxious for the success of the 1 other District candidates. It is true MT. Ster- ling gets comparatively no support ;-from 0 to 50 is as high as he stands on any list; but MT. Merwin's support was not large, although sufficiently so to give him three votes to one over his opponent. A little more concert of action, little more liberality of feeling. lit- tie less ofthe dictatorial spirit, and the District Ticket would have gone in triumphantly.-| As far as we can learn, every county in the state, with the exception of Fairfield, gave a large majority for the District candidates of their own county; but they appear to have felt but little disposition to help their neigh bours, and by that means their own labour is likely to he lost. Our brother Barber, appa- rently full ofzeal for the overthrow of Legis- lative caucusses, undertook to dictate how far ~\"-~ ''OAN OA EOS 0uu WnCTe it should stop. He wished that MT. Smith, MT. Wildman, and MT. Boardman, might be elected; but he was also willing to place MT. Sterling's name on his District Ticket, noting with star that MT. Merwin was also thought of as candidate in Litchfeld county. Some other candidates nominated in county meet 'ngs were excluded from his list, because it twas not Lest to carry the business too far,\" else the work of reformation might be too complete. The republicans of Litchfeld county did not feel so. If the caucus had done an act of injustice to them, and if their breth- ren in other counties made the same com pIaint' they were not disposed to show any marked civility to his Majesty, but turn out en n'asse and put him down; and had the az grieved party in other counties done the same, there would have been no cause of complaint that candidates have been forced upon the different counties, who were not men of their choice. This election pleads strongly in favor of Districting; and such we understand is the character of d large majority of the represen-",

Domestics left in the charge of their masters houses, burst open the cellars and cabinets, and used the treas. are as their own. The richest garments were seen worn by common beggars; the most costIv wines intoxicated the lowest of the pop ulaticn. All safe people fed the city at every hazard, or shut themselves up, and refused to communicate with each other, and scarcity of food--in the very excess of valuabies and money--began to aggravate the general dis tress.-Those physicians who stlll hVed, now made off, with one consent, to secure what they had gained. The monks barred the gates of their convents; some would say no mass and scarce any would confess the sick any longer. Some men lay dead, or dying, in their houses, and none would come to aid or bury them. Others were found with marks of violence upon their bodies, and their cham bers rifed: and none could say, nor did any inquire, who had done 1t. The hired nurses, it was reported, poisoned their patients-and one beldam confessed afterwards, to having caused the death of five women, by adminis- tering the eaw forte, (aqua-fOrtis) to them in stead of common water. Brute strength and freedom from she plague, became the only sources of power; and the slave spat in the face of his master. Those few who still dwelt in the city, or near it, watched armed, aud shut their doors by day, for murders were done even in broad light. The cemeteries now became choked, and there was more room in the streets and market places. Hou- ses got cheap, and graves were hard to come by. The great josse which had been hastily opened, and consecrated at the back of the Spedale, St. Martino, ran over with bodies, from all ranks, ages, and conditions, which. night after night, were cast promiscuously in to it. And, to quote the words used by a writer of the time, in describing the state of Florence at the close of the malady---amost for fault of matter to feed upon-----'' Worth was useless strength gone--glory sulIied---- title was buried---honors were forgotten- greatness humliated---dignity scorned--and, of the good. and of the evil, equally perishcd the memory!''",

The fear of imme- ate danger being taken away, all those fee- lings of freedom of thought, inquiry, & ex-\n\n presson of opinion, for which the struggle commenced, found no constraint or con trol. Each man thought as he pleased, spoke as he pleased, and did as he pleased; if he did not break through the decisions and common laws of the social compact. The South and the North were only known to each other by trifing coasting trade, and the casual intercourse of the members of the General Congress, and the officers of the army during the war. Their man. ners and habits were different they saw objects through various mediums, and drew different conclusions from the same prem ises.~ The French revolution, which soon followed, was new subject ofparty. Ma ny of the people who had suffered by our revolution, and were still suffering from the consequence of it, could not divest themselves of the dislike they felt for Eng land. And when the French nation dis covered, by their proceedings, that they had caught some notions of freedom in their participation in our struggles, they were hailed by portion of our people as men broken from the chains of a thousand years. and just commencing course of glory and happiness. But the events of the French 1 revolution produced different feeling in 1 another portion of our citizens. They | saw in the dreadful scenes then exhibiting in France, no hopes of settled and rational liberty; nothing but anarchy, bloodshed, and, in the sequel, settled tyranny, were present to their minds. These differences served to put still further asunder the two parties into which our country was divided, and to embitter the feelings which by both sides were expressed with too much as- perity. Each side was sincere yet so much suspicion, doubt, and excitement, produce dissensions, criminations, and op- position, which marred the happiness of domestic life, by separating family con- nexions embittered the intercourse of social circles, retarded the progress of in- tellectual requirement., and impaired the physical and moral energies of the nation.

Some thought the war was unnecessary, until we were bet ter prepared for it; but it worked it's way with unforeseen power to our good. Those who had been opposed to navy, from the commencement of our national existence. were forced to acknowledge it's efficiency in raising our national character not only in our own estimation, but in that of the whole world. It had in it, as the great projectors of our navy always said it had the seeds of national glory.

            "article": "ges of peace could not have produced.\n\n Those who doubted our success in the field, notwithstanding all our disasters, found skill and science in some, and brave- ry in all our land force. This war taught us how necessary it was, in peace to be pre- pared for sC0r; swept away the host of ignorant pretenders to military skill, and left a disposition to fortify our weak posts, to bring science into military tactics and taught US how to economize in the great preparations for defence j; and, above all, it convinced the timid that it was folly to despair of the Commonwealth; and the forward and naughty, that victories were not to be won without great preparations. It brought also industry and ingenuity into action: and while 1t gave confidence to every one, left this lesson for our adver- saries-that the land of our birth and our homes was not to be profaned by hos- tile foot. At the close of this war, we were neither exhausted nor faint-the country soon began to flourish. Agriculture had been advanced, and manufactures began to be established in many parts of our land, and new objects of industry and enterprise were sought out and pursued with success.\n\n \n\n improvement schools were increasing, science and letters were refining the taste of the people, and the numerous comforts and enjoyments of life which flow only from free institutions, were thickening, upon us in the spirit of good fellowship, All was business no repining was heard, all supposed the bitter day was passed general congratulations that the din and strife of party politics had ceased, were the common salute of acquaintance as they met, and friends as they parted. Social improvement was going on with astonish- ing rapidity; old grudges had given way; and men found themselves together who had been seperated for years by political associations and opposite course. The sea-beard and the interior lost their jea1- ousies of each other, and there was no longer separate interest among them 1; but the struggle between them was, who could do the most to benefit the state. The patriot was looking forward to the time when he should no longer fear for the quiet prosperity of his country, and the philanthropist and the Christian fondly hoped that wars and fghtings had ceased 1; and, if the sharp sighted politician did not go quite so far, and had a few suspi- clans about him, yet, he candidly confess sed he could see no reason to forebode a return of party strife, for he could not im- agine of any cause of dissension which could exist at present, or even within the life of the present generation; and if he did not join in all the visions of his more sanguine neighbours, it was from refecting on the history of man-that this happiness was not his lot in this world. The signs of the times were such, that the question was often put, What can come to disturb this delightful harmony? Can men, said the lovers of peace, go back to party dis cord, and destroy for no good purpose, ,ha Ii the happiness of existance2 These impress sions were not confined to our people; for on the Canada frontiers, and even among the officers of the British army, noth- ing is more common than the declaration, ''there never can be another war between the two countries And the people of the United States will be too wise ever to be at variance among themselves upon the great question of their true interest\n\n The last President had been chosen with unanimity. His time was about expiring for the second term in office; and, according to usage he could not serve again. Some one was to be selected to supply his place. It was expected there YVES good share of Honesty at the bottom and this, although not directly acknowledged, was always felt by each party; and out of the arena of politics, some of the warmest disputants were not wanting in friendship to each oth- CT. Other nations saw our party spirit, and, with the smiling derision, pronounced the dark augery of our destinies and often ,syea, sometimes spoke aloud-( This is the last experiment of republi- can government this is the test of it's practibility and you see what it is coming too. The country, however, pros- pered notwithstanding all these unfortu- nate disagreements and party feuds; and the day, not far distant, was anticipated, when there would be some small differ ence of opinion, but not such as would ex- cite more than short-lived hustle.\n\n The most prominent candidate had made no stir-he had looked quietly on without stretching forth his hand to gain vote. He threw the chance of his election upon the good sense of the people. His com mandinp talents were known to than, . h;S",

The nature of the illness was said to be a paralytic stroke. Great sensation was caused in the money market, as his Lord ship was considered the link which holds the present administration together.--- The funds have fallen more than one per cent.\n\n LONDON, Feb. IT. :. We have been favored with the follow ing, the latest intelligence in town, from Portugal. A letter written immediately before the departure ofthe steamboat from Lisbon, dated the Eth Feb. states, e'An express has just now arrived from General Stubbs, at Oporto; the rebels are defeat ed, they have lost their baggage, and are flying in all directions. The reports are. that it is last effort, and that the num- bers did not exceed fifteen hundred men.'' A Parliamentary account of the income and expenditure has just been presented, by which it appears that the income is a. bout 955 100000, and the expenditure IS about G54,OO0,OOO. The surplus, or sinking fund, therefore, is about G1 ,OO0,- 900.\n\n Ar. Cdnning.-There is no denying that this gentleman has not only been se- verely but also dangerously indisposed :- but it is consolatory to add that the danger is passed, and that the Right Hon. Secre- tary is regaining his health. MT. Canning's lndisposition was violent rheumatic affec- ton in the head, brought on whilst atten- ding at the funeral of the late Duke of York, in St. Georges chapel. It was Mir Canning who recommended the Lord Chancellor to guard against cold, by pla- cling his hat under his feet. The Army estimates for the present year have been printed. They amount to the sum of G6, ,6O1 ,847, los. lid. being, within few pounds, the same as they were last year.\n\n The following extracts from two private letters handed to us, contain the latest in- ! telligence from Portugal, of the movements of the Insurgents, and the operations of the Constitutional troops :-\n\n \" Lisbon, Feb. 7, (11 o'clock. )-The Marquis of Angela was at Brega on the Sd, and on the following day was to attack the Marquis de Chaves, who was flying before him, by the bridge of Prado. An geja, Villa Flor, and Mello, were united, and carried on most effective operations. The Rebels were flying for Galicia. John D. Lacerda had performed much service in the two Beiras and Gen. Stubbs de- serves much praise. Gen. Mello com manded the infantry, and Villa Flor the cavalry.\n\n \"I hand you this bulletin, which is to be published this evening the rebels are retreating, and Spain must now disarm them. =\n\n Another private letter of the 7th, states, that part of our English troops had arrived at Coimbra, and the Staff was to leave Lisbon in a day or two. It also says that the rebels were flying again into Spain, being pursued by the Constitution alists.\n\n LONDON, Monday evening\" Feb. 19. Globe Office, half past 4 o'clock. Reported deoth of I7is Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland. It is reported at the House of Lords, within this half hour, that despatches have reached town, bringing information of the deccase of His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, who has been some time suffering from an infammatory attack.- This intelligence cannot be communicated as positive: but we fear, from the man. ner in which it is circulated, that it is cor rect.\n\n Up to this time Lord Liverpool has been going on we'll, but there is not the slightest ground for supposing that he can ever again return into public business. London, Feb. IS.\n\n Portugal.---We yesterday received in telligence from Portugal. The British Army, under the command of Gen. Clin- ton, had marched from Lisbon for Coim- bra, which was to be their headquarters, and where they were to arrive on the 10th.

            "article": "as would show the comparative standing of the different candidates but we are totally unable to collect any thing like list from the different papers in the state. Scarcely any one of them goes further than simply to state the votes ;n their own town.-It is, however, very evident that MT. Tomlinson will be elec- ted and it is said by one or two editors who appear to have had access to the returns from about one hundred towns, that Messrs. Smith, Wildu1an, and Brockway, District candidates for the Senate, and Messrs. Barber and Mer- win. for Congress, will be elected: we confi- dently trust that the work of reformation has gone further than this if it has not, the fault is owing to the supineness rather than the weakness of the reformation party. The friends of the Caucus Ticket rallied their ut most strength, while the friends of the Dis trict Ticket, fearing that nothing could be done, appear to have kept away from the polls ] that nothing might be done. As far as we can learn, Litchfeld county is the only county in the State which has done its duty. Large towns, containing from to 700 hundred free men, gave from 50 to 100 votes. The result of the election, however, has shown what can be done if the freemen are awake to their du- ty; and we also believe it has given death- blow to King Caucus. and released the state from any further allegiance to his Majesty There was want of concert among the friends of Districting, which has very materially in- jured their cause. We believed that MT. Mer- win and MT. Boardman were the choice of Ltchfeld county; and the result has proved that we were not deceived. Each of the two candidates received about 1000 majority in the vicinity where they and their competitors were best known. In asking the support of the friends of Districting in other counties for the District candidates ofthis county, the re- publicans here were willing to be consistent they were as willing. to support the District candidates of other counties, as they were to support like candidates of their own counties, mot so in New-Haven. Mr. Smith was their choice, and they gave him handsome sup\n\n \n\n port to the District candidates of other coun- ties. MT. Barber was the choice of N. London county, as the votes of many towns strongly evince; but the votes do not show that the freemen were anxious for the success of the 1 other District candidates. It is true MT. Ster- ling gets comparatively no support ;-from 0 to 50 is as high as he stands on any list; but MT. Merwin's support was not large, although sufficiently so to give him three votes to one over his opponent. A little more concert of action, little more liberality of feeling. lit- tie less ofthe dictatorial spirit, and the District Ticket would have gone in triumphantly.-| As far as we can learn, every county in the state, with the exception of Fairfield, gave a large majority for the District candidates of their own county; but they appear to have felt but little disposition to help their neigh bours, and by that means their own labour is likely to he lost. Our brother Barber, appa- rently full ofzeal for the overthrow of Legis- lative caucusses, undertook to dictate how far ~\"-~ ''OAN OA EOS 0uu WnCTe it should stop. He wished that MT. Smith, MT. Wildman, and MT. Boardman, might be elected; but he was also willing to place MT. Sterling's name on his District Ticket, noting with star that MT. Merwin was also thought of as candidate in Litchfeld county. Some other candidates nominated in county meet 'ngs were excluded from his list, because it twas not Lest to carry the business too far,\" else the work of reformation might be too complete. The republicans of Litchfeld county did not feel so. If the caucus had done an act of injustice to them, and if their breth- ren in other counties made the same com pIaint' they were not disposed to show any marked civility to his Majesty, but turn out en n'asse and put him down; and had the az grieved party in other counties done the same, there would have been no cause of complaint that candidates have been forced upon the different counties, who were not men of their choice. This election pleads strongly in favor of Districting; and such we understand is the character of d large majority of the represen-",
