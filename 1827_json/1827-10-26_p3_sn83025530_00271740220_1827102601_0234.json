The bodness s. air Of certainty with whicl\nthe assertion was made at first impressed us with\npartial belief Of its truth but, after much observa\nton, the unwelcome nature of the news; or th\ndulness of our perception, has prevented our com\n\n\ning fully to the understanding that such is the fact\nin its full sense The American first prOclaims thu\nnews-the Argus does not deny it; and the Rich\nmond Enquirer says he knew it six weeks ago Or\nthe back of this the Evening Post says: '.We arr\nindeed aware that the scurril0us columns of an Ad\nans paper proclaimed in broad terms the slander\nthat coalition had been entered into between Mr..\nClinton and Mr..

            "article": "October Ia, 1927.\n\n\ns am happy to see recoil Of public opinion in\nfavor of the Administration. For some time after\nthe last Presidential election, many honest well\nmeaning men were carried TO the side Of the yMilia-\ngu Chefiain, by the popular cry of bargain, sale,\nbribery, corruption, intrigue\" &c. &c. and confess\nthat myself labored for short time under the same\ndeIuson and, indeed, strange it was to me, when,\non mature reflection, | took deliberate view of\npast events.\n\n\nThe recent publication of the letters on that\nsubject, and particularly Mr.. Buchanan's, of Penn\nsylvana, has operated on the public mind in my\nneighborhood, the sun does when he rises to dis\nperse the shades of night.\n\n\nIn the recent development alluded to, Clay\nhas gained triumph over his enemies, (or ra-\nthcr they have put themselyes) completely to\nshame rejoice in his triumph and hope every\nman OF correct principles may come out equally\npure, and pass through the ordeal of public cen\nsure with equal credit. have gone to a grea-\nter length on this subject than intended. but could\nsay much more. 1t is subject that think all i'm\nporant at this time to the American People.

True--nolhing is said about Delaware\npapers men but the application to them, in part\nthese remarks, will be easy, and follow almost ir-\nresstably.\n\n\nThat this support should be headed and recon-\nmended by his former adyersares-by men who\nfelt pretended TO feel the utmost horror at the\nmere possibility of his success-that his success\nwould endanger liberty and the republic itself, is\nphenomenon, which as 1t cannot be explained upon\nprinciples creditable to the human character, we\nshall leave altogether uninterrupted. fes--these\nmen not only opposed Gen. jackson, but they were\nthe first 10 do it-they not only the first but\nthey carried their enmity to the most violent ex-\ntreme--they exposed his MANY military vioences---\nIlls contempt of orders his ihractons of the consti-\ntulion-ls disregard OF the rights of persons-his\ndespotlc resort to court martals to ails and to the\nOffice of the hangman, whenever his wishes were OBJ\nstructed, or his imperial temper provoked. Reas-\nonns upon these exhibitions Of character these gem\ntemen affirmed that Gen jackson was dangerous in\naRepubc-that he had never been vested with\nauthority without grossly abusing it--that he had in\nevery Instance sacrificed the law and the constitu-\nton, personal rights, the liberty of the citizen and\nhumanity itself to his ungoyernable passions-and\nthat he was disqualified by nature, by habit and by\neducation, for any civil office whatever. His pub\nlie conduct was scrutinzed with rigorous severity,\nand the Enquirer groaned under the load of denun-\nclatlon and appeals to the people to their lib\ncritics from the grasp ofthe Military Despot. Could\npossibly be imagined, that any state of things\nwould thereafter enlist the support of these gen\n4 leEaen for Gen. Jackson Could if be believed that\nmen of responsibility and sense, would in so short\natime give the lie to their former declarations, or\nsubject themselves to the suspicion of present in\nsincerity, when they profess their faith in General\nJackson's capacity 10 rule this country\n\n\nAn opposition thus vicious in its origin could be\nsupported only by means equally yicious-and hence\nthat rapid succession OF fabricated charges directed\nagainst the honor and purity of the Administration\nthe employment of such venal Instruments as dis\ngrace the American Press--the innumerable false\nmoods which are coined and thrown into circulation\nwith rapldity which has kept the people in con-\nslant state of excitement, and left them no time to\n\n\ninvestigate the truth Of one, before they called\n\"Ponto examine another Eighteen months ago, we\npronounced this opposition. farther than Virginia\nand North Carolina were engaged in it, (and drew\nupon ourselves by doing so, denunciation in the Sc\nnate of the U.

We are advised from Albany\nthat the Albany Jackson Regency have it in conten-\nplation, if they carry the Legislature at the ap-\npreaching election, TO REPEAL THE ELECt\nTORAL LAW, which the people, in their majesty,\nwrung from them two years since, and again U.s.\nURP The POWER OF APPOIN ling THE\nELEC TORS OF PRESIDENT THEMSELVES. +.\n1t is the unquestonabe determination of these men,\nthat jackson shall be President, though his trium-\npha car be wheeled over the PROSTATE liberties OF\nthe People!\n\n\nFrom, tie Nesv York National .adyocate Of, Saturday\n\n\nTIE ELECTORAL Law IN DANoER.-it is not to\nbe doubted that should the combined powerof Clinton\nand Van Buren, send to the next legislature Of this\nstate majority of persons subservient to their views\nthey would instantly make sacrifice of the elcctor\nal law, and take the choice OF President electors\ninto their own hands. After great struggle the\npeople Of this state have obtained the just privilege\nof themselves appointing the persons who shall elect\nthe President and Vice President.
