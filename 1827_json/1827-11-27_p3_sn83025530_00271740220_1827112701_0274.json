These convictions\nhave been forced upon the public by the sternest of\nenthusiastically; by the contemplation of gen.\neral poverty and decay. The public mind is freed\nfrom the prejutces SO long felt, SO ndustronsy To-\nmented by certain politicians All that was ever\nnecessary to liberate it OF its bigotry, has been\ncomplished-to bring 1t to The point Of inquiry. So\nplain simple and conclusive is the reasoning which\nproves the expediency of Virgina's engaging IN\nmauufdctures-her natural advantages, her raw ma\nteral, her water power, her coal mines, are so\nabundant and inexhaustible--her future prosperity\nis so obviously dependent upon her withdrawing\nportion of her labor and capital from the overdone\nand unproductive (unproductive because overdone)\npursuit of agrculture-tha to bring the public mind\nto think on these subjects, was one and the same\nthing AS to convince it that manufacturing was good\npolicy.
