Brandt,\npublished last evening, but were excluded for want\nof room AS at this distance from the circle in\nwhich he moves, his character may not be distinct\nly known, Ito quote the Editor of the Quebec\nMercury,) it is but justice, since his name has\nbeen brought forward, to say, that MIR. Brandt is\ngenerally respected and there need be no hesita-\nton in believing what he says lie is well edu-\nGated young man, and was as much esteemed by\nthe Officers Of the Division of His Majesty's Ar\nmy, with which he served during the last Amer\nican war, for his gentlemanly manners IN society,\nas for his courage and humanity in the field. Mr..\nBrandt some time ago visited England, and while\nthere surprised the public and the poet, Thomas\nCampbell, by letter, as crcditable to his tllial\n\n\nfeelings as to his literary attanments in which he\nsuccessfully vindicated the character OF his\ndeceased father, Joseph Brandt. from the asper-\nsons cast upon it, without sufficient inquiry, by\nMr.. Campbell, in the beautiful but unfaithful mar\nratvc poem of 6 Gertrude of Wyoming\"\n\n\nThus, then, every material point of the aledged\ndiscoveries of the celebrated New Ark Conven-\ntion, has been successively overthrown. We were\ntold that Morgan was taken to Niagara and butch\ncred, and that Mr.. Chaplin, of Buffalo, was one Of\nthe murIerers. But the story proved not to be\ntrue: We were told that traces of blood &c.\nwere found IN Fort Niagara But tnat IS NOT true\n\n\nWe were told that Capt. Brandt was consulted\nabout killing him, or putting him away; and that\nwas not true. We have all along been told, more\nover, that there was conspiracy originally, to\nget Morgan from Batavia, to Canandaigua, on\nfalse accusation OF larceny: And now jury has\nsolemnly declared that that story was likewise un-\ntrue. And one of the men convicted at Canaan\ndagua, was convicted by means of perjury.\ngentleman in one of the Upper Cana,a papers,\nunder his own signature, argues very rlausibly,\nfrom the fact of Morsan's having left that pro-\nvince over head and ears in debt, that he dares\nnot show himself there, and suggests reasons why\nae has probably gone off to the wiliernesse 0f Ohio:\nwhile it is stated in Jefferson county IN. ~\npaper that it is believed that Morgan was on board\nthe Lady of the Lake, which was, with every soul\non board. lost in December last, on Lake Ontario.\nNow amidst all these falsehoods, contradictions,\nand ahsurdlties, what are we to bcieycs",

An opposition to the measures of Go\nyernment, when founded upon principle, is entitled\nto respect and consideration, even from the Admin\nlstration to Which it is opposed. When founded\nupon different principles, or rather upon no prn-\nclple at all, but that OF combination to obtain pos\nsession OF the offices and patronage of Govern\nment, it is still useful; because ii induces caution\nand regard for public opinion, the part Of those\nwho administer the Government, which cannot fail\nto serve and protect the public interest. We must\nhave good reasons, however, before ws engage in\nan oppposltion To an existing administration, Of\nthe nature first above stated, and we never Will,\nunder any circumstances, engage in one Of the ma\nture last described\n\n\nWith respect to the present Administration Of\nthe Government. it will be remembered by all who\nread this Journal, that, at the time of its induction\nto office; on its subsequent organization; and at\nlater date, we have expressed conviction that\nthe election Of the President had been honestly\nmade, and that the President had acted wisely.\nand with exclusive regard to the public intel est,\nand to the circumstances of his election, in the\nappointment Of the Officers who preside over\nthe different Departments Of the Government, and\nrepresent our country abroad. More recently, we\nhave had occasion to say, that. Judging the Admin\nistration by its measures, we believed, for any\nthing that could see, that the election of Prpsi-\ndent by the House Of Representatives resulted\nbeneficlaly to the country. there being more 10\napprove than to disapprove in the measures Of this\nGovernment.

With talents\n\n\nenough to be a great man, he has the manners OF\ngentleman, and an enviable private character. 1t\n\n\nis only of his political principles, his notions Of\n\n\nparty discipline, and the manner in which he has\nbrought them both to bear upon the present state\nof public affairs, that we mean to speak.\n\n\nOn the occasion to which we have already refer\n\n\nred, Mr..

We protest against this re-\nyiva OF the odious principle Of the old Sedtion\nLaw, viz the right Of party to protect itself by\nor form the Press through the agency o legislation\nby Congress.\n\n\n1t was, indeed, somewhat an extraordinary CO.\nincidence, that whilst, in the other House, the\nconduct ot the Secretary Of State was arraiuned\nTor changing some Of the Publishers of the Laws.\nas though he had committed an offence meritins\nimpeachment, it should be gravely proposed, as\ndesiderntam in the Senate, that the Press, not on\nhere, but throughout the country, should be renua.\nted by the distribution OF the Public Printing, with\na view to imprnring the condition of the Press. .\nWhat has been deemed objectionable i'll Secreta\nry OF State, seems to have been thought by the |\nSenator to be perfectly fair in party in\none branch Of the Legislature, upon whose predom-\nnance IN both branches of the next Congress the\nmost confident calculations are made-wth what\naccuracy tlme will show.\n\n\nThe honorable Senator ought to be VEL, aware\nOF tie utter tutilly OF all attempts to organize the\nphbllc press.

An opposition to the measures of Go\nyernment, when founded upon principle, is entitled\nto respect and consideration, even from the Admin\nlstration to Which it is opposed. When founded\nupon different principles, or rather upon no prn-\nclple at all, but that OF combination to obtain pos\nsession OF the offices and patronage of Govern\nment, it is still useful; because ii induces caution\nand regard for public opinion, the part Of those\nwho administer the Government, which cannot fail\nto serve and protect the public interest. We must\nhave good reasons, however, before ws engage in\nan oppposltion To an existing administration, Of\nthe nature first above stated, and we never Will,\nunder any circumstances, engage in one Of the ma\nture last described\n\n\nWith respect to the present Administration Of\nthe Government. it will be remembered by all who\nread this Journal, that, at the time of its induction\nto office; on its subsequent organization; and at\nlater date, we have expressed conviction that\nthe election Of the President had been honestly\nmade, and that the President had acted wisely.\nand with exclusive regard to the public intel est,\nand to the circumstances of his election, in the\nappointment Of the Officers who preside over\nthe different Departments Of the Government, and\nrepresent our country abroad. More recently, we\nhave had occasion to say, that. Judging the Admin\nistration by its measures, we believed, for any\nthing that could see, that the election of Prpsi-\ndent by the House Of Representatives resulted\nbeneficlaly to the country. there being more 10\napprove than to disapprove in the measures Of this\nGovernment. We have yet seen nothing a. change\nthis opinion. F.\" Unwarped by party rage\" or even\nby personal attachments; wholv unconnectel\nWith the Executive Administration Of the General\nGovernment free from anv engagement UNDER\nstanding, or alliance, with any party, or party\nmen, this IS the unbiased dictate Of our deliberate\nJudgment\n\n\nThis sentiment, such as we have heretofore ey.\npressed it, We now repeat, with entire Difference\nTO the opinions of others. We have not sought to\nseduce others to our opinions still less have we\ndenounced those who have come to different con-\ncusions, or acted upon different principles, from\nus.\n\n\nRecent circumstances, however, have disclosed\nthe existence OF an organized Opposition to the\npresent Administration, the object Of which is to\nput it down, right or wrong. The first open ap-\nPllcation OF this principle having heea made, con\ntemporaneousy with its avowal, to us personally,\noccasoned us no little surprise. It is with main\nindeed, we find ourselves obliged to direct the A.\ntenton Of our readers to some features Of the\nscheme.

We protest against this re-\nyiva OF the odious principle Of the old Sedtion\nLaw, viz the right Of party to protect itself by\nor form the Press through the agency o legislation\nby Congress.\n\n\n1t was, indeed, somewhat an extraordinary CO.\nincidence, that whilst, in the other House, the\nconduct ot the Secretary Of State was arraiuned\nTor changing some Of the Publishers of the Laws.\nas though he had committed an offence meritins\nimpeachment, it should be gravely proposed, as\ndesiderntam in the Senate, that the Press, not on\nhere, but throughout the country, should be renua.\nted by the distribution OF the Public Printing, with\na view to imprnring the condition of the Press. .\nWhat has been deemed objectionable i'll Secreta\nry OF State, seems to have been thought by the |\nSenator to be perfectly fair in party in\none branch Of the Legislature, upon whose predom-\nnance IN both branches of the next Congress the\nmost confident calculations are made-wth what\naccuracy tlme will show.\n\n\nThe honorable Senator ought to be VEL, aware\nOF tie utter tutilly OF all attempts to organize the\nphbllc press.
