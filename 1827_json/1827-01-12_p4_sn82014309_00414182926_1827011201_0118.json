THE CASKET, or FIo,cers of Literature, 1 Fit anu Sentiment, which has had an uupre- | cedented increase of patrons during the last six months, will, after the present volume is finished, contain, each number, forty octave pages, printed well, on small handsome type, upon the finest paper, stitched and covered. and furnished to subscribers at the ioN price of Two Dollars and fifty cents per annum. The Casket is collection from the choicest pieces of the Saturday Evening Post, made with reference to the difference which should exist in the materials Ofa weekly pa per, and those of d monthly publication, the former of course enriched with essays. poetry, anecdotes, and those set off by recital ofthe occurrences of the week. The latter can re- ceiye little value from mere detall of events, many of which would cease to be interesting before they were recorded.\n\n The vast quantity of matter crowded, by small type, and careful arrangement into the columns of every number of the Saturday Evening Post, will in the course of month, to form an interesting and periodical N ork such as the Casket has been considered by its partial friends, and such as we intend, it shaN Dc. Notwithstanding the fact, that the Cask- ct is hut collection from the Saturday Eve hing Post, we confidently predict, and indeed we are sanctioned in the experience we alrea- dy have, that its most numerous patrons will be found among the subscribers to our weekly papcr.-A large number of those who take the :. Post'' depend upon that paper for the news of the week-it is therefore read with avidity by almost every member of the family where it is received, and this general use frequently iniuresits appearance so much as almost to render it unfit for the file, and for binding. The numbers too, by this general use, are not un- frequently lost, mutulated or entirely destroy ed, and the file thus brOken.-The Casket is calculated to prevent this inconvenience, and to furnish, at a very cheap price, all the useful matter for which the weekly paper would be desirable when bound.-In thus giving per manent form and select association to the choice pieces of our weekly contributors, it is confidently anticipated that new and success full inducements will be held out for the exer- else of superior talent, and unusual care m our literary department.-In addition to the recommendation of aeatness in the generalap-' pearance-and particular attention to the ty- geographical execution, it is our intention to embellish each number of the |\" \"Casket\" with three handsome Engravings from the hands of some of the most distinguished artists of the country. ....\n\n With these claims to patronage, the :: Gas ket'' will, as has been previously mentioned, be afforded to those who subscribe for thdt paper exclusively, at the low price of Ss,50",

He says, with good justice: .\n\n \"If there is any one constant practice that deserves execratiOn, this is it. Examine the many cases of consumption and decline now prevalent throughout our country and it will be found that first of all, the patient byscloth shoes got her feet wet which caused slight cold-before the first cold was fairly cured a second one was taken by the same careless ness and so it continues until a consumption is seated-whGn after lingering few months death ends the scene. It fact which pre- sume will not be disputed, that twenty females at least are carried out of the world by con- sumption where one male is. l believe this cannot be accounted for in any other manner than that men are not tenth part so careless of their health as ladies are. You can scarcely name prudent man who will consent to have his feet wet by thin shoes, two or three times a week; on the contrary many take a meth ed to have their boots water proof. If the la- dies think that lasting, or valentia or satin shoes are handsomer than those made of kid or leather, they are sadly mistaken, at least in the opinion of the gentlemen",

No. thing disturbed the Loneliness of the Widows chamber, save the sweet notes of the nightin- gale at intervals, and the low c0oings of the dove. The playful breeze brought on its loaded wing the perfume ofmany sweets,and the combined fragrance of the rose and the jasmine seemed in gratitude toshover around her who had raised them into beauty, and to ask why she did not smile as she was wont to do, and come and cherish them. But the lonely widow thought not of the flowers she. loved andghad nursed so tenderly. She saw not the brilliant moon, dancing throug Aeecy clouds, and then spreading abroad it's beams unobscured. She heard not the sweet bird of evening or if she did, his sweet warblng grated harshly over her souE The complain ing note of the tender dove was all that har monized with her feelings tsoothed hertroub- led spirit without even the consciousness that she heard it That anxious mother wait ed sons return. Often had she sat hours watching for him, but tonight never before had he fingered so late, and the mother fear fully awaited the cause. She sat cOmmun- ing with her God, and endeavoring to draw from that sacred source, array of hope or con- solation. Whose feverish tread is that \"Tis his !-and anxiously the widow raised the latch to look in her sons face. She did look for one moment, ,On the face once bright with smiles and the contentment of plous heart How was it changed since that once happy time! Now in feverish and brilliant excite ment it burned in radiant beauty. The motA- CT seated herselfinresigned agony. How was her beautiful boy, the pride of her years, al tered Now twas almost a raving maniac that stood as horribly erect before her.\n\n \"Yes, I'll tell you all, mother I'll tell you how your son was damned. l was wild with cursed wine when did the hellish deed- but Pm cool now. Oh yes I'm cool noio ~ and he pressed his burning brow. \"Moth- CT !'' and he spoke less wildly, ..give me your blessing 'tis my last boon:'' and he fell at her feet and threw his arms around her. The widow laid her hands on the boys head-\"Harry know not what you intend, or what great crime you have committed, but oh, my son ! mothers blessing rest upon you, and her prayers be with you, whether guilty or inocent.\"\n\n The young man sprang from his knees, pressed long kiss on those hallowed lips he had edby his wiekedness -and !. fed\n\n Next morning there was search made for \"Harry Wilson, the young .torger.-He was found drowned in the pond at the foot of his mothers garden. For the widows sake,none of the sad particulars of his crime or of his fate were noised abrUad hut all unearthly kindness was soon uunecessary--The wid owed mothers soul had reached its final glo rious home.

While we were all left, by the Government destitute of food, she, with an unweried per severance, obtained for us, by some means or other, constant supply. When the tattered state of our cloths evinced the extremity of our distress, she was ever ready to replenish Iour scanty wardrobe. When the unfeeling avarice of our keepers confined us insde or made our feet fast in stocks, she like minis tering angel, never ceased her applications to the Government. until she was authorised to ! communicate to us the grateful news of en-",

THE CASKET, or FIo,cers of Literature, 1 Fit anu Sentiment, which has had an uupre- | cedented increase of patrons during the last six months, will, after the present volume is finished, contain, each number, forty octave pages, printed well, on small handsome type, upon the finest paper, stitched and covered. and furnished to subscribers at the ioN price of Two Dollars and fifty cents per annum. The Casket is collection from the choicest pieces of the Saturday Evening Post, made with reference to the difference which should exist in the materials Ofa weekly pa per, and those of d monthly publication, the former of course enriched with essays. poetry, anecdotes, and those set off by recital ofthe occurrences of the week. The latter can re- ceiye little value from mere detall of events, many of which would cease to be interesting before they were recorded.\n\n The vast quantity of matter crowded, by small type, and careful arrangement into the columns of every number of the Saturday Evening Post, will in the course of month, to form an interesting and periodical N ork such as the Casket has been considered by its partial friends, and such as we intend, it shaN Dc. Notwithstanding the fact, that the Cask- ct is hut collection from the Saturday Eve hing Post, we confidently predict, and indeed we are sanctioned in the experience we alrea- dy have, that its most numerous patrons will be found among the subscribers to our weekly papcr.-A large number of those who take the :. Post'' depend upon that paper for the news of the week-it is therefore read with avidity by almost every member of the family where it is received, and this general use frequently iniuresits appearance so much as almost to render it unfit for the file, and for binding. The numbers too, by this general use, are not un- frequently lost, mutulated or entirely destroy ed, and the file thus brOken.-The Casket is calculated to prevent this inconvenience, and to furnish, at a very cheap price, all the useful matter for which the weekly paper would be desirable when bound.-In thus giving per manent form and select association to the choice pieces of our weekly contributors, it is confidently anticipated that new and success full inducements will be held out for the exer- else of superior talent, and unusual care m our literary department.-In addition to the recommendation of aeatness in the generalap-' pearance-and particular attention to the ty- geographical execution, it is our intention to embellish each number of the |\" \"Casket\" with three handsome Engravings from the hands of some of the most distinguished artists of the country. ....\n\n With these claims to patronage, the :: Gas ket'' will, as has been previously mentioned, be afforded to those who subscribe for thdt paper exclusively, at the low price of Ss,50",

He says, with good justice: .\n\n \"If there is any one constant practice that deserves execratiOn, this is it. Examine the many cases of consumption and decline now prevalent throughout our country and it will be found that first of all, the patient byscloth shoes got her feet wet which caused slight cold-before the first cold was fairly cured a second one was taken by the same careless ness and so it continues until a consumption is seated-whGn after lingering few months death ends the scene. It fact which pre- sume will not be disputed, that twenty females at least are carried out of the world by con- sumption where one male is. l believe this cannot be accounted for in any other manner than that men are not tenth part so careless of their health as ladies are. You can scarcely name prudent man who will consent to have his feet wet by thin shoes, two or three times a week; on the contrary many take a meth ed to have their boots water proof. If the la- dies think that lasting, or valentia or satin shoes are handsomer than those made of kid or leather, they are sadly mistaken, at least in the opinion of the gentlemen",

The playful breeze brought on its loaded wing the perfume ofmany sweets,and the combined fragrance of the rose and the jasmine seemed in gratitude toshover around her who had raised them into beauty, and to ask why she did not smile as she was wont to do, and come and cherish them. But the lonely widow thought not of the flowers she. loved andghad nursed so tenderly. She saw not the brilliant moon, dancing throug Aeecy clouds, and then spreading abroad it's beams unobscured.

The widow laid her hands on the boys head-\"Harry know not what you intend, or what great crime you have committed, but oh, my son ! mothers blessing rest upon you, and her prayers be with you, whether guilty or inocent.\"\n\n The young man sprang from his knees, pressed long kiss on those hallowed lips he had edby his wiekedness -and !. fed\n\n Next morning there was search made for \"Harry Wilson, the young .torger.-He was found drowned in the pond at the foot of his mothers garden.
